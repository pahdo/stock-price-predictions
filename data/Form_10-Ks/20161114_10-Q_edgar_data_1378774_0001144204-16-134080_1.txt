1. Organization  

Sentio Healthcare Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation,
was formed on October 16, 2006 under the Maryland General Corporation Law for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing
in and owning commercial real estate. As used in this report, the  Company ,  we ,  us  and
 our  refer to Sentio Healthcare Properties, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where context otherwise
requires. Effective January 1, 2012, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by Sentio Investments,
LLC, a Florida limited liability company that was formed on December 20, 2011 (the  Advisor ). 

Sentio Healthcare Properties OP, LP, a Delaware limited partnership
(the  Operating Partnership ), was formed on October 17, 2006. As of September 30, 2016, we owned 100% of the outstanding
common units in the Operating Partnership and the HC Operating Partnership, LP, a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. Pursuant
to the terms of the KKR Equity Commitment (as described in Note 10), we have issued Series B Convertible Preferred Units in the
Operating Partnership ( Series B Preferred Units ) to the Investor (as described in Note 10), the terms of which provide
that the Investor may convert its preferred units into common units at its discretion. On an as-converted basis, as of September
30, 2016, the Investor owns 57.9% and we own the remaining interest in the Operating Partnership and the HC Operating Partnership,
LP. We anticipate that we will conduct all or a portion of our operations through the Operating Partnership. Our financial statements
and the financial statements of the Operating Partnership are consolidated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

For more information regarding our significant accounting policies
and estimates, please refer to  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  contained in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities ( VIEs ),
we analyze our variable interests, including investments in partnerships and joint ventures, to determine if the entity in which
we have a variable interest is a variable interest entity. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews, based
on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability, risk and reward sharing
experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions
and financial agreements. We also use quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine if we must consolidate a variable interest
entity as the primary beneficiary.  

Interim Financial Information   

The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared by our management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).
Certain information and note disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC
rules and regulations. Accordingly, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information
and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying financial information reflects all adjustments which
are, in the opinion of our management, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. Our accompanying
interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto included on our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.  

Reclassifications   

On January 1, 2016 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires that debt issuance costs related to
the Company s recognized notes payable be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
the notes payable, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected.
The guidance requires retrospective adoption for all prior periods presented. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $4.1
million and $3.4 million, respectively have been reclassified from deferred financing costs to the related notes payable in the
condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

Adopted accounting standard  

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued ASU 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which requires amendments to both the variable interest
entity and voting models. The amendments (i) modify the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or
service provider), the VIE characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and primary beneficiary determination under
the VIE model, and (ii) eliminate the presumption within the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership
or similar entity. The Company concluded that the Operating Partnership now meets the criteria as a VIE under ASU 2015-02 and the
ASU was adopted as of January 1, 2016. The Company's significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership, as described
in Note 1, and consequently, substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of
the Operating Partnership. Accordingly, there is no change in the presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements
of the Company upon adoption of ASU 2015-02. 

Pending accounting standards  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230) , which indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments
are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective
of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU will not have a significant
impact on our statement of cash flows. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842) , which amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing
arrangements. It will require companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified
as operating leases under previous GAAP. This ASU retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification
criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria
for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. The new guidance will be effective
for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption
of the new guidance on its financial statements. 

In 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized
in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to
be received in exchange for those goods or services. In 2015, the FASB provided for a one-year deferral of the effective date
for ASU 2014-09 which is now effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard
will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the
standard. 

3. Real Estate Note Receivable  

On January 16, 2015, the Company, through  indirect wholly
owned subsidiaries, Sentio Georgetown, LLC and Sentio Georgetown TRS, LLC, originated a development loan in the amount of
$41.9 million for the development of The Delaney at Georgetown Village located in Georgetown, Texas (the
 Georgetown Loan ). The Georgetown Loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on the land, building, and all
improvements made thereon. The Georgetown Loan matures on January 15, 2020 with one 12-month option to extend at the
Company s option, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.9% per annum for the term of the loan. At the maturity date,
all unpaid principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest shall be due in full. Advances are made periodically during the
construction period. The borrower paid a loan origination fee equal to 1% of the loan amount. Monthly payments are interest
only for the term of the loan. The Company has the option to purchase the property at fair value at the earlier of
stabilization or 48 months from the loan origination. Fair value is determined by the average asset value of independent
appraisals obtained by the lender and borrower. Regardless of whether the Company exercises the option to purchase the
property, the Company will be entitled to participate in the value creation which is the difference between the fair value
and the total development cost. The Georgetown Loan is non-recourse to the borrowers, but one of the entities affiliated with
the borrower has provided cost and completion guarantees as well as a guaranty of customary  bad boy 
carve-outs. 

Interest revenue on the loan receivable is recognized as earned
based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risks. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, interest revenue from the real estate note receivable was $0.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Interest
revenue is recorded as a component of tenant reimbursements and other income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
As of September 30, 2016, the borrower had made draws on the Georgetown Loan totaling $31.6 million, and the remaining commitment
from the Company is approximately $10.3 million. 

4. Investments in Real Estate  

As of September 30, 2016, cost and accumulated depreciation
and amortization related to real estate assets and related lease intangibles were as follows: 

As of December 31, 2015, cost and accumulated depreciation
and amortization related to real estate assets and related lease intangibles were as follows: 

Depreciation
expense associated with buildings and improvements and furniture, fixtures, and vehicles for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively. 

Depreciation expense associated with buildings and improvements
and furniture, fixtures, and vehicles for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $11.0 million
and $10.0 million, respectively. 

Estimated amortization associated with intangible lease
assets for October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and each of the subsequent years is as follows: 

The estimated useful lives for intangible assets range from
approximately two to 21 years. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets was 17
years. 

5. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company owns interests in the
following entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting: 

(1)  
      These entities are not consolidated because the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control or direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s performance.   
 
      (2)  
      Represents the carrying value of the Company s investment in the unconsolidated entities.   

Summarized combined financial information for the Company s
unconsolidated entities is as follows: 

(1)  
      On January 28, 2014, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we acquired a 25% interest in a joint venture entity that has developed Buffalo Crossings, a 108-unit, assisted living community, which commenced operations in May 2015.   

6. Income Taxes  

For federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be taxed
as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the  Code ), beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2008, which imposes limitations related
to operating assisted-living properties. Generally, to qualify as a REIT, we cannot directly operate assisted-living facilities.
However, such facilities may generally be operated by a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ) pursuant to a lease with the
Company. Therefore, we have formed Master HC TRS, LLC ( Master TRS ), a wholly owned subsidiary of HC Operating Partnership,
LP, to lease any assisted-living properties we acquire and to operate the assisted-living properties pursuant to contracts with
unaffiliated management companies. The Company made the applicable election for Master TRS to qualify as a TRS. Under the management
contracts, the management companies have direct control of the daily operations of these assisted-living properties. 

Each TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying
deferred tax assets and liabilities. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than
not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of
their net recorded amount, we would establish a valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 

The Master TRS recognized a $0.4 million benefit and a $0.9
million benefit for federal and state income taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a $1.3
million benefit and a $2.6 million benefit for federal and state income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Net deferred tax assets related to the TRS entities totaled approximately $7.3 million at September 30, 2016
and $6.0 million at December 31, 2015, respectively, related primarily to book and tax basis differences for straight-line
rent and accrued liabilities. At September 30, 2016, the Master TRS had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax
purposes of approximately $2.3 million, which if unused, begin to expire in 2035. Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent
in part upon generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. Deferred tax assets are included in deferred costs and other
assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We have not recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets
as of September 30, 2016, as we have determined that the future projected taxable income from the operations of the TRS entities
are sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets. 

7. Segment Reporting  

As of September 30, 2016, we operated in three reportable business
segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: senior living operations, triple-net leased properties, and
medical office building ( MOB ) properties. These operating segments are the segments of the Company for which separate
financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our senior living operations segment primarily consists of
investments in senior housing communities located in the United States for which we engage independent third-party managers. Our
triple-net leased properties segment consists of investments in senior living, skilled nursing and hospital facilities in the United
States. These facilities are leased to healthcare operating companies under long-term  triple-net  or  absolute-net 
leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. Our MOB properties segment primarily consists of investing
in medical office buildings and leasing those properties to healthcare providers under long-term leases, which may require tenants
to pay property-related expenses. 

We evaluate performance of the combined properties in each segment
based on net operating income. Net operating income is defined as total revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses.
There are no intersegment sales or transfers. We use net operating income to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate
investments and to make decisions concerning the operation of the property. We believe that net operating income is useful to investors
in understanding the value of income-producing real estate. Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to
net operating income; however, net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator
of operating performance as it excludes certain items such as depreciation and amortization, asset management fees, real estate
acquisition costs, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. Additionally, net operating income as we
define it may not be comparable to net operating income as defined by other REITs or companies. 

The following tables reconcile the segment activity to consolidated
net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The following table reconciles the segment
activity to consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

8. Fair Value Measurements  

The FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
825-10,  Financial Instruments,  requires the disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether
or not recognized on the face of the balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate that value. 

Fair value represents the estimate of the proceeds to be received,
or paid in the case of a liability, in a current transaction between willing parties. ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement  
establishes a fair value hierarchy to categorize the inputs used in valuation techniques to measure fair value. Inputs are either
observable or unobservable in the marketplace. Observable inputs are based on market data from independent sources and unobservable
inputs reflect the reporting entity s assumptions about market participant assumptions used to value an asset or liability. 

Our balance sheets include the following financial instruments:
cash and cash equivalents,  tenant and other receivables, net, deferred costs and other assets, restricted
cash, notes payable, net, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, prepaid rent and security deposits and distributions payable.
With the exception of notes payable and our contingent consideration discussed below, we consider the carrying values of our financial
instruments to approximate fair value because they generally expose the Company to limited credit risk and because of the short
period of time between origination of the financial assets and liabilities and their expected settlement. 

As of September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the
contingent consideration related to the Sumter Grand and Armbrook Village acquisitions is $8.7 million, which represents a
change in fair value of ($0.1) million and $0.2 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016,
respectively. The change in fair value of contingent consideration is due to a change in the projected timing to achieve
certain specified net operating income thresholds for the Sumter Grand and Armbrook Village properties. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid the entire Gables of Hudson earnout of $2.2 million and $1.8 million of the
Armbrook Village earnout, as the first tier of the net operating income threshold was met in June 2016. The liabilities are
included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on
significant inputs which are not observable to the market and as a result are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value is derived by making assumptions on the timing of the lease up process based on actual performance as compared
to internal underwriting models and applying a discount rate in the range of 9.0% to 12.0% to the actual liabilities to obtain
a present value. 

The fair value of the Company s notes payable is
estimated by discounting future cash flows of each instrument at rates that reflect the current market rates available to the
Company for debt of the same terms and maturities. The fair value of the notes payable was determined using Level 2 inputs of
the fair value hierarchy. Based on the estimates used by the Company, the fair value of notes payable was $356.2 million and $337.9
million, compared to the carrying values of $357.4 million ($353.2 million, net of discount and deferred financing costs) and
$338.7 million ($335.3 million, net of discount and deferred financing costs) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

There were no transfers between Level 1 or 2 during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

9. Notes Payable  

Notes payable were $357.4 million ($353.2 million, net of discount
and deferred financing costs) and $338.7 million ($335.3 million, net of discount and deferred financing costs) as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had fixed and variable rate secured mortgage loans
with effective interest rates ranging from 2.76% to 6.43% per annum and a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.19% per
annum. As of September 30, 2016, notes payable consisted of $194.6 million of fixed rate debt, or approximately 54% of notes payable,
at a weighted average interest rate of 4.74% per annum and $162.7 million of variable rate debt, or approximately 46% of
notes payable, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.53% per annum. As of December 31, 2015, we had $179.0 million
of fixed rate debt, or 53% of notes payable, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.78% per annum and $159.7 million of variable
rate debt, or 47% of notes payable, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.17% per annum. 

On August 19, 2016, we entered into three Multifamily Loan
and Security Agreements (the  Loans ) with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank ), an unaffiliated lender,
originated under Fannie Mae s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Product Line for aggregate borrowings of approximately
$54.6 million, to refinance our Spring Village at Wildewood, Gables of Hudson, and Sumter Place properties. The Loans bear
interest at a variable rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.66% for a term of 10 years. Loan payments are interest only for the first
five years of the loan term, after which we will also be obligated to repay principal in specified fixed monthly amounts. All
unpaid principal and accrued interest will be payable upon the maturity of each loan. The Loans are secured by the refinanced
properties. We may prepay each Loan in full at any time (1) after September 1, 2017 and until May 31, 2026 upon payment of a prepayment
premium equal to 1% of the principal amount prepaid, and (2) after May 31, 2026 with no prepayment premium. In connection with
documentation and closing of the Loans, we paid fees and expenses totaling approximately $1.4 million. 

On August 19, 2016, we entered into a Secured
Loan Agreement with KeyBank, with an aggregate loan amount of approximately $62.1 million (the  Portfolio Loan ),
of which approximately $57.0 million in principal is currently outstanding. The Portfolio Loan represents a refinancing
and is secured by our Woodbury Mews, Sumter Grand, Mesa Vista Inn Health Center, Live Oaks Village of Hammond and Slidell
properties. The Portfolio Loan has an initial term of three years with a one-year extension fee available upon payment of an
extension equal to 0.25% of the loan amount. The Portfolio Loan bears interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 3.0%. In
connection with the closing of the Portfolio Loan, we paid fees and expenses of $1.1 million, including a commitment fee of
approximately $698,000 to the lender. We may prepay the Portfolio Loan at any time, subject to certain conditions. Payments
on the loans are due monthly and consist of accrued interest-only during the initial two years. Beginning in the third year,
payments will consist of interest plus principal amortization payments based upon a 30-year amortization schedule. As a
condition to obtaining the Portfolio Loan, we provided KeyBank with a limited guaranty of 30% of the outstanding loan
amount. 

In connection with the closing of the loans described above,
the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of $0.4 million, which is included in loss on debt extinguishment
and other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

On August 31, 2016, we entered into a
Participation Agreement (the  Participation Agreement ) among Red Capital Partners, LLC ( Red
Capital ), an unaffiliated lender, and Sentio Georgetown, LLC and Sentio Georgetown TRS, LLC, which are wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company. Pursuant to the Participation Agreement, Red Capital entered into a $20.0 million senior
participation interest (the  Red Capital Loan ) in the Georgetown Loan (refer to Note 3). In connection with the
closing of the Red Capital Loan, the Company paid a commitment fee of $200,000 to Red Capital. The Red Capital Loan bears
interest at a rate of 5.25% and matures on January 15, 2020, which is coterminous with the Georgetown Loan. Loan payments are
interest only for the full term of the Red Capital Loan. The Red Capital Loan has a one-year extension available upon payment
of a fee equal to 0.5% of the Red Capital Loan amount.  As of September 30, 2016, Red Capital has funded $9.7
million under the Red Capital Loan and plans to fund the remainder as the Company receives draw requests on the Georgetown
Loan. 

We are required by the terms of the applicable loan documents
to meet certain financial covenants, such as debt service coverage ratios, rent coverage ratios and reporting requirements. As
of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements. 

Principal payments due on our notes payable for October 1,
2016 to December 31, 2016 and each of the subsequent years is as follows: 

Interest Expense and Deferred Financing Cost  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company incurred interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs of $4.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred interest expense, including amortization of deferred
financing costs of $11.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company s net deferred financing costs were approximately $4.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively. All deferred financing
costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the respective loan agreement. 

10. Stockholders  Equity  

Common Stock   

Our charter authorizes the issuance of 580,000,000 shares of
common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share,
of which 1,000 shares are designated as Senior Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (the  Series C Preferred Stock ).
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including distributions reinvested, we had issued approximately 13.4 million shares
and 13.3 million shares of common stock for a total of approximately $133.5 million and $132.3 million of gross proceeds, respectively,
in our public offerings. 

Preferred Stock and OP Units   

On February 10, 2013, we entered into a series of agreements,
which have been amended at various points after February 10, 2013, with Sentinel RE Investment Holdings LP (the  Investor ),
an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Co. L.P. (together with its affiliates,  KKR ) for the purpose of obtaining
equity funding to finance investment opportunities (such investment and the related agreements, as amended, are referred to herein
collectively as the  KKR Equity Commitment ). Pursuant to the KKR Equity Commitment, we could issue and sell to the
Investor and its affiliates on a private placement basis from time to time over a period of up to three years, up to $158.7 million
in aggregate issuance amount of preferred securities in the Company and the Operating Partnership. At September 30, 2016, no securities
remain issuable under the KKR Equity Commitment.  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had issued
1,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 1,586,000 Series B Preferred Units to the Investor for a total commitment of $158.7
million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has received $156.3 million of the total commitment and $2.3 million
of equity remains to be funded under the KKR Equity Commitment which will be drawn by the Company to fund the Georgetown Loan.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $3.9 million and $18.3 million of proceeds from KKR
related to previously issued Series B Preferred Units. The Series B Preferred Units outstanding are classified within noncontrolling
interests and are convertible into approximately 15,830,938 shares of the Company s common stock, as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. 

The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company s
common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation. The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled
to receive dividends, as and if authorized by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose, at an annual
rate equal to 3% of the liquidation preference for each share. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are payable annually
in arrears. 

The Series B Preferred Units rank senior to the Operating Partnership s
common units with respect to distribution rights and rights on liquidation. With the exception of certain Series B Preferred Units
issued in connection with the put exercise related to the Georgetown Loan (the  Georgetown Put ), the Series B Preferred
Units are entitled to receive cash distributions at an annual rate equal to 7.5% of the Series B liquidation preference in preference
to any distributions paid to common units. In December 2014, the parties amended the Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
Agreement (the  Partnership Agreement ) to provide that the Series B Preferred Units issued in connection with the
Georgetown Put would receive cash distributions at a reduced annual rate equal to 6.0%. In addition, the preferred return for
the Series B Preferred Units issued in connection with the Georgetown Put would be calculated based solely on the exercise put
amount that has been funded. Effective August 31, 2016, the parties further amended the Partnership Agreement to provide that
219,120 Series B Preferred Units issued in connection with the Georgetown Put would continue receiving cash distributions at an
annual rate of 6.0% and the remaining 200,000 Series B Preferred Units issued in connection with the Georgetown Put will receive
cash distributions at an annual rate of 7.5%. If the Operating Partnership is unable to pay cash distributions, distributions
will be paid in kind at an annual rate of 10.0% of the Series B liquidation preference. 

After payment of the preferred
distributions, additional distributions will be paid first to the common units until they have received an aggregate blended return
equal to a weighted average interest rate determined taking into account the Series B Preferred Units receiving a 6.0% return
and the Series B Preferred Units receiving a 7.5% return per unit in annual distributions commencing from February 10, 2013, and
thereafter to the common units and Series B Preferred Units pro rata. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Operating Partnership paid distributions on the Series B Preferred Units in the amount of $2.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Operating Partnership paid distributions on the Series B Preferred
Units in the amount of $2.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively. 

Distributions Available to Common Stockholders  

The following are the distributions declared on our common
stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

(1)  
      In order to meet the requirements
for being treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must pay distributions to our stockholders each taxable year equal
to least 90% of our net ordinary taxable income.     
 
      (2)      
      This table represents
    distributions declared to common stockholders for each respective period. These amounts do not include distribution payments
    to the Series B Preferred Unit holders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

Commencing with the declaration of distributions for daily
record dates occurring in the second quarter of 2013 and thereafter, our board of directors has declared distributions on our
common stock in amounts per share that, if declared and paid each day for a 365-day period, would equate to an annualized rate
of $0.50 per share (5.00% based on the initial purchase price of our common stock of $10.00). 

In connection with the Participation Agreement (as described
in Note 9), the Board of Directors adopted a Regular Quarterly Dividend Policy (the  Dividend Policy ), which documents
the circumstances under which the Board of Directors may increase the regular quarterly dividend that may be paid to holders of
the common stock of the Company (the  Regular Quarterly Dividend Rate ) from its current level of $0.125 per share
without the consent of the Investor. The Dividend Policy provides that the Company may maintain the Regular Quarterly Dividend
Rate at the current level and that the Company may also elect to reduce the Regular Quarterly Dividend Rate in its discretion.
The policy expires on August 31, 2019. 

The declaration of distributions is at the discretion of our
board of directors and our board will determine the amount of distributions on a regular basis. The amount of distributions will
depend on our funds from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. 

11. Earnings Per Share  

We report earnings (loss) per share pursuant to ASC Topic 260,
 Earnings  per Share .  Basic earnings (loss) per share attributable for all periods presented are computed by
dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share attributable to common stockholders are computed based on the
weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. The Series B Preferred
Units give rise to potentially dilutive securities of our common stock. As of September 30, 2016 there were 1,586,000 Series B
Preferred Units outstanding, but such units were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares
were anti-dilutive during these periods. 

12. Related Party Transactions  

Advisory Relationship with the Advisor   

We have been party to an Advisory Agreement with the Advisor
since January 1, 2012. The Advisory Agreement has been renewed since 2012 for additional one-year terms commencing on January
1, 2013, January 1, 2014, January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2016. Certain provisions of the Advisory Agreement were
amended as a result of the execution on February 10, 2013 of a Transition to Internal Management Agreement which was subsequently
amended in April 2014 and February 2015 (as amended, the  Transition Agreement ) with the Advisor. 

Pursuant to the provisions of the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor
is responsible for managing, operating, directing and supervising the operation of our company and its assets. Generally, the
Advisor is responsible for providing us with (i) property acquisition, disposition and financing services, (ii) asset management
and operational services, including real estate services and financial and administrative services, (iii) stockholder services,
and (iv) in the event we conduct a public offering of our securities, offering-related services. The Advisor is subject to the
supervision and ultimate authority of our board of directors and has a fiduciary duty to us and our stockholders. 

The Advisory Agreement with our Advisor and the terms of the
Transition Agreement are more fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The fees payable to the Advisor under the Advisory Agreement
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were as follows: 

The Transition Agreement limits the amount of the fees payable
under our existing Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. Specifically, notwithstanding the provisions of the Advisory Agreement,
acquisition fees, financing coordination fees, asset management fees, property management and leasing fees, and disposition fees
payable under the Advisory Agreement are limited to an amount no more than (1) $3.2 million plus an excess amount of $3.2 million
(the  Excess Fee Amount ) from February 10, 2013 to February 10, 2014, and (2) $3.2 million plus any remaining portion
of the Excess Fee Amount during the period from the February 11, 2014 to February 10, 2015. The maximum aggregate amount of such
fees payable to the Advisor from February 10, 2013 through February 10, 2015 under these limits was $9.6 million (the  Maximum
Fee Amount ). Solely with respect to any fees earned by the Advisor during the period from February 11, 2014 to February
10, 2015 in excess of the Maximum Fee Amount, such fees will be included in fees payable during the one-year period from February
11, 2015 to February 10, 2016, subject to a maximum amount of $1.0 million. For the one-year period from February 11, 2015 to
February 10, 2016, as well as for the one-year period from February 11, 2016 to February 10, 2017, the same limits will apply
to the aggregate fees the Advisor can earn such that the aggregate amount of such fees payable to the Advisor from February 11,
2015 to February 10, 2017 is equal to the Maximum Fee Amount. As of November 2015, the  Maximum Fee Amount  that could
be earned from February 10, 2013 to February 10, 2015 of $9.6 million had been met, and as of July 2016 the  Maximum Fee
Amount  that could be earned from February 10, 2016 to February 10, 2017 of $3.2 million had been met. 

KKR Equity Commitment   

Pursuant to the KKR Equity Commitment, we could issue and sell
to the Investor and its affiliates on a private placement basis from time to time over a period of three years, up to $158.7 million
in aggregate issuance amount of shares of newly issued Series C Preferred Stock and newly issued Series B Preferred Units to fund
real estate acquisitions, a self-tender offer and the origination of a development loan. As a result of the transactions contemplated
by the KKR Equity Commitment, the Investor currently beneficially owns an aggregate of 15,830,938 shares of common stock of the
Company, which represents, in the aggregate, approximately 57.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30,
2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the KKR
Equity Commitment, the Investor had purchased 1,000 newly issued Series C Preferred Stock and 1,586,000 newly issued Series B
Preferred Units for an aggregate purchase price of $158.7 million. As of September 30, 2016 no Series B Preferred Units remain
issuable under the KKR Equity Commitment. 

The terms of the KKR Equity Commitment are more fully described
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

13. Commitments and Contingencies  

We monitor our properties for the presence of hazardous or
toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist, we are not currently
aware of any environmental liability with respect to the properties that we believe would have a material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any environmental liability or any unasserted claim
or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording
of a loss contingency. 

Our commitments and contingencies include the usual obligations
of real estate owners and operators in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, these matters are not expected
to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. We are not presently
subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Company which if determined
unfavorably to us would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. 

Refer to Note 3  Real Estate Note Receivable  for
additional information on the remaining commitment to fund our real estate note receivable. 

Item 2.   
       Management s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

The following  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes
thereto contained elsewhere in this report. This section contains forward-looking statements, including estimates, projections,

statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC. 

Our actual future results and trends may differ materially
from expectations depending on a variety of factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. These factors include without limitation: 

Changes
    in international, national and local economic conditions in the real estate and healthcare markets specifically and in the
    broader financial markets;   

legislative
    and regulatory changes impacting the healthcare industry, including the implementation of the healthcare reform legislation
    enacted in 2010;   

legislative
    and regulatory changes impacting real estate investment trusts, or REITs, including their taxation;   

volatility
    or uncertainty in capital markets, including the availability of debt and equity capital;   

changes
    in interest rates;   

competition
    in the real estate industry;   

the supply
    and demand for operating properties in our market areas; and   

changes
    in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.   

Overview  

We were incorporated on October 16, 2006 for the purpose
of engaging in the business of investing in and owning commercial real estate and real estate-related assets. We intend to invest
primarily in healthcare properties and other real estate-related assets related to healthcare located in markets in the United
States. 

Our business has been managed by an external advisor since
the commencement of our initial public offering in June 2008 and we have no employees. Since January 1, 2012, our Advisor has
managed our business pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor is responsible
for conducting our operations and managing our portfolio of real estate and real estate-related assets. In addition, to the extent
we make additional investments, the Advisor is responsible for identifying and making acquisitions and investments on our behalf.
Our Advisor has contractual and fiduciary responsibilities to us and our stockholders. 

On February 10, 2013, we entered into the KKR Equity Commitment
for the purpose of obtaining equity funding to finance investment opportunities. Pursuant to the KKR Equity Commitment, we could
issue and sell to the Investor and its affiliates on a private placement basis from time to time over a period of up to three
years, up to $158.7 million in aggregate issuance amount of preferred securities in the Company and the Operating Partnership.
No securities remain issuable under the KKR Equity Commitment. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had issued and outstanding 11,524,370
shares of common stock, and 1,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. All 1,000 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock were issued
to the Investor pursuant to the KKR Equity Commitment. In addition, as of September 30, 2016 the Operating Partnership had issued
and outstanding 11,544,370 Common Units, 1,000 Series A Preferred Units, and 1,586,000 Series B Preferred Units. 

In connection with the KKR Equity Commitment, we entered into
the Transition Agreement with our Advisor and the Investor which sets forth the terms for a transition to an internal management
structure for the Company. The Transition Agreement requires that, unless the parties agree otherwise, the existing external advisory
structure will remain in place upon substantially the same terms as currently in effect until February 10, 2017, upon which time
the advisory function may be internalized in accordance with procedures set forth in the Transition Agreement. 

We commenced an initial public offering of our common stock
on June 20, 2008. We stopped making offers under the initial public offering on February 3, 2011 after raising gross offering
proceeds of $123.9 million from the sale of approximately 12.4 million shares, including shares sold under the distribution reinvestment
plan. On February 4, 2011, we commenced a follow-on offering of our common stock. We suspended primary offering sales in our follow-on
offering on April 29, 2011 and completed the final sale of shares under the distribution reinvestment plan on May 10, 2011. We
raised gross offering proceeds under the follow-on offering of $8.4 million from the sale of approximately 800,000 shares, including
shares sold under the distribution reinvestment plan. On June 12, 2013, we deregistered all remaining unsold follow-on offering
shares. 

On June 19, 2013, we filed a registration statement on Form
S-3 to register up to $99,000,000 of shares of common stock to be offered to our existing stockholders pursuant to the distribution
reinvestment plan (the  DRIP Offering ). The purchase price for shares offered pursuant to the DRIP Offering is equal
to the most recently announced estimated per-share value, as of the date the shares are purchased under the distribution reinvestment
plan. The DRIP Offering shares were initially offered at a purchase price of $10.02; effective February 28, 2014, DRIP Offering
shares were offered at a purchase price of $11.63 per share; and effective March 23, 2016 DRIP Offering shares are being offered
at $12.45, which is our most recent estimated per-share value. 

Our revenues, which are comprised largely of rental income,
include rents reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of each lease. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability
to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; and (ii) control
operating and other expenses, including maximizing tenant recoveries as provided for in lease structures. Our operations are impacted
by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting
policies as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the
SEC. 

Results of Operations  

As of September 30, 2016, we operated in three
reportable business segments: senior living operations, triple-net leased properties, and medical office building
( MOB ) properties. Our senior living operations segment invests in and directs the operations of independent
living, assisted-living, memory care and other senior housing communities located in the United States. We engage independent
third party managers to operate these properties. Our triple-net leased properties segment invests in healthcare properties
in the United States leased under long-term  triple-net  or  absolute-net  leases, which require the
tenants to pay all property-related expenses. Our MOB segment invests in medical office buildings and leases those properties
to healthcare providers under long-term  full service  leases which may require tenants to reimburse property
related expenses to us. 

As of September 30, 2016, we owned or had joint
venture interests in 34 properties. These properties included 26 memory care, assisted-and independent-living facilities,
which comprise our senior housing segment, one medical office building, which comprises our MOB segment, four operating
healthcare facilities, which comprise our triple-net leased segment, one in-development facility, and two facilities held
as unconsolidated entities. As of September 30, 2015, we owned or had joint venture interests in 34 properties. These
properties included 25 memory care, assisted-and independent-living facilities, which comprise our senior housing segment,
one medical office building, which comprises our MOB segment, four operating healthcare facilities, which comprise our
triple-net leased segment,  two in-development facilities, and two facilities held as unconsolidated entities. Sumter Grand
was acquired in the first quarter of 2015, and Gables of Kentridge and Armbrook Village were acquired in the second quarter
of 2015. Each of these properties are included in our senior living operations segment. We had no acquisition activity during
2016. The results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 vary largely as a result
of acquisition activity. 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

(1)    Net
                                         operating income, a non-GAAP supplemental measure, is defined as total revenue less property
                                         operating and maintenance expenses. We use net operating income to evaluate the operating
                                         performance of our consolidated real estate investments and to make decisions concerning
                                         the operation of the property. We believe that net operating income is useful to investors
                                         in understanding the value of our consolidated income-producing real estate. Net income
                                         is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to net operating income; however,
                                         net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the
                                         primary indicator of operating performance as it excludes certain items such as a gain
                                         or loss from investments in unconsolidated entities depreciation and amortization, interest
                                         expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. Additionally, net operating
                                         income as we define it may not be comparable to net operating income as defined by other
                                         REITs or companies.  

Senior Living Operations   

Total revenue for senior living operations includes rental
revenue and resident fees and service income. Property operating and maintenance expenses include labor, food, utilities,
marketing, management and other property operating costs. Net operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016
increased to $9.2 million from $7.7 million primarily as a result of the  net operating income generated at The
Parkway, which began operations in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, interest revenue from the Georgetown Loan
increased tenant reimbursement and other income due to additional  draws by the borrower. 

Triple-Net Leased Properties   

Total revenue for triple-net leased properties includes rental
revenue and expense reimbursements from tenants. Property operating and maintenance expenses include insurance and property taxes
and other operating expenses reimbursed by our tenants. Net operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016
of $2.3 million was comparable to the net operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Medical Office Building Properties   

Total revenue for medical office building properties
includes rental revenue and expense reimbursements from tenants. Property operating and maintenance expenses include
utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Net operating income for the three months  ended
September 30, 2016 of $0.2 million was comparable to net operating income for the three-month period ended September 30,
2015 

Unallocated (expenses) income   

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 of $0.4 million was comparable to general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Asset management fees for the three months ended September
30, 2016 decreased to $0.5 million from $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the advisor
achieving the maximum fee amount for the period of February 11, 2016 through February 10, 2017 during the period ended September
30, 2016. 

Real estate acquisition costs for the three months ended September
30, 2016 decreased to $0.0 million from $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of no acquisition
activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased to $3.8 million from $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to higher
depreciation and amortization in 2015 resulting from acquisitions, particularly amortization of the in-place leases for
senior living facilities acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first and second quarters of 2015. These assets are
generally amortized in the first twelve months after closing. 

Interest expense, net, for the three months ended September
30, 2016 increased to $4.2 million from $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of the
debt incurred for acquisitions that occurred in the first and second quarters of 2015 and the consolidation of The Parkway, which
began operations in the third quarter of 2015. 

The change in fair value of contingent consideration decreased
to ($0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015
due to a change in the projected timing to achieve certain specified net operating income thresholds for the Sumter Grand and
Armbrook Village properties. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid $1.8 million of the Armbrook Village
earnout, as the first tier of the net operating income threshold was met in June 2016. 

The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment in the
amount of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of the refinancing of the secured loan agreements
with KeyBank for Mesa Vista Inn Health Center, Live Oaks of Hammond, Live Oaks of Slidell, Spring Village at Wildewood, Gables
of Hudson, Sumter Place, Sumter Grand and Woodbury Mews. 

The Company recognized a loss from unconsolidated entities
of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was comparable to the loss recognized for three months ended
September 30, 2015. The Company s allocation of loss from unconsolidated entities relates to the operations of Buffalo Crossings
and Physicians Center MOB. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
we recognized state and federal income tax benefit of approximately $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, related to the
operations of our senior living properties that were consolidated into our Master TRS. The decrease relates to the lower amortization
of in-place lease value associated with properties acquired in late 2014 and early 2015. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015  

(1)  
      Net operating
    income, a non-GAAP supplemental measure, is defined as total revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses. We
    use net operating income to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate investments and to make decisions
    concerning the operation of the property. We believe that net operating income is useful to investors in understanding the
    value of our consolidated income-producing real estate. Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to
    net operating income; however, net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary
    indicator of operating performance as it excludes certain items such as a gain or loss from investments in unconsolidated
    entities depreciation and amortization, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. Additionally,
    net operating income as we define it may not be comparable to net operating income as defined by other REITs or companies.   

Senior Living Operations   

Total revenue for senior living operations includes rental
revenue and resident fees and service income. Property operating and maintenance expenses include labor, food, utilities,
marketing, management and other property operating costs. Net operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
increased to $27.2 million from $22.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily
due to the acquisitions of Sumter Grand, Gables of Kentridge, and Armbrook Village in the first and second quarters of 2015
and the opening of The Parkway in the third quarter of 2015. The increase also reflects charges for higher levels of care
at several senior living properties in the portfolio. 

Triple-Net Leased Properties   

Total revenue for triple-net leased properties includes rental
revenue and expense reimbursements from tenants. Property operating and maintenance expenses include insurance and property taxes
and other operating expenses reimbursed by our tenants. Net operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
increased to $7.4 million from $7.0 million primarily as a result of a $1.3 million lease termination fee received from the prior
tenant at the Global Inpatient Rehab facility, which was offset by a $0.7 million write off of the straight-line receivable. The
Company entered into a lease with a new tenant, Children s Health System of Texas, and expects net operating income to normalize
throughout the remainder of 2016. 

Medical Office Building Properties   

Total revenue for medical office building properties includes
rental revenue and expense reimbursements from tenants. Property operating and maintenance expenses include utilities, repairs
and maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Net operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $0.6 million
is comparable to net operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Unallocated (expenses) income   

General and administrative expenses decreased to $1.5
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease was primarily due to $0.6 million in costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 by our board of
directors, along with its advisors, to evaluate strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value. 

Asset management fees for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased to $3.2 million from $4.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the advisor
achieving the maximum fee amount for the period of February 11, 2016 through February 10, 2017 during the period ended
September 30, 2016. 

Real estate acquisition costs for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased to $0.0 million from $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of no acquisition
activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation and amortization for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $12.7 million from $15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due
to higher depreciation and amortization in 2015 resulting from acquisitions, particularly amortization of the in-place leases
for senior living facilities acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first and second quarters of 2015. These assets
are generally amortized in the first twelve months after closing. 

Interest expense, net, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 increased to $11.8 million from $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a
result of the debt incurred for acquisitions that occurred in the first and second quarters of 2015 and the consolidation of
The Parkway, which began operations in the third quarter of 2015. 

The change in fair value of contingent consideration decreased
to $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due
to a change in the projected timing to achieve certain specified net operating income thresholds for the Sumter Grand and Armbrook
Village properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid the entire Gables of Hudson earnout of $2.2
million and $1.8 million of the Armbrook Village earnout, as the first tier of the net operating income threshold was met in June
2016. 

The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment in the
amount of $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of the refinancing of the secured loan agreements
with KeyBank for Mesa Vista Inn Health Center, Live Oaks of Hammond, Live Oaks of Slidell, Spring Village at Wildewood, Gables
of Hudson, Sumter Place, Sumter Grand and Woodbury Mews. 

The Company recognized a loss from unconsolidated entities
of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was comparable to the loss of $0.3 million recognized for
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s allocation of loss from unconsolidated entities relates to the operations
of Buffalo Crossings and Physicians Center MOB. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recognized state and federal income tax benefit of approximately $1.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to our senior
living properties consolidated into our Master TRS. This decrease relates to the lower amortization of in-place lease value associated
with properties acquired in late 2014 and early 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

On June 19, 2013, we filed a registration statement on Form
S-3 to register up to $99,000,000 of shares of common stock to be offered to our existing stockholders pursuant to the DRIP Offering.
The purchase price for shares offered pursuant to the DRIP Offering is equal to the most recently announced estimated per-share
value, as of the date the shares are purchased under the distribution reinvestment plan. The DRIP Offering shares were initially
offered at a purchase price of $10.02; effective February 28, 2014, DRIP offering shares were offered at a purchase price of $11.63
per share; and effective March 23, 2016 DRIP offering shares are being offered at $12.45, which is our most recent estimated per-share
value. 

On February 10, 2013, we entered into the KKR Equity Commitment
for the purpose of obtaining equity funding to finance investment opportunities. Pursuant to the KKR Equity Commitment, we could
issue and sell to the Investor and its affiliates on a private placement basis from time to time over a period of up to three
years, up to $158.7 million in aggregate issuance amount of preferred securities in the Company and the Operating Partnership.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company has received $156.3 million of the total commitment and $2.3 million of equity remains to
be funded in connection with the Georgetown Loan. No securities remain issuable under the KKR Equity Commitment. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had issued and outstanding 11,524,370
shares of common stock, and 1,000 shares of 3% Senior Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (the  Series C Preferred Stock ).
All 1,000 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock were issued to the Investor pursuant to the KKR Equity Commitment. In addition,
as of September 30, 2016 the Operating Partnership had issued and outstanding 11,544,370 Common Units, 1,000 Series A Preferred
Units (the  Series A Preferred Units ), and 1,586,000 Series B Convertible Preferred Units (the  Series B Preferred
Units ). As of September 30, 2016, we held all of the issued and outstanding Common Units and all of the issued and outstanding
Series A Preferred Units. All of the issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Units were issued to the Investor in connection
with the KKR Equity Commitment. 

We expect that our primary sources of capital will consist
of debt financing, net cash flows from operations and net proceeds from preferred units of partnership interest in our Operating
Partnership committed and funded in accordance with the terms of the KKR Equity Commitment. We expect that our primary uses of
capital will be for real estate investments, including earnouts and promote monetization payments, payment of tenant improvements
and capital improvements, operating expenses, including interest expense on any outstanding indebtedness, reducing outstanding
indebtedness and for the payment of distributions. 

We intend to own our stabilized properties with low to moderate
levels of debt financing. We incur moderate to high levels of indebtedness when acquiring development or value-added properties
and possibly other real estate investments. For our stabilized core plus properties, our long-term goal is to use low to moderate
levels of debt financing with leverage ranging from 50% to 65% of the value of the asset. For development and value-added properties,
our goal is to acquire and develop or redevelop these properties using moderate to high levels of debt financing with leverage
ranging from 65% to 75% of the cost of the asset. Once these properties are developed, redeveloped and stabilized with tenants,
we will reduce the levels of debt to fall within the loan to value target debt ranges appropriate for core properties. While we
seek to fall within the outlined targets on a portfolio basis, for any specific property we may exceed these estimates. To the
extent we do not have sufficient proceeds to reduce debt financing to the target ranges within a reasonable time as determined
by our board of directors, we will endeavor to raise additional equity or sell properties to repay such debt so that we will own
our properties with low to moderate levels of permanent financing. In the event that we are unable to raise additional equity,
our ability to diversify our investments may be diminished. 

In addition, one of our principal liquidity requirements includes
debt service payments and the repayment of maturing debt. As of September 30, 2016, our notes payable were $357.4 million ($353.2
million, net of discount and deferred financing costs). 

We are required by the terms of the applicable loan documents
to meet certain financial covenants, such as debt service coverage ratios, rent coverage ratios and reporting requirements. As
of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements. 

As of September 30, 2016 we had approximately $36.3 million
in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our liquidity will increase from the sale of common stock pursuant to our DRIP Offering,
by reducing the amount of dividends to be paid in cash, if refinancing results in excess loan proceeds, and increased cash flows
from operations. The Company s
liquidity will decrease as funds are expended in connection with real estate investments, including earnouts and promote monetization
payments for the payment of tenant improvements and capital improvements and operating expenses, including interest expense on
any outstanding indebtedness, and if distributions are made in excess of cash from operations. 

Cash flows provided by operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $18.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively. The increase in cash flows
from operations was primarily due to an increase in portfolio net operating income of $5.6 million and the timing of cash
receipts and payments. 

Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $24.0 million and $87.1 million, respectively. The  decrease was due primarily to the
acquisitions of Sumter Grand, Gables of Kentridge and Armbrook Village for $69.3 million in 2015. 

Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $18.9 million and $65.5 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily a
result of activity related to the KKR Equity Commitment and proceeds from and repayments of notes payable for the period
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the period ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company received $18.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Units related to the KKR Equity
Commitment. Additionally, the Company received proceeds from notes payable of $130.8 million related to the Participation
Agreement, refinance activity and draws on debt for The Parkway, the Accel at Golden development, and Gables of Hudson. These
proceeds were offset with $112.1 million of repayments of notes payable related to the Company s refinance activity,
distributions paid to stockholders of $8.7 million and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests of $4.0 million. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company received $36.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Series B
Preferred Units related to the KKR Equity Commitment and received proceeds from notes payable of $43.7 million related to the
acquisitions of Sumter Grand, Gables of Kentridge and Armbrook Village. These proceeds were offset by the distributions paid
to stockholders of $4.0 million and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests of $7.8 million. 

We expect to have sufficient cash available from cash on hand
and operations to fund recurring capital improvements and principal payments due on our borrowings in the next twelve months.
We expect to fund stockholder distributions from cash on hand and from the excess cash provided by operations over required capital
improvements and debt payments. This excess may be insufficient to make distributions at the current level or at all. 

There may be a delay between the generation of cash available
for investment and funding of investments. During this period, proceeds may be temporarily invested in short-term, liquid investments
that could yield lower returns than investments in real estate. 

Potential future sources of capital include proceeds from future
equity offerings, proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties
and undistributed funds from operations. 

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations  

Funds from operations ( FFO ) is a non-GAAP financial
measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition
outlined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as net income
(loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains (or losses) from sales
of property, plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships,
joint ventures, noncontrolling interests and subsidiaries. Our FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do
not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently
than we do. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors and our management as a measure of operating performance because it excludes
depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and extraordinary items, and as a result, when compared
year to year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities,
general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which is not immediately apparent from net income. Historical cost accounting
for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.
Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered
the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient.
As a result, our management believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete
understanding of our performance. Factors that impact FFO include fixed costs, delay in buying assets, lower yields on cash held
in accounts pending investment, income from portfolio properties and other portfolio assets, interest rates on acquisition financing
and operating expenses. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), as an indication of our performance,
nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions, as well as dividend
sustainability. 

Changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP have
prompted a significant increase in the amount of non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO, as defined. Therefore, we use
modified funds from operations ( MFFO ), which excludes from FFO real estate acquisition expenses, and non-cash amounts
related to straight line rent to further evaluate our operating performance. We compute MFFO consistently with the definition
suggested by the Investment Program Association (the  IPA ), the trade association for direct investment programs
(including non-listed REITs). However, certain adjustments included in the IPA s definition are not applicable to us and
are therefore not included in the foregoing definition. 

We believe that MFFO is a helpful measure of operating performance
because it excludes costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities or non-operating changes. Accordingly,
we believe that MFFO can be a useful metric to assist management, investors and analysts in assessing the sustainability of our
operating performance. As explained below, management s evaluation of our operating performance excludes the items considered
in the calculation based on the following considerations: 

Adjustments
    for straight line rents. Under GAAP, rental income recognition can be significantly different than underlying contract terms.
    By adjusting for these items, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the economic impact of our lease terms and
    presents results in a manner more consistent with management s analysis of our operating performance.   

Real estate acquisition
    costs. In evaluating investments in real estate, including both business combinations and investments accounted for under
    the equity method of accounting, management s investment models and analysis differentiate costs to acquire the investment
    from the operations derived from the investment. These acquisition costs have been funded from the proceeds of our initial
    public offering and other financing sources and not from operations. We believe by excluding expensed acquisition costs, MFFO
    provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of our real estate investments and is consistent
    with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Real estate acquisition expenses
    include those paid to our advisor and to third parties.   

Non-recurring gains
    or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt.   

Unrealized gains or
    losses resulting from consolidation to, or deconsolidation from equity accounting.   

Elimination of adjustments relating to contingent purchase price obligations where
    such adjustments have been included in the derivation of GAAP net income.  

FFO or MFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net
income (loss) nor as an indication of our liquidity. Nor is either indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including
our ability to make distributions. Both FFO and MFFO should be reviewed along with other GAAP measurements. Our FFO and MFFO as
presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs. In addition, FFO and MFFO presented for different periods
may not be directly comparable. 

We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of operating performance
because it excludes costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities or non-operating changes. 

Our calculations of FFO and MFFO for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are presented below: 

Distributions Available to Common Stockholders  

Beginning April 1, 2013, our board of directors declared distributions
for daily record dates occurring after April 1, 2013 in amounts per share that, if declared and paid each day for a 365-day period,
would equate to an annualized rate of $0.50 per share (5.00% based on the initial purchase price of our common stock of $10.00). 

The declaration of distributions is at the discretion of our
board of directors and our board will determine the amount of distributions on a regular basis. The amount of distributions will
depend on our funds from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. 

(1)  
      In order to meet the requirements for being treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must pay distributions to our stockholders each taxable year equal to at least 90% of our net ordinary taxable income.   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we declared
distributions, including distributions reinvested, aggregating approximately $4.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively to our
stockholders. The distributions declared in the third quarter of 2016 to be reinvested in the Company s common stock resulted
in 7,284 shares of common stock being issued in October 2016. FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately
$11.1 million and cash flow from operations was approximately $18.6 million. We funded our total distributions paid with cash flows
from operations. For the purposes of determining the source of our distributions paid, we assume first that we use cash flows from
operations from the relevant periods to fund distribution payments. See the reconciliation of FFO to net loss above. 

Item 3.   
       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments.
We invest our cash and cash equivalents in government-backed securities and FDIC-insured savings accounts which, by their nature,
are subject to interest rate fluctuations. However, we believe that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest
rate risk relating the variable portion of our debt financing. As of Septemebr 30, 2016, we had approximately $162.7 million of
variable rate debt, the majority of which is at a rate tied to short-term LIBOR. A 1.0% change in one-Month LIBOR would result
in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $1.6 million per year. Our interest rate risk management objectives are
to monitor and manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. We may use certain derivative financial instruments
such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. We will not enter into
derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 

In addition to changes in interest rates, the fair value of
our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in the real estate capital markets, market rental rates for healthcare
facilities, local, regional and national economic conditions and changes in the credit worthiness of tenants. All of these factors
may also affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.   

Item 4.   
       Controls and Procedures    

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our senior management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
end of the period covered by this report. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply
its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during out most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our

Article
2  - GENERAL MORTGAGE LOAN TERMS 

Section
2.01         Mortgage Loan Origination and Security. 

(a)           Making
of Mortgage Loan. 

Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Lender hereby makes the Mortgage Loan to Borrower, and Borrower
hereby accepts the Mortgage Loan from Lender. Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall: 

(1)          pay
the Indebtedness, including the Prepayment Premium, if any (whether in connection with any voluntary prepayment or in connection
with an acceleration by Lender of the Indebtedness), in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
and 

(2)          perform,
observe, and comply with this Loan Agreement and all other provisions of the other Loan Documents. 

(b)           Security
for Mortgage Loan. 

The Mortgage Loan is
made pursuant to this Loan Agreement, is evidenced by the Note, and is secured by the Security Instrument, this Loan Agreement,
and the other Loan Documents that are expressly stated to be security for the Mortgage Loan. 

(c)          Protective
Advances. 

As provided in the
Security Instrument, Lender may take such actions or disburse such funds as Lender reasonably deems necessary to perform the obligations
of Borrower under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to protect Lender s interest in the Mortgaged Property. 

Section
2.02        Payments on Mortgage Loan. 

(a)          Debt
Service Payments. 

(1)            Short
Month Interest.  

If the date
the Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed is any day other than the first day of the month, interest for the period beginning on
the disbursement date and ending on and including the last day of the month in which the disbursement occurs shall be payable by
Borrower on the date the Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed. In the event that the disbursement date is not the same as the Effective
Date, then: 

(A)          the
disbursement date and the Effective Date must be in the same month, and 

(B)          the
Effective Date shall not be the first day of the month. 

(2)            Interest
Accrual and Computation.  

Except as
provided in Section 2.02(a)(1), interest shall be paid in arrears. Interest shall accrue as provided in the Schedule of Interest
Rate Type Provisions and shall be computed in accordance with the Interest Accrual Method. If the Interest Accrual Method is  Actual/360, 
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the amount allocated to interest for each month will vary depending on the actual number
of calendar days during such month. 

(3)            Monthly
Debt Service Payments.  

Consecutive
monthly debt service installments (comprised of either interest only or principal and interest, depending on the Amortization Type),
each in the amount of the applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment, shall be due and payable on the First Payment Date, and on each
Payment Date thereafter until the Maturity Date, at which time all Indebtedness shall be due. Any regularly scheduled Monthly Debt
Service Payment that is received by Lender before the applicable Payment Date shall be deemed to have been received on such Payment
Date solely for the purpose of calculating interest due. All payments made by Borrower under this Loan Agreement shall be made
without set-off, counterclaim, or other defense. 

(4)            Payment
at Maturity.  

The unpaid
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, any Accrued Interest thereon and all other Indebtedness shall be due and payable on the
Maturity Date. 

(5)            Interest
Rate Type.  

See the Schedule
of Interest Rate Type Provisions for additional provisions, if any, specific to the Interest Rate Type. 

(b)          Capitalization
of Accrued But Unpaid Interest. 

Any accrued and unpaid
interest on the Mortgage Loan remaining past due for thirty (30) days or more may, at Lender s election, be added to and
become part of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan. 

(c)           Late
Charges. 

(1)          If
any Monthly Debt Service Payment due hereunder is not received by Lender within ten (10) days (or fifteen (15) days for any Mortgaged
Property located in Mississippi or North Carolina to comply with applicable law) after the applicable Payment Date, or any amount
payable under this Loan Agreement (other than the payment due on the Maturity Date for repayment of the Mortgage Loan in full)
or any other Loan Document is not received by Lender within ten (10) days (or fifteen (15) days for any Mortgaged Property located
in Mississippi or North Carolina to comply with applicable law) after the date such amount is due, inclusive of the date on which
such amount is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender, immediately without demand by Lender, the Late Charge. 

The Late Charge is payable in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any interest payable at the Default Rate pursuant to Section 2.02(d). 

(2)          Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)          its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Mortgage Loan; 

(B)          it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine those additional expenses; 

(C)          Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional expenses; and 

(D)          the
Late Charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into account all circumstances existing on the date hereof, of the
additional expenses Lender will incur by reason of any such late payment. 

(d)          Default
Rate. 

(1)          Default
interest shall be paid as follows: 

(A)          If
any amount due in respect of the Mortgage Loan (other than amounts due on the Maturity Date) remains past due for thirty (30) days
or more, interest on such unpaid amount(s) shall accrue from the date payment is due at the Default Rate and shall be payable upon
demand by Lender. 

(B)          If
any Indebtedness due is not paid in full on the Maturity Date, then interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on all such unpaid
amounts from the Maturity Date until fully paid and shall be payable upon demand by Lender. 

Absent a demand by Lender, any
such amounts shall be payable by Borrower in the same manner as provided for the payment of Monthly Debt Service Payments. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, interest shall also accrue at the Default Rate on any judgment obtained by Lender against Borrower
in connection with the Mortgage Loan. To the extent Borrower or any other Person is vested with a right of redemption, interest
shall continue to accrue at the Default Rate during any redemption period until such time as the Mortgaged Property has been redeemed. 

(2)          Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)          its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Mortgage Loan; and 

(B)          in
connection with any failure to timely pay all amounts due in respect of the Mortgage Loan on the Maturity Date, or during the time
that any amount due in respect of the Mortgage Loan is delinquent for more than thirty (30) days: 

(i)           Lender s
risk of nonpayment of the Mortgage Loan will be materially increased; 

(ii)          Lender s
ability to meet its other obligations and to take advantage of other investment opportunities will be adversely impacted; 

(iii)         Lender
will incur additional costs and expenses arising from its loss of the use of the amounts due; 

(iv)         it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine such additional costs and expenses; 

(v)          Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional risks, costs, and expenses; and 

(vi)         the
increase from the Interest Rate to the Default Rate represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the additional risks, costs, and
expenses Lender will incur by reason of Borrower s delinquent payment and the additional compensation Lender is entitled
to receive for the increased risks of nonpayment associated with a delinquency on the Mortgage Loan (taking into account all circumstances
existing on the Effective Date). 

(e)          Address
for Payments. 

All payments due pursuant
to the Loan Documents shall be payable at Lender s Payment Address, or such other place and in such manner as may be designated
from time to time by written notice to Borrower by Lender. 

(f)          Application
of Payments. 

If at any time Lender
receives, from Borrower or otherwise, any payment in respect of the Indebtedness that is less than all amounts due and payable
at such time, then Lender may apply such payment to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by Lender
or hold in suspense and not apply such payment at Lender s election. Neither Lender s acceptance of a payment that
is less than all amounts then due and payable, nor Lender s application of, or suspension of the application of, such payment,
shall constitute or be deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding
the application of any such payment to the Indebtedness, Borrower s obligations under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall remain unchanged. 

Section
2.03         Lockout/Prepayment. 

(a)          Prepayment;
Prepayment Lockout; Prepayment Premium. 

(1)          Borrower
shall not make a voluntary full or partial prepayment on the Mortgage Loan during any Prepayment Lockout Period nor shall Borrower
make a voluntary partial prepayment at any time. Except as expressly provided in this Loan Agreement (including as provided in
the Prepayment Premium Schedule), a Prepayment Premium calculated in accordance with the Prepayment Premium Schedule shall be payable
in connection with any prepayment of the Mortgage Loan. 

(2)          If
a Prepayment Lockout Period applies to the Mortgage Loan, and during such Prepayment Lockout Period Lender accelerates the unpaid
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan or otherwise applies collateral held by Lender to the repayment of any portion of the unpaid
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, the Prepayment Premium shall be due and payable and equal to the amount obtained by multiplying
the percentage indicated (if at all) in the Prepayment Premium Schedule by the amount of principal being prepaid at the time of
such acceleration or application. 

(b)          Voluntary
Prepayment in Full. 

At any time after the
expiration of any Prepayment Lockout Period, Borrower may voluntarily prepay the Mortgage Loan in full on a Permitted Prepayment
Date so long as: 

(1)          Borrower
delivers to Lender a Prepayment Notice specifying the Intended Prepayment Date not more than sixty (60) days, but not less than
thirty (30) days (if given via U.S. Postal Service) or twenty (20) days (if given via facsimile, e-mail, or overnight courier)
prior to such Intended Prepayment Date; and 

(2)          Borrower
pays to Lender an amount equal to the sum of: 

(A)          the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; plus 

(B)          all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the prepayment occurs); plus 

(C)          the
Prepayment Premium; plus 

(D)          all
other Indebtedness. 

In connection with any such voluntary prepayment,
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that interest shall always be calculated and paid through the last day of the month in which the
prepayment occurs (even if the Permitted Prepayment Date for such month is not the last day of such month, or if Lender approves
prepayment on an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date). Borrower further acknowledges that Lender is
not required to accept a voluntary prepayment of the Mortgage Loan on any day other than a Permitted Prepayment Date. However,
if Lender does approve an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date and accepts a prepayment on such Intended
Prepayment Date, such prepayment shall be deemed to be received on the immediately following Permitted Prepayment Date. If Borrower
fails to prepay the Mortgage Loan on the Intended Prepayment Date for any reason (including on any Intended Prepayment Date that
is approved by Lender) and such failure either continues for five (5) Business Days, or into the following month, Lender shall
have the right to recalculate the payoff amount. If Borrower prepays the Mortgage Loan either in the following month or more than
five (5) Business Days after the Intended Prepayment Date that was approved by Lender, Lender shall also have the right to recalculate
the payoff amount based upon the amount of such payment and the date such payment was received by Lender. Borrower shall immediately
pay to Lender any additional amounts required by any such recalculation. 

(c)          Acceleration
of Mortgage Loan. 

Upon acceleration of
the Mortgage Loan, Borrower shall pay to Lender: 

(1)          the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; 

(2)          all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the acceleration occurs); 

(3)          the
Prepayment Premium; and 

(4)          all
other Indebtedness. 

(d)          Application
of Collateral. 

Any application by
Lender of any collateral or other security to the repayment of all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan prior to the Maturity Date in accordance with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a prepayment by Borrower. Any such
prepayment shall require the payment to Lender by Borrower of the Prepayment Premium calculated on the amount being prepaid in
accordance with this Loan Agreement. 

(e)          Casualty
and Condemnation. 

Notwithstanding any
provision of this Loan Agreement to the contrary, no Prepayment Premium shall be payable with respect to any prepayment occurring
as a result of the application of any insurance proceeds or amounts received in connection with a Condemnation Action in accordance
with this Loan Agreement. 

(f)           No
Effect on Payment Obligations. 

Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Loan Agreement, any prepayment required by any Loan Document of less than the entire unpaid principal balance
of the Mortgage Loan shall not extend or postpone the due date of any subsequent Monthly Debt Service Payments, Monthly Replacement
Reserve Deposit, or other payment, or change the amount of any such payments or deposits. 

(g)           Loss
Resulting from Prepayment. 

In any circumstance
in which a Prepayment Premium is due under this Loan Agreement, Borrower acknowledges that: 

(1)          any
prepayment of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, whether voluntary or involuntary, or following the occurrence
of an Event of Default by Borrower, will result in Lender s incurring loss, including reinvestment loss, additional risk,
expense, and frustration or impairment of Lender s ability to meet its commitments to third parties; 

(2)          it
is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such losses, risks, and damages; 

(3)          the
formula for calculating the Prepayment Premium represents a reasonable estimate of the losses, risks, and damages Lender will incur
as a result of a prepayment; and 

(4)          the
provisions regarding the Prepayment Premium contained in this Loan Agreement are a material part of the consideration for the Mortgage
Loan, and that the terms of the Mortgage Loan are in other respects more favorable to Borrower as a result of Borrower s
voluntary agreement to such prepayment provisions. 

Article
3  - PERSONAL LIABILITY 

Section
3.01        Non-Recourse Mortgage Loan; Exceptions. 

Except as otherwise
provided in this Article 3 or in any other Loan Document, none of Borrower, or any director, officer, manager, member, partner,
shareholder, trustee, trust beneficiary, or employee of Borrower, shall have personal liability under this Loan Agreement or any
other Loan Document for the repayment of the Indebtedness or for the performance of any other obligations of Borrower under the
Loan Documents, and Lender s only recourse for the satisfaction of such Indebtedness and the performance of such obligations
shall be Lender s exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Mortgaged Property and any other collateral held
by Lender as security for the Indebtedness. This limitation on Borrower s liability shall not limit or impair Lender s
enforcement of its rights against Guarantor under any Loan Document. 

Section
3.02        Personal Liability of Borrower (Exceptions to Non-Recourse Provision). 

(a)          Personal
Liability Based on Lender s Loss. 

Borrower shall be personally
liable to Lender for the repayment of the portion of the Indebtedness equal to any loss or damage suffered by Lender as a result
of, subject to any notice and cure period, if any: 

(1)          failure
to pay as directed by Lender upon demand after an Event of Default (to the extent actually received by Borrower or Affiliated Property
Operator): 

(A)          all
Rents to which Lender is entitled under the Loan Documents; and 

(B)          the
amount of all security deposits then held or thereafter collected from tenants and not properly applied pursuant to the applicable
Leases; 

(2)          failure
to maintain all insurance policies required by the Loan Documents, except to the extent Lender has the obligation to pay the premiums
pursuant to Section 12.03(c); 

(3)          failure
to apply all insurance proceeds received by Borrower or Affiliated Property Operator or any amounts received by Borrower or Affiliated
Property Operator in connection with a Condemnation Action, as required by the Loan Documents; 

(4)          failure
to comply with any provision of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document relating to the delivery of books and records, statements,
schedules, and reports; 

(5)          except
to the extent directed otherwise by Lender pursuant to Section 3.02(a)(1), failure to apply Rents to the ordinary and necessary
expenses of owning or operating, as applicable, the Mortgaged Property and Debt Service Amounts, as and when each is due and payable,
except that Borrower will not be personally liable with respect to Rents that are distributed by Borrower in any calendar year
if Borrower has paid all ordinary and necessary expenses of owning or operating, as applicable, the Mortgaged Property and Debt
Service Amounts for such calendar year; 

(6)          waste
or abandonment of the Mortgaged Property; 

(7)          grossly
negligent or reckless unintentional material misrepresentation or omission by Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor,
Key Principal, or any officer, director, partner, manager, member, shareholder, or trustee of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator,
Guarantor, or Key Principal in connection with on-going financial or other reporting required by the Loan Documents, or any request
for action or consent by Lender; 

(8)          failure
to cause the renewal, continuation, extension, or maintenance of all Licenses or, if any Licenses are to be transferred to a transferee
approved by Lender, failure to cause such Licenses to be transferred or reissued within the period of time required under applicable
law and to provide to Lender written notice of such transfer including copies of the newly issued Licenses; or 

(9)          revocation
or termination without Lender s consent of the standing instructions from Borrower or Property Operator to the depositary
bank pursuant to any Depositary Agreement. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower
shall not have personal liability under clauses (1), (3), or (5) above to the extent that Borrower lacks the legal right to direct

Authorization. 

(1)          The
execution, delivery, and performance by Borrower of this Loan Agreement, the Facility Operating Agreement, and the other Loan Documents
have been duly authorized by all necessary action and proceedings by or on behalf of Borrower, and no further approvals or filings

condition to the valid execution, delivery, and performance by Borrower of this Loan Agreement, the Facility Operating Agreement,
or any of the other Loan Documents, except filings required to perfect and maintain the liens to be granted under the Loan Documents

obligations under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower did not receive less than reasonably equivalent value
in exchange for the incurrence of the obligations of Borrower under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Affiliated
Property Operator has sufficient working capital, including cash flow from the Mortgaged Property, or other resources, not only
to maintain the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the terms of the Facility Operating Agreement, but also to pay the rents

as a Seniors Housing Facility, (B) shall maintain, or shall cause Property Operator, if applicable, to maintain, in good standing
all Licenses, (C) shall renew or extend, or shall cause Property Operator, if applicable, to renew and extend, all such required

(g)           Medicaid
Provider Agreement. 

(1)          (1)         If
neither Borrower nor any Property Operator is a Medicaid Participant as of the Effective Date, Borrower shall notify Lender in
writing thirty (30) days prior to Borrower s or any Property Operator s (with respect to the Mortgaged Property) submission
of its request to enter into a Medicaid Provider Agreement, and will provide Lender with copies of all correspondence and documentation

execute the form of Medicaid reserve agreement and Depositary Agreement as Lender may require. 

(2)          The
following provisions apply if a Medicaid Provider Agreement is in place as of the Effective Date or entered into at any time during
the Term of the Mortgage Loan:

effective gross income to be derived from funds paid to Borrower or Property Operator by a Governmental Authority or a Managed
Care Organization, as applicable, under a Medicaid Provider Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower or any Property
Operator is a Medicaid Participant with respect to the Mortgaged Property, and if by reason of applicable law or regulation more
than twenty percent (20%) of effective gross income is derived from funds paid to such Borrower or Property Operator by a Governmental
Authority or a Managed Care Organization, Borrower and Property Operator shall take in a diligent and expeditious manner all reasonable
steps necessary to comply with the preceding sentence to the extent permissible by applicable law or regulation;

of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates that: 

(i)           either
Borrower or any Property Operator is in default under the terms of the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(ii)          the
applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization intends to amend, modify, or terminate the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(iii)         Borrower
or Property Operator has ceased to meet the provider standards required by the applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care
Organization;

or Property Operator has received notice from any Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization that the rates for services
provided under the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement will be adjusted; or 

(v)          either
Borrower or any Property Operator has been excluded from participation in any Governmental Health Care Program with respect to
the Mortgaged Property or any other property. 

(h)           Facility
Operating Agreement. 

(1)          The
provisions of this Section 6.02(h)(1) apply to all Facility Operating Agreements other than a Seniors Housing Facility Lease and
to all Property Operators other than a Property Operator under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower shall comply with and
shall enforce the obligations of each Property Operator under each Facility Operating Agreement. Without the prior written consent
of Lender, Borrower shall not:

amend, supplement, or restate any Facility Operating Agreement; 

(B)          waive
a default under any Facility Operating Agreement; 

(C)          waive
any of Borrower s rights or fail to diligently pursue Borrower s remedies under the Facility Operating Agreement; 

(D)          add
or release a property to or from any Facility Operating Agreement; or 

(E)          violate
the provisions of Section 11.02(c). 

(2)          Within
five (5) days of Borrower s receipt or delivery (or any Property Operator s receipt), Borrower shall provide Lender
written notice of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates either Borrower or any
Property Operator is (A) in default under the terms of any Facility Operating Agreement, (B) amending, modifying, or terminating
any Facility Operating Agreement, or (C) otherwise discontinuing its operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(3)          After
Borrower receives notice (or otherwise has actual knowledge) of an Event of Default under the Loan Documents, it will not make
any payment of fees under or pursuant to the Facility Operating Agreement without Lender s prior written consent. 

(4)          Borrower
shall cause each Property Operator, where applicable, to comply with the terms, conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative
and negative covenants of this Loan Agreement relating to the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property, including all terms,
conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants set forth in this Loan Agreement applicable to the
organization, existence, and good standing of Property Operator necessary for the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property. 

(i)           Change
in Property Operator. 

Each Property Operator
and each Facility Operating Agreement must be approved in writing in advance by Lender. Borrower shall not remove or permit or
suffer the removal of any Property Operator without the prior written consent of Lender and unless and until Lender has approved
in writing a replacement Property Operator. Each Facility Operating Agreement or other similar agreement between Borrower and a
new Property Operator must be approved in writing in advance by Lender, and Borrower and the new Property Operator must execute
and deliver to Lender a SASA in form required by Lender, subject to the provisions of Section 6.03(a). Borrower shall notify Lender
in writing of any name change of an Affiliated Property Operator or any change in an Affiliated Property Operator s place
of incorporation or organization. Borrower agrees that Lender shall have the right to remove any Property Operator at any time
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, subject to the provisions of the SASA. 

(j)           Contracts. 

Borrower may in the
future enter into Contracts for the provision of additional goods or services at or otherwise in connection with the operation,
use, or management of the Mortgaged Property. Borrower absolutely and unconditionally pledges, grants a security interest in, and
assigns to Lender all of Borrower s right, title, and interest in, to, and under the Contracts, including Borrower s
right, power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Until Lender gives notice to Borrower
of Lender s exercise of its rights under this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall have all right, power, and authority granted
to Borrower under any Contract (except as otherwise limited by this subsection or any other provision of this Loan Agreement),
including the right, power, and authority to modify the terms of any Contract or extend or terminate any Contract. If an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, and at the option of Lender, the permission given to Borrower pursuant to the preceding
sentence to exercise all right, power, and authority under Contracts shall terminate. Upon Lender s delivery of notice to
Borrower of an Event of Default, Lender shall immediately have all right, power, and authority granted to Borrower under any Contract,
including the right, power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Borrower shall fully
perform all of its obligations under the Contracts, and Borrower agrees not to assign, sell, pledge, transfer, mortgage, or otherwise
encumber its interests in any of the Contracts without the prior written approval of Lender. Each Contract entered into by Borrower
subsequent to the date hereof, the average annual consideration of which, directly or indirectly, is at least $50,000, shall provide:
(A) that it shall be terminable for cause, and (B) that it shall be terminable, at Lender s option, upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default. 

(k)          All
Representations and Covenants Deemed Borrower Responsibility. 

(1)          Any
act, action, term, condition, provision, requirement, or covenant required to be performed, or prohibited from being performed,
by Borrower under the Loan Documents including with respect to 

(A)          the
use, management or operation of the Mortgaged Property, including any licensing, repair, reporting, or insurance requirements,
and 

(B)          the
organization, existence, good standing or other entity-level requirements, shall be interpreted as requiring Borrower either to
perform such act or action directly or to cause Property Operator, a property manager or other appropriate agent to perform such
act or action. Any right or privilege assigned or delegated by Borrower or Property Operator to any other Person shall be construed
as being accompanied by each relevant obligation or restriction set forth in the Loan Documents or any Facility Operating Agreement,
as applicable. 

(C)          In
each instance that Borrower makes, or in the future renews or is deemed to renew, a representation, warranty, or covenant in this
Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents regarding the condition, knowledge, acts, or omissions of Property Operator or any Property
Operator Business Information, or the condition of the Mortgaged Property, Borrower does and shall do so with full knowledge, after
due inquiry (including the due inquiry of and by Guarantor), of such information. Any reporting or compliance delay caused by Property
Operator or Guarantor shall not excuse Borrower s timely performance of the terms of this Loan Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower s reliance upon incorrect or incomplete information received from
Property Operator or Guarantor and the reporting of the same to Lender, whether or not Borrower had actual knowledge that such
information was incorrect or incomplete and whether or not Borrower is otherwise in violation of the terms of this Loan Agreement,
shall not be (and none of Borrower, Property Operator, Guarantor, nor Key Principal shall assert) a defense to Lender s determination
that an Event of Default has occurred or that Borrower (or Guarantor) has incurred personal liability as set forth in Article 3
of this Loan Agreement. 

Section
6.03         Mortgage Loan Administration Matters Regarding the Property. 

(a)           Property
Management. 

If, in connection with
the making of the Mortgage Loan, or at any later date, Lender waives in writing the requirement for a written contract for the
operation or management of the Mortgaged Property, and Borrower later elects to enter into a written contract or change the operation
or management of the Mortgaged Property, such new Property Operator and any Facility Operating Agreement must be approved by Lender.
As a condition to any approval by Lender, Borrower and such new Property Operator shall enter into a SASA. 

(b)           Subordination
of Fees by Property Operator. 

All fees due to an
Affiliated Property Operator in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in
right to the prior payment in full of the Indebtedness. All fees due to a non-Affiliated Property Operator in connection with the
operation and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of monthly
debt service and funding of escrows and reserves as required under the Mortgage Loan Documents, and the payment of all operating
expenses and capital expenditures incurred in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(c)           Property
Condition Assessment. 

If, in connection with
any inspection of the Mortgaged Property, Lender determines that the condition of the Mortgaged Property has deteriorated (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) since the Effective Date, Lender may obtain, at Borrower s expense, a property condition assessment
of the Mortgaged Property. Lender s right to obtain a property condition assessment pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) shall
be in addition to any other rights available to Lender under this Loan Agreement in connection with any such deterioration. Any
such inspection or property condition assessment may result in Lender requiring Additional Lender Repairs or Additional Lender
Replacements as further described in Section 13.02(a)(9)(B). 

Article
7  - LEASES AND RENTS 

Section
7.01        Representations and Warranties. 

The representations
and warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 7.01 are made as of the Effective Date and are true and correct except
as disclosed on the Exceptions to Representations and Warranties Schedule. 

(a)           Prior
Assignment of Rents. 

Borrower has not executed
any: 

(1)          prior
assignment of Rents (other than an assignment of Rents securing prior indebtedness that has been paid off and discharged or will
be paid off and discharged with the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan); or 

(2)          instrument
which would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument, or the SASA. 

(b)           Prepaid
Rents. 

Borrower has not accepted,
and does not expect to receive prepayment of, any Rents for one (1) month for the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or more than two
(2) months under any other Lease prior to the due dates of such Rents. 

(c)           Seniors
Housing Facility Lease. 

(1)          The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease is in full force and effect and there is neither a default thereunder nor any condition that, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder. No right or claim of rescission, offset,
abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim has been asserted with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease, and there
is no existing condition that, with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would result in a right or claim of rescission,
offset, abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim under the terms and provisions of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower
has performed and discharged all of the obligations on the part of Borrower to be performed and discharged pursuant to the terms
set forth in the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. 

(2)          The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has not been modified, amended or supplemented by either party thereto. The Property Operator has
not been released, in whole or in part, from any of its obligations under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. There has been no
prior sale, transfer, assignment, hypothecation, or pledge of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease (other than in connection with
the Loan Documents) that is outstanding. 

(3)          The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has an original term ending on or after the date ninety (90) days after the Maturity Date. Absent
Lender s direction, the Property Operator cannot terminate the Seniors Housing Facility Lease for any reason prior to the
payment in full of the Indebtedness. 

(4)          There
is no free rent, partial rent or rebate of rent required to be given by Borrower to Property Operator under the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease. The Seniors Housing Facility Lease does not permit Property Operator to accept, and Property Operator has not accepted,
prepayment of Rents more than two (2) months in advance (and Borrower has not accepted prepayment of Rents more than one (1) month
in advance with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease). Each payment due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease is sufficient
to pay the Debt Service Amounts (including Monthly Debt Service Payments, Taxes, Impositions, and any Replacement Reserve Deposits)
in full on or prior to the due date thereof (without giving effect to any applicable grace periods) currently and throughout the
term of the Mortgage Loan. Payments due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease are payable without notice or demand, and without
setoff, recoupment, abatement, or reduction. 

(5)          Property
Operator has no right or option pursuant to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any part of the
Mortgaged Property, the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises are a part. 

(6)          The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease contains customary and enforceable provisions that render the rights and remedies of Borrower adequate
for the enforcement and satisfaction of the Borrower s rights thereunder. 

(7)          Borrower
represents and warrants that it is the express intent of Borrower and Property Operator that the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
constitute a lease under applicable real property laws and laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency, and creditors  rights generally,
and that the sole interest of Property Operator in the Mortgaged Property is as a tenant under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease.
The Seniors Housing Facility Lease is not intended to be deemed a guaranty. 

Section
7.02         Covenants. 

(a)           Leases. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)          comply
with and observe all landlord obligations under all Leases, including landlord s obligations pertaining to the maintenance
and disposition of any tenant security deposits or any other refundable fees including entrance fees or community fees; 

(2)          surrender
possession of the Mortgaged Property, including all Leases and all security deposits and prepaid Rents, immediately upon appointment
of a receiver or Lender s entry upon and taking of possession and control of the Mortgaged Property, as applicable; 

(3)          require
that all Residential Leases have initial lease terms of not less than six (6) months and not more than twenty-four (24) months
(however, if customary in the applicable market for properties comparable to the Mortgaged Property, Residential Leases with terms
of less than six (6) months (but in no case less than one (1) month) may be permitted with Lender s prior written consent;
provided further, where required by Applicable Law, Residential Leases with terms of less than six (6) months (but in no case less
than one (1) month) shall be permitted without Lender s consent so long as Borrower promptly notifies Lender of such requirement);
and 

(4)          promptly
provide Lender a copy of any non-Residential Lease at the time such Lease is executed (subject to Lender s consent rights
for Material Commercial Leases in Section 7.02(b) and subject to Lender s consent rights for the Seniors Housing Facility
Lease pursuant to Section 6.02(i) and the SASA), and, upon Lender s written request, promptly provide Lender a copy of any
Residential Lease then in effect. 

(b)           Commercial
Leases. 

(1)          With
respect to Material Commercial Leases, Borrower shall not: 

(A)          enter
into any Material Commercial Lease except with the prior written consent of Lender; or

the terms of, extend, or terminate any Material Commercial Lease (including any Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective
Date) without the prior written consent of Lender. 

(2)          With
respect to any non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall not: 

(A)          enter
into any non-Material Commercial Lease that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to the Lease
in effect as of the Effective Date or reduces the number or size of residential units at the Mortgaged Property; or 

(B)          modify
the terms of any non-Material Commercial Lease (including any non-Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective Date)
in any way that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to such non-Material Commercial Lease in
effect as of the Effective Date, reduces the number or size of residential units at the Mortgaged Property, or results in such
non-Material Commercial Lease being deemed a Material Commercial Lease.

evidence, in form and content acceptable to Lender, that each required insurance policy under this Article 9 has been renewed not
less than fifteen (15) days prior to the applicable expiration date, and (if such evidence is other than an original or duplicate

Section
9.03        Mortgage Loan Administration Matters Regarding Insurance 

(a)          Lender s
Ongoing Insurance Requirements. 

Borrower acknowledges
that Lender s insurance requirements may change from time to time. All insurance policies and renewals of insurance policies
required by this Loan Agreement shall be: 

(1)          in
the form and with the terms required by Lender; 

(2)          in
such amounts, with such maximum deductibles and for such periods required by Lender; and 

(3)          issued
by insurance companies satisfactory to Lender. 

BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT ANY FAILURE OF BORROWER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9.02(a) OR SECTION 9.02(b)(3) ABOVE SHALL PERMIT
LENDER TO PURCHASE THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE AT BORROWER S COST. SUCH INSURANCE MAY, BUT NEED NOT, PROTECT BORROWER S
INTERESTS. THE COVERAGE THAT LENDER PURCHASES MAY NOT PAY ANY CLAIM THAT BORROWER MAKES OR ANY CLAIM THAT IS MADE AGAINST BORROWER
IN CONNECTION WITH THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY. IF LENDER PURCHASES INSURANCE FOR THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY AS PERMITTED HEREUNDER, BORROWER
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS OF THAT INSURANCE, INCLUDING INTEREST AT THE DEFAULT RATE AND ANY OTHER CHARGES LENDER MAY IMPOSE
IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE INSURANCE UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CANCELLATION OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE INSURANCE.
THE COSTS OF THE INSURANCE SHALL BE ADDED TO BORROWER S TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OR OBLIGATION AND SHALL CONSTITUTE ADDITIONAL
INDEBTEDNESS. THE COSTS OF THE INSURANCE MAY BE MORE THAN THE COST OF INSURANCE BORROWER MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ITS OWN. BORROWER
MAY LATER CANCEL ANY INSURANCE PURCHASED BY LENDER, BUT ONLY AFTER PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT BORROWER HAS OBTAINED INSURANCE AS REQUIRED
BY THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. 

(b)          Application
of Proceeds on Event of Loss. 

(1)          Upon
an event of loss, Lender may, at Lender s option: 

(A)          hold
such proceeds to be applied to reimburse Borrower for the cost of Restoration (in accordance with Lender s then-current policies
relating to the restoration of casualty damage on similar multifamily residential properties); or 

(B)          apply
such proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness, whether or not then due;  provided ,  however , Lender shall not apply
insurance proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness and shall permit Restoration pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(1)(A) if all of
the following conditions are met: 

(i)           no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or any event which, with the giving of written notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); 

(ii)          Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(iii)         Lender
determines that the net operating income generated by the Mortgaged Property after completion of the Restoration will be sufficient
to support a debt service coverage ratio not less than the debt service coverage ratio immediately prior to the event of loss,
but in no event less than 1.0x (the debt service coverage ratio shall be calculated on a thirty (30) year amortizing basis (if
applicable, on a   proforma   basis approved by Lender) in all events and shall include payments due from any Operator
under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease and all operating costs and other expenses, Imposition Deposits, deposits to Collateral
Accounts, and Mortgage Loan repayment obligations); 

(iv)         Lender
determines that the Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (1) one year before the stated Maturity Date, or (2) one
year after the date of the loss or casualty; and 

(v)          Borrower
provides Lender, upon written request, evidence of the availability during and after the Restoration of the insurance required
to be maintained pursuant to this Loan Agreement. 

After the completion of Restoration
in accordance with the above requirements, as determined by Lender, the balance, if any, of such proceeds shall be returned to
Borrower. 

(2)          Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any loss is estimated to be in an amount equal to or less than $50,000, Lender shall not exercise its rights
and remedies as power-of-attorney herein and shall allow Borrower to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any claims under
policies of property damage insurance, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such policies of property damage insurance,
and to collect and receive the proceeds of property damage insurance; provided that each of the following conditions shall be satisfied: 

(A)          Borrower
shall immediately notify Lender of the casualty giving rise to the claim; 

(B)          no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or any event which, with the giving of written notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); 

(C)          the
Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (i) one year before the stated Maturity Date or (ii) one year after the date
of the loss or casualty; 

(D)          Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(E)          all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be issued in the form of joint checks to Borrower and Lender; 

(F)          all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be applied to the Restoration; 

(G)          Borrower
shall deliver to Lender evidence satisfactory to Lender of completion of the Restoration and obtainment of all lien releases; 

(H)          Borrower
shall have complied to Lender s satisfaction with the foregoing requirements on any prior claims subject to this provision,
if any; and 

(I)          Lender
shall have the right to inspect the Mortgaged Property (subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases, other than the Seniors
Housing Facility Lease). 

(3)          If
Lender elects to apply insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall
not be obligated to restore or repair the Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to the damaged portion of
the Mortgaged Property and, at its expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by insurance, clean up any debris resulting
from the casualty event, and, if required or otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining part of the damaged
Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable, and marketable condition.
Nothing in this Section 9.03(b) shall affect any of Lender s remedial rights against Borrower in connection with a breach
by Borrower of any of its obligations under this Loan Agreement or under any Loan Document, including any failure to timely pay
Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain the insurance coverage(s) required by this Loan Agreement. 

(c)           Payment
Obligations Unaffected. 

The application of
any insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness shall not extend or postpone the Maturity Date, or the due date or the full payment
of any Monthly Debt Service Payment, Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, or any other installments referred to in this Loan Agreement
or in any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lender applies insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in connection
with a casualty of less than the entire Mortgaged Property, and after such application of proceeds the debt service coverage ratio
(as determined by Lender) is less than 1.25x based on the then-applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment and the anticipated on-going
net operating income of the Mortgaged Property after such casualty event, then Lender may, at its discretion, permit an adjustment
to the Monthly Debt Service Payments that become due and owing thereafter, based on Lender s then-current underwriting requirements.
In no event shall the preceding sentence obligate Lender to make any adjustment to the Monthly Debt Service Payments. 

(d)           Foreclosure
Sale. 

If the Mortgaged Property
is transferred pursuant to a Foreclosure Event or Lender otherwise acquires title to the Mortgaged Property, Borrower acknowledges
that Lender shall automatically succeed to all rights of Borrower in and to any insurance policies and unearned insurance premiums
applicable to the Mortgaged Property and in and to the proceeds resulting from any damage to the Mortgaged Property prior to such
Foreclosure Event or such acquisition. 

(e)           Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby authorizes
and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c).

(c)           Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact.

and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c). 

(d)           Preservation
of Mortgaged Property. 

If a Condemnation Action
results in or from damage to the Mortgaged Property and Lender elects to apply the proceeds or awards from such Condemnation Action
to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall not be obligated to restore or repair the
Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to any portion of the Mortgaged Property which has been damaged or destroyed
in connection with such Condemnation Action and, at Borrower s expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by
insurance, clean up any debris resulting in or from the Condemnation Action, and, if required by any Governmental Authority or
otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining part of the damaged Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to
keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable, and marketable condition. Nothing in this Section 10.03(d) shall
affect any of Lender s remedial rights against Borrower in connection with a breach by Borrower of any of its obligations
under this Loan Agreement or under any Loan Document, including any failure to timely pay Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain
the insurance coverage(s) required by this Loan Agreement.

of Taxes, Assessments, and Other Charges.

(1)          paid
(or with the approval of Lender, established an escrow fund sufficient to pay when due and payable) all amounts and charges relating

including Impositions, leasehold payments, and ground rents;

all Taxes for the Mortgaged Property that have become due before any fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto

fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto; 

(3)          no
knowledge of any basis for any additional assessments; 

(4)          no
knowledge of any presently pending special assessments against all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, or any presently pending
special assessments against Borrower; and 

(5)          not
received any written notice of any contemplated special assessment against the Mortgaged Property, or any contemplated special
assessment against Borrower. 

Section
12.02      Covenants. 

(a)           Imposition
Deposits, Taxes, and Other Charges. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)          deposit
the Imposition Deposits with Lender on each Payment Date (or on another day designated in writing by Lender) in amount sufficient,
in Lender s discretion, to enable Lender to pay each Imposition before the last date upon which such payment may be made
without any penalty or interest charge being added, plus an amount equal to no more than one-sixth (1/6) (or the amount permitted
by applicable law) of the Impositions for the trailing twelve (12) months (calculated based on the aggregate annual Imposition
costs divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by two (2)); 

(2)          deposit
with Lender, within ten (10) days after written notice from Lender (subject to applicable law), such additional amounts estimated
by Lender to be reasonably necessary to cure any deficiency in the amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment of a specific
Imposition; 

(3)          except
as set forth in Section 12.03(c) below, pay all Impositions, leasehold payments, ground rents, and Taxes when due and before any
fine, penalty, interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto; 

(4)          promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all notices of, and invoices for, Impositions, and, if Borrower pays any Imposition directly, Borrower
shall promptly furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payments; and 

(5)          promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all notices of any special assessments and contemplated special assessments against the Mortgaged Property
or Borrower. 

Section
12.03      Mortgage Loan Administration Matters Regarding Impositions. 

(a)           Maintenance
of Records by Lender. 

Lender shall maintain
records of the monthly and aggregate Imposition Deposits held by Lender for the purpose of paying Taxes, insurance premiums, and
each other obligation of Borrower for which Imposition Deposits are required. 

(b)           Imposition
Accounts. 

All Imposition Deposits
shall be held in an institution (which may be Lender, if Lender is such an institution) whose deposits or accounts are insured
or guaranteed by a federal agency and which accounts meet the standards for custodial accounts as required by Lender from time
to time. Lender shall not be obligated to open additional accounts, or deposit Imposition Deposits in additional institutions,
when the amount of the Imposition Deposits exceeds the maximum amount of the federal deposit insurance or guaranty. No interest,
earnings, or profits on the Imposition Deposits shall be paid to Borrower unless applicable law so requires. Imposition Deposits
shall not be trust funds, nor shall they operate to reduce the Indebtedness, unless applied by Lender for that purpose in accordance
with this Loan Agreement. For the purposes of 9-104(a)(3) of the UCC, Lender is the owner of the Imposition Deposits and shall
be deemed a  customer  with sole control of the account holding the Imposition Deposits. 

(c)           Payment
of Impositions; Sufficiency of Imposition Deposits. 

Lender may pay an Imposition
according to any bill, statement, or estimate from the appropriate public office or insurance company without inquiring into the
accuracy of the bill, statement, or estimate or into the validity of the Imposition. Imposition Deposits shall be required to be
used by Lender to pay Taxes, insurance premiums and any other individual Imposition only if: 

(1)          no
Event of Default exists; 

(2)          Borrower
has timely delivered to Lender all applicable bills or premium notices that it has received; and 

(3)          sufficient
Imposition Deposits are held by Lender for each Imposition at the time such Imposition becomes due and payable. 

Lender shall have no
liability to Borrower or any other Person for failing to pay any Imposition if any of the conditions are not satisfied. If at any
time the amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment of a specific Imposition exceeds the amount reasonably deemed necessary
by Lender to be held in connection with such Imposition, the excess may be credited against future installments of Imposition Deposits
for such Imposition. 

(d)           Imposition
Deposits Upon Event of Default. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Lender may apply any Imposition Deposits, in such amount and in such order as Lender determines,
to pay any Impositions or as a credit against the Indebtedness. 

(e)           Contesting
Impositions. 

Other than insurance
premiums, Borrower may contest, at its expense, by appropriate legal proceedings, the amount or validity of any Imposition if: 

(1)          Borrower
notifies Lender of the commencement or expected commencement of such proceedings; 

(2)          Lender
determines that the Mortgaged Property is not in danger of being sold or forfeited; 

(3)          Borrower
deposits with Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority if required by applicable law) reserves sufficient to pay the contested
Imposition, if required by Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority); 

(4)          Borrower
furnishes whatever additional security is required in the proceedings or is reasonably requested in writing by Lender; and 

(5)          Borrower
commences, and at all times thereafter diligently prosecutes, such contest in good faith until a final determination is made by
the applicable Governmental Authority. 

(f)           Release
to Borrower. 

Upon payment in full
of all sums secured by the Security Instrument and this Loan Agreement and release by Lender of the lien of the Security Instrument,
Lender shall disburse to Borrower the balance of any Imposition Deposits then on deposit with Lender.

(d)           Assignment
of Contracts for Replacements and Repairs.

assign to Lender as additional security any contract or subcontract for Replacements or Repairs, upon Lender s written request,
on a form of assignment approved by Lender. 

(e)           Indemnification. 

If Lender elects to
exercise its rights under Section 14.03 due to Borrower s failure to timely commence or complete any Replacements or Repairs,
Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender harmless for, from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities,
losses, damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, arising from
or in any way connected with the performance by Lender of the Replacements or Repairs or investment of the Reserve/Escrow Account
Funds; provided that Borrower shall have no indemnity obligation if such actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses,
damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, arise as a result
of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Lender, Lender s agents, employees, or representatives as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

(f)           Amendments
to Loan Documents. 

Subject to Section
5.02, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender, upon written request, an amendment to this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument,
and any other Loan Document deemed necessary or desirable to perfect Lender s lien upon any portion of the Mortgaged Property
for which Reserve/Escrow Account Funds were expended. 

(g)          Administrative
Fees and Expenses. 

Borrower shall pay

(2)          upon
demand, a reasonable inspection fee, not exceeding the Maximum Inspection Fee, for each inspection of the Mortgaged Property by
Lender in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such
inspections; and 

(3)          upon
demand, all reasonable fees charged by any engineer, architect, inspector or other person inspecting the Mortgaged Property on
behalf of Lender for each inspection of the Mortgaged Property in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable
costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such inspections. 

Section
13.02      Mortgage Loan Administration Matters Regarding Reserves. 

(a)           Accounts,
Deposits, and Disbursements. 

(1)            Custodial
Accounts.  

(A)          The
Replacement Reserve Account shall be an interest-bearing account that meets the standards for custodial accounts as required by
Lender from time to time. Lender shall not be responsible for any losses resulting from the investment of the Replacement Reserve
Deposits or for obtaining any specific level or percentage of earnings on such investment. All interest, if any, earned on the
Replacement Reserve Deposits shall be added to and become part of the Replacement Reserve Account;  provided ,  however ,
if applicable law requires, and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents,
Lender shall pay to Borrower the interest earned on the Replacement Reserve Account not less frequently than the Replacement Reserve
Account Interest Disbursement Frequency. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the Reserve/Escrow Account
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

(B)          Lender
shall not be obligated to deposit the Repairs Escrow Deposits into an interest-bearing account. 

(2)            Disbursements
by Lender Only.  

Only Lender
or a designated representative of Lender may make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account and the Repairs Escrow Account.
Except as provided in Section 13.02(a)(8), disbursements shall only be made upon Borrower request and after satisfaction of all
conditions for disbursement. 

(3)            Adjustment
to Deposits.  

(A)           Mortgage
Loan Terms Exceeding Ten (10) Years.  

If the Loan
Term exceeds ten (10) years (or five (5) years in the case of any Mortgaged Property that is an  affordable housing property 
as indicated on the Summary of Loan Terms), a property condition assessment shall be ordered by Lender for the Mortgaged Property
at the expense of Borrower (which expense may be paid out of the Replacement Reserve Account if excess funds are available). The
property condition assessment shall be performed no earlier than the sixth (6th) month and no later than the ninth (9th) month
of the tenth (10th) Loan Year and every tenth (10th) Loan Year thereafter if the Loan Term exceeds twenty (20) years (or the fifth
(5th) Loan Year in the case of any Mortgaged Property that is an  affordable housing property  as indicated on the
Summary of Loan Terms and every fifth (5th) Loan Year thereafter if the Loan Term exceeds ten (10) years). After review of the
property condition assessment, the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit may be adjusted by Lender for the remaining
Loan Term by written notice to Borrower so that the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposits are sufficient to fund the Replacements
as and when required and/or the amount to be held in the Repairs Escrow Account may be adjusted by Lender so that the Repairs Escrow
Deposit is sufficient to fund the Repairs as and when required. 

(B)           Transfers.  

In connection
with any Transfer of the Mortgaged Property, the Facility Operating Agreement, or any Transfer of an ownership interest in Borrower,
Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal that requires Lender s consent, Lender may review the amounts on
deposit, if any, in the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve
Deposit and the likely repairs and replacements required by the Mortgaged Property, and the related contingencies which may arise

requests may only be made after completion of the applicable Repairs and only to reimburse Borrower for the actual cost of the
Repairs, up to the Maximum Repair Cost. Lender shall not disburse any amounts which would cause the funds remaining in the Repairs
Escrow Account after any disbursement (other than with respect to the final disbursement) to be less than the Maximum Repair Cost
of the then-current estimated cost of completing all remaining Repairs. Lender shall not disburse from the Repairs Escrow Account
the costs of routine maintenance to the Mortgaged Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from the Replacement Reserve

Lender may
require, as set forth in Section 6.02(b), Section 6.03(c), or otherwise from time to time, upon written notice to Borrower, that

an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or as otherwise provided in Section 14.03(c). 

(c)           Delays
and Workmanship. 

If any work for any

or making of such Replacements or Repairs, Lender shall have the right to enter onto the Mortgaged Property and perform any and
all work and labor necessary to make or complete the Replacements or Repairs and employ watchmen to protect the Mortgaged Property
from damage. All funds so expended by Lender shall be deemed to have been advanced to Borrower, shall be part of the Indebtedness
and shall be secured by the Security Instrument and this Loan Agreement.

of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact.

Replacement or Repair in a manner satisfactory to Lender shall not be deemed an acknowledgment or warranty to any Person that the
Replacement or Repair has been completed in accordance with applicable building, zoning, or other codes, ordinances, statutes,
laws, regulations, or requirements of any Governmental Authority, such responsibility being at all times exclusively that of Borrower.

(1)          any
failure by Borrower to perform any of its obligations under this Loan Agreement or any Loan Document (other than those specified

Section
14.02      Remedies. 

(a)           Acceleration;
Foreclosure. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, any Accrued Interest, interest accruing
at the Default Rate, the Prepayment Premium (if applicable), and all other Indebtedness, at the option of Lender, shall immediately
become due and payable, without any prior written notice to Borrower, unless applicable law requires otherwise (and in such case,
after any required written notice has been given). Lender may exercise this option to accelerate regardless of any prior forbearance.
In addition, Lender shall have all rights and remedies afforded to Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, including,
foreclosure on and/or the power of sale of the Mortgaged Property, as provided in the Security Instrument, and any rights and remedies
available to Lender at law or in equity (subject to Borrower s statutory rights of reinstatement, if any). Any proceeds of
a Foreclosure Event may be held and applied by Lender as additional collateral for the Indebtedness pursuant to this Loan Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event shall automatically accelerate the Mortgage Loan and all
obligations and Indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable without written notice or further action by Lender. 

(b)           Loss
of Right to Disbursements from Collateral Accounts. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall immediately lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve/Escrow
Accounts and any Collateral Accounts. During the continuance of any such Event of Default, Lender may use the Reserve/Escrow Account
Funds and any Collateral Account Funds (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including: 

(1)          repayment
of the Indebtedness, including principal prepayments and the Prepayment Premium applicable to such full or partial prepayment,
as applicable (however, such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default); 

(2)          reimbursement
of Lender for all losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event
of Default; 

(3)          completion
of the Replacement or Repair or for any other replacement or repair to the Mortgaged Property; and 

(4)          payment
of any amount expended in exercising (and the exercise of) all rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under
this Loan Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents. 

Nothing in this Loan Agreement shall obligate
Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds or Collateral Account Funds on account of any Event of Default
or to repayment of the Indebtedness or in any specific order of priority. 

(c)          Remedies
Cumulative. 

Each right and remedy
provided in this Loan Agreement is distinct from all other rights or remedies under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document
or afforded by applicable law, and each shall be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently, independently, or successively,
in any order. Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of additional
default by Borrower in order to exercise any of its remedies with respect to an Event of Default. 

(d)          Operations
upon Event of Default; Lockbox Account. 

(1)          If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: 

(A)          Borrower
shall or shall cause each Property Operator to, at the option of Lender, continue to provide all necessary services required under
each Facility Operating Agreement or applicable licensing or regulatory requirements to operate and manage the Mortgaged Property
as a Seniors Housing Facility and shall fully cooperate with Lender and any receiver as may be appointed by a court, in performing
these services and agrees to arrange for an orderly transition to a replacement property operator or provider of the necessary
services, and to execute promptly all applications, assignments, consents, and documents requested by Lender to facilitate such
transition; and 

(B)          Lender
may cause the removal of Borrower or any Property Operator (as applicable) from any Mortgaged Property operations. Until such time
as Lender has located a replacement property operator, Borrower or the acting Property Operator shall continue to provide all required
services to maintain the Mortgaged Property in full compliance with all License and regulatory requirements. Borrower acknowledges
that its failure to perform or to cause the performance of this service shall constitute a form of waste of the Mortgaged Property,
causing irreparable harm to Lender and the Mortgaged Property, and shall constitute sufficient cause for the appointment of a receiver. 

(2)          In
addition to the remedies set forth herein and elsewhere in the Loan Documents, upon an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled
to mandate the use of a lockbox bank account or other depositary account, to be maintained under the control and supervision of
Lender, for all income of the Mortgaged Property, including Rents, service charges, insurance payments, and Third Party Payments. 

Section
14.03      Additional Lender Rights; Forbearance. 

(a)           No
Effect Upon Obligations. 

Lender may, but shall
not be obligated to, agree with Borrower, from time to time, and without giving notice to, or obtaining the consent of, or having
any effect upon the obligations of, any Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or other third party obligor, to take any
of the following actions: 

(1)          the
time for payment of the principal of or interest on the Indebtedness may be extended, or the Indebtedness may be renewed in whole
or in part; 

(2)          the
rate of interest on or period of amortization of the Mortgage Loan or the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payments payable under
the Loan Documents may be modified; 

(3)          the
time for Borrower s performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document, whether presently
existing or hereinafter entered into, may be extended or such performance or compliance may be waived; 

(4)          any
or all payments due under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document may be reduced; 

(5)          any
Loan Document may be modified or amended by Lender and Borrower in any respect, including an increase in the principal amount of
the Mortgage Loan; 

(6)          any
amounts under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document may be released; 

(7)          any
security for the Indebtedness may be modified, exchanged, released, surrendered, or otherwise dealt with, or additional security
may be pledged or mortgaged for the Indebtedness; 

(8)          the
payment of the Indebtedness or any security for the Indebtedness, or both, may be subordinated to the right to payment or the security,
or both, of any other present or future creditor of Borrower; or 

(9)          any
other terms of the Loan Documents may be modified. 

(b)           No
Waiver of Rights or Remedies. 

Any waiver of an Event
of Default or forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise
afforded by applicable law, shall not be a waiver of any other Event of Default or preclude the exercise or failure to exercise
of any other right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness after the due date of
such payment, or in an amount which is less than the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender s right to require
prompt payment when due of all other payments on account of the Indebtedness or to exercise any remedies for any failure to make
prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any security for the Indebtedness shall not constitute an election by Lender of remedies
so as to preclude the exercise or failure to exercise of any other right available to Lender. Lender s receipt of any insurance
proceeds or amounts in connection with a Condemnation Action shall not operate to cure or waive any Event of Default. 

(c)           Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby irrevocably
makes, constitutes, and appoints Lender (and any officer of Lender or any Person designated by Lender for that purpose) as Borrower s
true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact (and agent-in-fact) in Borrower s name, place, and stead, with full power of substitution,
to: 

(1)          use
any of the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account for the purpose of making or completing the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(2)          make
such additions, changes, and corrections to the Replacements or Repairs as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(3)          employ
such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects, and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; 

(4)          pay,
settle, or compromise all bills and claims for materials and work performed in connection with the Replacements or Repairs, or
as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Replacements or Repairs, or for clearance of title; 

(5)          adjust
and compromise any claims under any and all policies of insurance required pursuant to this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Document,
subject only to Borrower s rights under this Loan Agreement; 

(6)          appear
in and prosecute any action arising from any insurance policies; 

(7)          collect
and receive the proceeds of insurance, and to deduct from such proceeds Lender s expenses incurred in the collection of such
proceeds; 

(8)          commence,
appear in, and prosecute, in Lender s or Borrower s name, any Condemnation Action; 

(9)          settle
or compromise any claim in connection with any Condemnation Action; 

(10)         execute
all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; 

(11)         prosecute
and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Mortgaged Property or the rehabilitation and repair of the Mortgaged
Property; 

(12)         take
such actions as are permitted in this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Documents; 

(13)         execute
such financing statements and other documents and to do such other acts as Lender may require to perfect and preserve Lender s
security interest in, and to enforce such interests in, the collateral; and 

(14)         carry
out any remedy provided for in this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Documents, including endorsing Borrower s name to checks,
drafts, instruments and other items of payment and proceeds of the collateral, executing change of address forms with the postmaster
of the United States Post Office serving the address of Borrower, changing the address of Borrower to that of Lender, opening all
envelopes addressed to Borrower, and applying any payments contained therein to the Indebtedness. 

Borrower hereby acknowledges
that the constitution and appointment of such proxy and attorney-in-fact are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable and shall
not be affected by the disability or incompetence of Borrower. Borrower specifically acknowledges and agrees that this power of
attorney granted to Lender may be assigned by Lender to Lender s successors or assigns as holder of the Note (and the other
Loan Documents). The foregoing powers conferred on Lender under this Section 14.03(c) shall not impose any duty upon Lender to
exercise any such powers and shall not require Lender to incur any expense or take any action. Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms
all that such attorney-in-fact may do or cause to be done by virtue of any provision of this Loan Agreement and any other Loan
Documents. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions, Lender shall not exercise its rights as set forth in this Section 14.03(c) unless: (A) an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, or (B) Lender determines, in its discretion, that exigent circumstances exist or that such exercise is necessary
or prudent in order to protect and preserve the Mortgaged Property, or Lender s lien priority and security interest in the
Mortgaged Property. 

(d)           Borrower
Waivers. 

If more than one Person
signs this Loan Agreement as Borrower, each Borrower, with respect to any other Borrower, hereby agrees that Lender, in its discretion,
may: 

(1)          bring
suit against Borrower, or any one or more of Borrower, jointly and severally, or against any one or more of them; 

(2)          compromise
or settle with any one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, for such consideration as Lender may deem proper; 

(3)          release
one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, from liability; or 

(4)          otherwise
deal with Borrower, or any one or more of them, in any manner, and no such action shall impair the rights of Lender to collect
from any Borrower the full amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section
14.04     Waiver of Marshaling. 

Notwithstanding the
existence of any other security interests in the Mortgaged Property held by Lender or by any other party, Lender shall have the
right to determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged Property shall be subjected to the remedies provided in this
Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document or applicable law. Lender shall have the right to determine the order in which all or any
part of the Indebtedness is satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of such remedies. Borrower and any party who
now or in the future acquires a security interest in the Mortgaged Property and who has actual or constructive notice of this Loan
Agreement waives any and all right to require the marshaling of assets or to require that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold
in the inverse order of alienation or that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in parcels or as an entirety in connection with
the exercise of any of the remedies permitted by applicable law or provided in this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Documents. 

Lender shall account
for any moneys received by Lender in respect of any foreclosure on or disposition of collateral hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents provided that Lender shall not have any duty as to any collateral, and Lender shall be accountable only for amounts that
it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers. NONE OF LENDER OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO BORROWER (a) FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE,
EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE SOLELY TO THEIR OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS FINALLY DETERMINED PURSUANT
TO A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE COURT ORDER BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, NOR (b) FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES.

from Lender, and (2) promptly providing Lender with copies of notices received by Borrower from Property Operator. Borrower s
compliance with or failure to act as an intermediary as described in this Section 15.02(e) shall not relieve Borrower from its
obligations under this Loan Agreement, nor shall it constitute a defense or excuse for nonperformance by Borrower, Property Operator,
or any Guarantor, as applicable. Lender shall have no obligation to provide any notice to Property Operator unless and until Lender
has taken ownership or control of the Mortgaged Property, or in connection with Lender s exercise of the power of attorney
granted herein, and then only as required by the Loan Documents or the Facility Operating Agreement.

Agreement. 

This Loan Agreement
shall bind, and the rights granted by this Loan Agreement shall inure to, the successors and assigns of Lender and the permitted
successors and assigns of Borrower. However, a Transfer not permitted by this Loan Agreement shall be an Event of Default and shall
be void ab initio. 

(b)           Sale
of Mortgage Loan; Change of Servicer. 

Nothing in this Loan
Agreement shall limit Lender s (including its successors and assigns) right to sell or transfer the Mortgage Loan or any
interest in the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan or a partial interest in the Mortgage Loan (together with this Loan Agreement
and the other Loan Documents) may be sold one or more times without prior written notice to Borrower. A sale may result in a change
of the Loan Servicer. 

Section

(a)           Solely
Creditor and Debtor. 

The relationship between
Lender and Borrower shall be solely that of creditor and debtor, respectively, and nothing contained in this Loan Agreement shall
create any other relationship between Lender and Borrower, nor between Lender and Property Operator. Nothing contained in this
Loan Agreement shall constitute Lender as a joint venturer, partner, or agent of Borrower or Property Operator, or render Lender
liable for any debts, obligations, acts, omissions, representations, or contracts of Borrower or Property Operator. 

(b)           No
Third Party Beneficiaries.

shall be deemed or construed to create an obligation on the part of Lender to any third party nor shall any third party have a
right to enforce against Lender any right that Borrower may have under this Loan Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing: 

(1)          any
Servicing Arrangement between Lender and any Loan Servicer shall constitute a contractual obligation of such Loan Servicer that
is independent of the obligation of Borrower for the payment of the Indebtedness; 

(2)          Borrower
shall not be a third party beneficiary of any Servicing Arrangement; and

Section
15.07      Severability; Entire Agreement; Amendments. 

The invalidity or unenforceability
of any provision of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other

Guaranty. This Loan Agreement contains the complete and entire agreement among the parties as to the matters covered, rights granted,

(f)           Whenever
Borrower s knowledge is implicated in this Loan Agreement or the phrase  to Borrower s knowledge  or a
similar phrase is used in this Loan Agreement, Borrower s knowledge or such phrase(s) shall be interpreted to mean to the
best of Borrower s knowledge after reasonable and diligent inquiry and investigation. 

(g)           Unless
otherwise provided in this Loan Agreement, if Lender s approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate, action,
or decision is required, permitted, or contemplated hereunder, such approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate,
action or decision shall be made in Lender s sole and absolute discretion. 

(h)           All
references in this Loan Agreement to a separate instrument or agreement shall include such instrument or agreement as the same
may be amended or supplemented from time to time pursuant to the applicable provisions thereof. 

(i)            Lender
may  shall mean at Lender s discretion, but shall not be an obligation. 

(j)           If
the Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed on a date that is later than the Effective Date, as described in Section 2.02(a)(1), the
representations and warranties in the Loan Documents with respect to the ownership and operation of the Mortgaged Property shall
be deemed to be made as of the disbursement date. 

(k)           Any
references in this Loan Agreement to a Senior Housing Facility shall refer to the Mortgaged Property identified on the Summary
of Loan Terms including the Seniors Housing Facility Licensing Designation. 

(l)           Each
reference to  tenant  or  tenants  in the Loan Documents shall be interpreted to mean  subtenant

Section
15.09     Mortgage Loan Servicing. 

All actions regarding
the servicing of the Mortgage Loan, including the collection of payments, the giving and receipt of notice, inspections of the
Mortgaged Property, inspections of books and records, and the granting of consents and approvals, may be taken by the Loan Servicer
unless Borrower receives notice to the contrary. If Borrower receives conflicting notices regarding the identity of the Loan Servicer
or any other subject, any such written notice from Lender shall govern. The Loan Servicer may change from time to time (whether
related or unrelated to a sale of the Mortgage Loan). If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written
notice of the change. 

Section
15.10     Disclosure of Information. 

Lender may furnish
information regarding Borrower, Property Operator, Key Principal, Guarantor, or the Mortgaged Property to third parties with an
existing or prospective interest in the servicing, enforcement, evaluation, performance, purchase, or securitization of the Mortgage
Loan, including trustees, master servicers, special servicers, rating agencies, and organizations maintaining databases on the
underwriting and performance of multifamily mortgage loans. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all rights it may have under applicable
law to prohibit such disclosure, including any right of privacy. 

Section
15.11     Waiver; Conflict. 

No specific waiver
of any of the terms of this Loan Agreement shall be considered as a general waiver. If any provision of this Loan Agreement is
in conflict with any provision of any other Loan Document, the provision contained in this Loan Agreement shall control.

15.12     No Reliance. 

Borrower acknowledges,
represents, and warrants that: 

(a)           it
understands the nature and structure of the transactions contemplated by this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents; 

(b)           it
is familiar with the provisions of all of the documents and instruments relating to such transactions; 

(c)           it
understands the risks inherent in such transactions, including the risk of loss of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property; 

(d)           it
has had the opportunity to consult counsel; and 

(e)           it
has not relied on Lender for any guidance or expertise in analyzing the financial or other consequences of the transactions contemplated
by this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise relied on Lender in any manner in connection with interpreting,
entering into, or otherwise in connection with this Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any of the matters contemplated
hereby or thereby. 

Section
15.13     Subrogation. 

If, and to the extent
that, the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan are used to pay, satisfy, or discharge any obligation of Borrower or Property Operator
for the payment of money that is secured by a pre-existing mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien encumbering the Mortgaged Property,
such Mortgage Loan proceeds shall be deemed to have been advanced by Lender at Borrower s request, and Lender shall automatically,
and without further action on its part, be subrogated to the rights, including lien priority, of the owner or holder of the obligation
secured by such prior lien, whether or not such prior lien is released. 

Section
15.14     Counting of Days. 

Except where otherwise
specifically provided, any reference in this Loan Agreement to a period of  days  means calendar days, not Business
Days. If the date on which Borrower is required to perform an obligation under this Loan Agreement is not a Business Day, Borrower
shall be required to perform such obligation by the Business Day immediately preceding such date; provided, however, in respect
of any Payment Date, or if the Maturity Date is other than a Business Day, Borrower shall be obligated to make such payment by
the Business Day immediately following such date. 

Section
15.15      Revival and Reinstatement of Indebtedness. 

If the payment of all
or any part of the Indebtedness by Borrower, Property Operator, any Guarantor, or any other Person, or the transfer to Lender of
any collateral or other property should for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal
law relating to creditors  rights, including provisions of the Insolvency Laws relating to a Voidable Transfer, and if Lender
is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the advice of its counsel,
then the amount of such Voidable Transfer or the amount of such Voidable Transfer that Lender is required or elects to repay or
restore, including all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys  fees incurred by Lender in connection therewith, and the
Indebtedness shall be automatically revived, reinstated, and restored by such amount and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer
had never been made. 

Section
15.16      Time is of the Essence. 

Borrower agrees that,
with respect to each and every obligation and covenant contained in this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, time is of

and any of their provisions may not be waived, modified, amended, discharged, or terminated except by an agreement in writing signed
by the party against which the enforcement of the waiver, modification, amendment, discharge, or termination is sought, and then
only to the extent set forth in that agreement.

SCHEDULE 3 TO 

  MULTIFAMILY LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  

Schedule of Interest Rate Type Provisions 

 (Structured ARM (1 and 3 Month LIBOR))
and Fixed Rate Conversion Option 

1.  Defined Terms. 

Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in this Schedule have the meanings given to such terms in the Definitions Schedule to the Loan Agreement. 

2.  Interest Accrual. 

Except as otherwise provided
in the Loan Agreement, interest shall accrue at the Adjustable Rate until the Mortgage Loan is fully paid. 

3.  Adjustable Rate; Adjustments. 

The Initial Adjustable
Rate shall be effective until the first Rate Change Date. Thereafter, the Adjustable Rate shall change on each Rate Change Date
based on fluctuations in the Current Index. 

4.  Fixed Monthly Principal Component. 

Each amortizing Monthly
Debt Service Payment shall include a principal payment equal to the Fixed Monthly Principal Component, which shall be determined
using the Fixed Rate Amortization Factor. 

5.  Notification of Interest Rate Change and Monthly Debt Service
Payment. 

Before each Payment Change
Date, Lender shall notify Borrower of any change in the Adjustable Rate and the amount of the next Monthly Debt Service Payment. 

6.  Correction to Monthly Debt Service Payments. 

If Lender determines at
any time that it has miscalculated the amount of a Monthly Debt Service Payment (whether because of a miscalculation of the Adjustable
Rate or otherwise), then Lender shall give notice to Borrower of the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment (and
the corrected Adjustable Rate, if applicable) and (a) if the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents an
increase, then Borrower shall, within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, pay to Lender any sums that Borrower would have otherwise
been obligated to pay to Lender had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated, or (b) if the corrected
amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents a decrease and Borrower is not otherwise in default under any of the Loan
Documents, then Borrower shall thereafter be paid the sums that Borrower would not have otherwise been obligated to pay to Lender
had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated. 

7.  Conversion to Fixed Rate. 

(a)    Conversion Option.  

(1)         Subject
to the following terms and conditions, Borrower may exercise the Conversion Option pursuant to which the interest rate payable
on the Mortgage Loan may be converted, one (1) time only, on any Payment Date during the Conversion Period from the Adjustable
Rate to the Fixed Rate, after which the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan shall remain at the Fixed Rate until the New Maturity
Date. 

(2)         For
Mortgage Loans that are full-term interest-only, the Amortization Period from and after the Conversion Effective Date shall be
three hundred sixty (360) months. For all other Mortgage Loans, including Mortgage Loans that are partial interest-only or amortizing,
the Amortization Period from and after the Conversion Effective Date shall be: 

(A)         three
hundred sixty (360) months, if (i) Borrower selects a Fixed Rate Option having a term greater than or equal to the original term
of the Mortgage Loan from the Effective Date through the Maturity Date, and (ii) the most recent inspection of the Mortgaged Property
by Lender resulted in a rating of either  1  or  2  or 

(B)         in
all other cases, the number of months equal to (A) three hundred sixty (360) months, minus (B) the number of Monthly Debt Service
Payments that have elapsed since the Effective Date. 

(3)         The
Monthly Debt Service Payment following a Conversion shall be in an amount required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan immediately prior to the Initial Fixed Rate Payment Date in equal monthly installments, including accrued interest at the
Fixed Rate, over the Amortization Period utilizing the 30/360 Interest Accrual Method even if Actual/360 is the Interest Accrual
Method. 

(4)         The
Conversion Option shall lapse (A) at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the expiration of the Conversion
Period if Borrower has not previously delivered to Lender an NOI Determination Request in accordance with the terms of this Schedule
or (B) on the Conversion Effective Date, if the Conversion Option is timely exercised but the Fixed Rate does not become effective
on such Conversion Effective Date. 

(5)         It
is anticipated that the Conversion will be effected by the issuance by Lender of a fixed-rate MBS or by the cash purchase of the
Mortgage Loan by Lender into its portfolio (subject to the provisions of Section 7(b)(2) of this Schedule). Borrower acknowledges,
however, that the Conversion is contingent on the capital markets generally, and that from time to time, disruptions in the capital
markets may make Conversion infeasible. In the event Lender is not able to obtain any quotes for the Mortgage Loan at the Fixed
Rate (and does not make a cash bid for the Mortgage Loan), or if the quotes exceed the Maximum Fixed Rate, the interest rate on
the Mortgage Loan shall remain at the Adjustable Rate. 

(b)    Procedures for Conversion.  

(1)    NOI Determination Request.  

(A)         Subject
to the terms of the Loan Agreement, if Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option, Borrower shall submit an NOI Determination
Request to Lender, which shall include Borrower s selection of a Fixed Rate Option. 

(B)         The
NOI Determination Request shall be accompanied by the Conversion Review Fee in the form of a check payable to Lender or by wire
transfer to an account designated by Lender. 

(C)         In
no event shall the NOI Determination Request be made prior to the commencement of the Conversion Period or less than ninety (90)
days prior to the expiration of the Conversion Period. Borrower may not submit an NOI Determination Request if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing at the time of the request or if an Event of Default has occurred at any time within the twelve
(12) month period immediately preceding the date of Borrower s request. In addition, Borrower may not submit an NOI Determination
Request more than twice in any Loan Year. Borrower shall submit to Lender, within five (5) days after receipt of a request therefor,
all information relating to the operation of the Mortgaged Property required by Lender to determine the Net Operating Income and
Borrower s compliance with Section 7 of this Schedule. If Borrower fails to provide such information within such period,
Borrower s NOI Determination Request shall be deemed canceled (however, such canceled NOI Determination Request shall count
as a request for the Loan Year in which the request was made). 

(2)    Conversion Eligibility Determination.  

(A)         Within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of an NOI Determination Request (or, if Lender requests additional information from Borrower pursuant
to Section 7(b)(2)(B) of this Schedule, within fifteen (15) days after Lender s receipt of such additional information),
Lender shall determine the Net Operating Income of the Mortgaged Property and the Maximum Fixed Rate to which the Mortgage Loan
may be converted and shall provide Borrower with the NOI Determination Notice. 

(B)         Lender
shall determine the Net Operating Income for the trailing twelve (12) month period on the basis of the most recently received quarterly
financial statements (as such statements may be adjusted by Lender as necessary to accurately reflect items of income, operating
expenses, ground lease payments, if applicable, and replacement reserves to reflect suitable underwriting) prepared by Borrower
for the Mortgaged Property. In connection with any request by Lender for additional information, Borrower shall have five (5) days
after Borrower s receipt of such request to provide Lender with such additional information. 

(C)         Borrower
may not exercise the Conversion Option unless Lender determines that, based upon the Net Operating Income set forth in the NOI
Determination Notice and the Fixed Rate quoted in connection with a Rate Lock Request, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
Mortgaged Property is equal to or greater than the Minimum Conversion Debt Service Coverage Ratio. 

(3)    Exercise of Conversion Option; Rate Lock Request.  

(A)         If,
after receipt of the NOI Determination Notice, Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option, Borrower shall, within fifteen
(15) days of Borrower s receipt of the NOI Determination Notice: 

(i)          provide
Lender with a title report for the Mortgaged Property prepared by, or by an agent for, the issuer of the Title Policy, showing
marketable fee simple or leasehold title to the Mortgaged Property (as applicable) to be vested in Borrower, free and clear of
all Liens and other matters affecting title other than the Permitted Encumbrances; 

(ii)         pay
to Lender the Good Faith Deposit; and 

(iii)        make
a Rate Lock Request. 

(B)         If
the Conversion closes, Lender shall refund the Good Faith Deposit to Borrower within thirty (30) days after the Conversion Closing
Date. If Borrower pays the Good Faith Deposit but does not timely exercise the Conversion Option and the Fixed Rate is not rate
locked, Lender shall refund the Good Faith Deposit to Borrower within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a written request from
Borrower (and the interest rate shall remain at the Adjustable Rate). If Borrower timely exercises the Conversion Option, but the
Conversion is not consummated for any reason other than a default by Lender in performing its obligations under the Loan Agreement,
Borrower shall forfeit the Good Faith Deposit and (i) if the MBS Investor is not Fannie Mae, shall be fully liable for, and agrees
to pay on demand, any and all loss, costs and/or damages incurred by Lender in connection with Borrower s failure to consummate
the Conversion as provided herein, including any loss, costs and/or damages incurred by Lender in excess of the Good Faith Deposit,
and (ii) if the MBS Investor is Fannie Mae or if the converted Mortgage Loan is held by Fannie Mae and does not back an MBS, the
Good Faith Deposit shall serve as liquidated damages resulting from failure to consummate the Conversion. Borrower expressly acknowledges
that by electing to convert the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan to the Fixed Rate, and agreeing to the Fixed Rate as provided
herein, Borrower is causing Lender to take a position in the financial markets in reliance thereon, and the failure of Borrower
to convert the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan to the Fixed Rate as provided herein may cause Lender to incur economic damages. 

(C)         If
Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option and has complied with all other requirements of Section 7(d) of this Schedule,
within fifteen (15) days of Borrower s receipt of the NOI Determination Notice, Borrower shall contact Lender to initiate
a Rate Lock Request. If the Fixed Rate quoted to Borrower is greater than the Maximum Fixed Rate, Borrower shall not be permitted
to accept the quoted Fixed Rate (or exercise its Conversion Option). On or before 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) of the day Borrower
accepts the quoted Fixed Rate, Borrower and Lender shall confirm to each other (by letter addressed from Lender to Borrower, acknowledged
and accepted in writing by Borrower and transmitted, in each case, by facsimile or other electronic transmission acceptable to
Lender), (i) the Fixed Rate, (ii) the New Maturity Date (if applicable), (iii) the Conversion Effective Date, (iv) the new Monthly
Debt Service Payment and (v) the Initial Fixed Rate Payment Date. 

(c)    Amendment to Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement.  

The Conversion
shall be evidenced by the Conversion Amendment. 

(d)    Conditions Precedent to Closing of Conversion.  

Borrower s
right to consummate the Conversion and Lender s obligation to execute and deliver the Conversion Amendment, shall be subject
to satisfaction of the conditions precedent below. 

(1)         All
representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on
and as of the Conversion Closing Date as though made on and as of the Conversion Closing Date. 

(2)         Borrower
shall have performed or complied with all of its obligations under the Loan Agreement to be performed or complied with on or before
the Conversion Closing Date. 

(3)         On
the Conversion Closing Date, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or any event which, with the giving of
notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). 

(4)         On
the Conversion Closing Date, Lender shall have received all of the following, each of which, where applicable, shall be executed
by individuals authorized to do so, shall be dated as of the Closing Date, and shall be in form and substance acceptable to Lender: 

(A)         the
Conversion Amendment; 

(B)         an
endorsement to the Title Policy or a new Title Policy as of the Conversion Closing Date showing that the Security Instrument constitutes
a valid mortgage lien on the Mortgaged Property, with the same lien priority insured by the Title Policy, subject only to the Permitted
Encumbrances; 

(C)         either
(i) the Survey, redated to a date within fifteen (15) days prior to the Conversion Closing Date showing that there are no Liens
or other matters that have arisen since the date of the Survey other than matters approved in writing by Lender, or (ii) affirmative
coverage in the title insurance endorsement referred to in Section 7(d)(4)(B) that there are no exceptions based upon the results
of a visual inspection of the Mortgaged Property, or the absence of any exception based upon any facts or conditions which have
arisen since the date of the Survey and which would be disclosed by a current survey of the Mortgaged Property; 

(D)         if
necessary, as determined by Lender, an amendment to the Security Instrument to be recorded in the land records and insured as a
supplement to the Security Instrument to reflect the New Maturity Date; 

(E)         an
opinion of counsel satisfactory to Lender as to such matters as Lender may reasonably request; and 

(F)         such
other documents as Lender may reasonably request related to the Loan Agreement, the Conversion Amendment or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. 

(5)         The
Mortgaged Property shall not have been damaged, destroyed or subject to any condemnation or other taking, in whole or any material
part, and Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower, dated as of the Conversion Closing Date, to such effect. 

8.  Property Condition Assessment. 

Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 13.02(a)(3)(A), if the Conversion Option is exercised for any Mortgaged Property other than an  affordable housing
property  (as indicated on the Summary of Loan Terms), and extends the Loan Term, then a new property condition assessment
shall be required in the earlier of (a) the Loan Year that would have been the final Loan Year of the Mortgage Loan had the Conversion
Option not been exercised, or (b) the tenth (10th) Loan Year.

Section
2.01           Mortgage Loan Origination and Security. 

(a)            Making
of Mortgage Loan. 

Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Lender hereby makes the Mortgage Loan to Borrower, and Borrower
hereby accepts the Mortgage Loan from Lender. Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall: 

(1)           pay
the Indebtedness, including the Prepayment Premium, if any (whether in connection with any voluntary prepayment or in connection
with an acceleration by Lender of the Indebtedness), in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
and 

(2)           perform,
observe, and comply with this Loan Agreement and all other provisions of the other Loan Documents. 

(b)           Security
for Mortgage Loan. 

The Mortgage Loan is made
pursuant to this Loan Agreement, is evidenced by the Note, and is secured by the Security Instrument, this Loan Agreement, and
the other Loan Documents that are expressly stated to be security for the Mortgage Loan. 

(c)           Protective
Advances. 

As provided in the Security
Instrument, Lender may take such actions or disburse such funds as Lender reasonably deems necessary to perform the obligations
of Borrower under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to protect Lender s interest in the Mortgaged Property. 

Section
2.02          Payments on Mortgage Loan. 

(a)            Debt
Service Payments. 

(1)             Short
Month Interest.  

If the date the
Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed is any day other than the first day of the month, interest for the period beginning on the
disbursement date and ending on and including the last day of the month in which the disbursement occurs shall be payable by Borrower
on the date the Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed. In the event that the disbursement date is not the same as the Effective
Date, then: 

(A)           the
disbursement date and the Effective Date must be in the same month, and 

Article 2  

(B)           the
Effective Date shall not be the first day of the month. 

(2)             Interest
Accrual and Computation.  

Except as provided
in Section 2.02(a)(1), interest shall be paid in arrears. Interest shall accrue as provided in the Schedule of Interest Rate Type
Provisions and shall be computed in accordance with the Interest Accrual Method. If the Interest Accrual Method is  Actual/360, 
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the amount allocated to interest for each month will vary depending on the actual number
of calendar days during such month. 

(3)             Monthly
Debt Service Payments.  

Consecutive monthly
debt service installments (comprised of either interest only or principal and interest, depending on the Amortization Type), each
in the amount of the applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment, shall be due and payable on the First Payment Date, and on each Payment
Date thereafter until the Maturity Date, at which time all Indebtedness shall be due. Any regularly scheduled Monthly Debt Service
Payment that is received by Lender before the applicable Payment Date shall be deemed to have been received on such Payment Date
solely for the purpose of calculating interest due. All payments made by Borrower under this Loan Agreement shall be made without
set-off, counterclaim, or other defense. 

(4)             Payment
at Maturity.  

The unpaid principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan, any Accrued Interest thereon and all other Indebtedness shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date. 

(5)             Interest
Rate Type.  

See the Schedule
of Interest Rate Type Provisions for additional provisions, if any, specific to the Interest Rate Type. 

(b)            Capitalization
of Accrued But Unpaid Interest. 

Any accrued and unpaid
interest on the Mortgage Loan remaining past due for thirty (30) days or more may, at Lender s election, be added to and
become part of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan. 

Article 2  

(c)            Late
Charges. 

(1)           If
any Monthly Debt Service Payment due hereunder is not received by Lender within ten (10) days (or fifteen (15) days for any Mortgaged
Property located in Mississippi or North Carolina to comply with applicable law) after the applicable Payment Date, or any amount
payable under this Loan Agreement (other than the payment due on the Maturity Date for repayment of the Mortgage Loan in full)
or any other Loan Document is not received by Lender within ten (10) days (or fifteen (15) days for any Mortgaged Property located
in Mississippi or North Carolina to comply with applicable law) after the date such amount is due, inclusive of the date on which
such amount is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender, immediately without demand by Lender, the Late Charge. 

The Late Charge is payable in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any interest payable at the Default Rate pursuant to Section 2.02(d). 

(2)           Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)           its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Mortgage Loan; 

(B)           it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine those additional expenses; 

(C)           Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional expenses; and 

(D)           the
Late Charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into account all circumstances existing on the date hereof, of the
additional expenses Lender will incur by reason of any such late payment. 

(d)            Default
Rate. 

(1)            Default
interest shall be paid as follows: 

(A)           If
any amount due in respect of the Mortgage Loan (other than amounts due on the Maturity Date) remains past due for thirty (30) days
or more, interest on such unpaid amount(s) shall accrue from the date payment is due at the Default Rate and shall be payable upon
demand by Lender. 

(B)           If
any Indebtedness due is not paid in full on the Maturity Date, then interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on all such unpaid
amounts from the Maturity Date until fully paid and shall be payable upon demand by Lender. 

Absent a demand by Lender, any such
amounts shall be payable by Borrower in the same manner as provided for the payment of Monthly Debt Service Payments. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, interest shall also accrue at the Default Rate on any judgment obtained by Lender against Borrower
in connection with the Mortgage Loan. To the extent Borrower or any other Person is vested with a right of redemption, interest
shall continue to accrue at the Default Rate during any redemption period until such time as the Mortgaged Property has been redeemed. 

Article 2  

(2)            Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)           its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Mortgage Loan; and 

(B)           in
connection with any failure to timely pay all amounts due in respect of the Mortgage Loan on the Maturity Date, or during the time
that any amount due in respect of the Mortgage Loan is delinquent for more than thirty (30) days: 

(i)           Lender s
risk of nonpayment of the Mortgage Loan will be materially increased; 

(ii)          Lender s
ability to meet its other obligations and to take advantage of other investment opportunities will be adversely impacted; 

(iii)         Lender
will incur additional costs and expenses arising from its loss of the use of the amounts due; 

(iv)         it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine such additional costs and expenses; 

(v)          Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional risks, costs, and expenses; and 

(vi)         the
increase from the Interest Rate to the Default Rate represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the additional risks, costs, and
expenses Lender will incur by reason of Borrower s delinquent payment and the additional compensation Lender is entitled
to receive for the increased risks of nonpayment associated with a delinquency on the Mortgage Loan (taking into account all circumstances
existing on the Effective Date). 

(e)            Address
for Payments. 

All payments due pursuant
to the Loan Documents shall be payable at Lender s Payment Address, or such other place and in such manner as may be designated
from time to time by written notice to Borrower by Lender. 

Article 2  

(f)            Application
of Payments. 

If at any time Lender receives,
from Borrower or otherwise, any payment in respect of the Indebtedness that is less than all amounts due and payable at such time,
then Lender may apply such payment to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by Lender or hold
in suspense and not apply such payment at Lender s election. Neither Lender s acceptance of a payment that is less
than all amounts then due and payable, nor Lender s application of, or suspension of the application of, such payment, shall
constitute or be deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding the
application of any such payment to the Indebtedness, Borrower s obligations under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall remain unchanged. 

Section
2.03          Lockout/Prepayment. 

(a)            Prepayment;
Prepayment Lockout; Prepayment Premium. 

(1)           Borrower
shall not make a voluntary full or partial prepayment on the Mortgage Loan during any Prepayment Lockout Period nor shall Borrower
make a voluntary partial prepayment at any time. Except as expressly provided in this Loan Agreement (including as provided in
the Prepayment Premium Schedule), a Prepayment Premium calculated in accordance with the Prepayment Premium Schedule shall be payable
in connection with any prepayment of the Mortgage Loan. 

(2)           If
a Prepayment Lockout Period applies to the Mortgage Loan, and during such Prepayment Lockout Period Lender accelerates the unpaid
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan or otherwise applies collateral held by Lender to the repayment of any portion of the unpaid
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, the Prepayment Premium shall be due and payable and equal to the amount obtained by multiplying
the percentage indicated (if at all) in the Prepayment Premium Schedule by the amount of principal being prepaid at the time of
such acceleration or application. 

(b)            Voluntary
Prepayment in Full. 

At any time after the expiration
of any Prepayment Lockout Period, Borrower may voluntarily prepay the Mortgage Loan in full on a Permitted Prepayment Date so long
as: 

(1)            Borrower
delivers to Lender a Prepayment Notice specifying the Intended Prepayment Date not more than sixty (60) days, but not less than
thirty (30) days (if given via U.S. Postal Service) or twenty (20) days (if given via facsimile, e-mail, or overnight courier)
prior to such Intended Prepayment Date; and 

(2)            Borrower
pays to Lender an amount equal to the sum of: 

(A)           the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; plus 

(B)           all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the prepayment occurs); plus 

(C)           the
Prepayment Premium; plus 

(D)           all
other Indebtedness. 

Article 2  

In connection with any such voluntary prepayment,
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that interest shall always be calculated and paid through the last day of the month in which the
prepayment occurs (even if the Permitted Prepayment Date for such month is not the last day of such month, or if Lender approves
prepayment on an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date). Borrower further acknowledges that Lender is
not required to accept a voluntary prepayment of the Mortgage Loan on any day other than a Permitted Prepayment Date. However,
if Lender does approve an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date and accepts a prepayment on such Intended
Prepayment Date, such prepayment shall be deemed to be received on the immediately following Permitted Prepayment Date. If Borrower
fails to prepay the Mortgage Loan on the Intended Prepayment Date for any reason (including on any Intended Prepayment Date that
is approved by Lender) and such failure either continues for five (5) Business Days, or into the following month, Lender shall
have the right to recalculate the payoff amount. If Borrower prepays the Mortgage Loan either in the following month or more than
five (5) Business Days after the Intended Prepayment Date that was approved by Lender, Lender shall also have the right to recalculate
the payoff amount based upon the amount of such payment and the date such payment was received by Lender. Borrower shall immediately
pay to Lender any additional amounts required by any such recalculation. 

(c)            Acceleration
of Mortgage Loan. 

Upon acceleration of the
Mortgage Loan, Borrower shall pay to Lender: 

(1)           the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; 

(2)           all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the acceleration occurs); 

(3)           the
Prepayment Premium; and 

(4)           all
other Indebtedness. 

(d)           Application
of Collateral. 

Any application by Lender
of any collateral or other security to the repayment of all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan
prior to the Maturity Date in accordance with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a prepayment by Borrower. Any such prepayment
shall require the payment to Lender by Borrower of the Prepayment Premium calculated on the amount being prepaid in accordance
with this Loan Agreement. 

(e)           Casualty
and Condemnation. 

Notwithstanding any provision
of this Loan Agreement to the contrary, no Prepayment Premium shall be payable with respect to any prepayment occurring as a result
of the application of any insurance proceeds or amounts received in connection with a Condemnation Action in accordance with this
Loan Agreement. 

Article 2  

(f)            No
Effect on Payment Obligations. 

Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Loan Agreement, any prepayment required by any Loan Document of less than the entire unpaid principal balance
of the Mortgage Loan shall not extend or postpone the due date of any subsequent Monthly Debt Service Payments, Monthly Replacement
Reserve Deposit, or other payment, or change the amount of any such payments or deposits. 

(g)            Loss
Resulting from Prepayment. 

In any circumstance in
which a Prepayment Premium is due under this Loan Agreement, Borrower acknowledges that: 

(1)           any
prepayment of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, whether voluntary or involuntary, or following the occurrence
of an Event of Default by Borrower, will result in Lender s incurring loss, including reinvestment loss, additional risk,
expense, and frustration or impairment of Lender s ability to meet its commitments to third parties; 

(2)           it
is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such losses, risks, and damages; 

(3)           the
formula for calculating the Prepayment Premium represents a reasonable estimate of the losses, risks, and damages Lender will incur
as a result of a prepayment; and 

(4)           the
provisions regarding the Prepayment Premium contained in this Loan Agreement are a material part of the consideration for the Mortgage
Loan, and that the terms of the Mortgage Loan are in other respects more favorable to Borrower as a result of Borrower s
voluntary agreement to such prepayment provisions. 

Article
3  - PERSONAL LIABILITY 

Section
3.01          Non-Recourse Mortgage Loan; Exceptions. 

Except as otherwise provided
in this Article 3 or in any other Loan Document, none of Borrower, or any director, officer, manager, member, partner, shareholder,
trustee, trust beneficiary, or employee of Borrower, shall have personal liability under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan
Document for the repayment of the Indebtedness or for the performance of any other obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents,
and Lender s only recourse for the satisfaction of such Indebtedness and the performance of such obligations shall be Lender s
exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Mortgaged Property and any other collateral held by Lender as security
for the Indebtedness. This limitation on Borrower s liability shall not limit or impair Lender s enforcement of its
rights against Guarantor under any Loan Document.

to the extent directed otherwise by Lender pursuant to Section 3.02(a)(1), failure to apply Rents to the ordinary and necessary
expenses of owning or operating, as applicable, the Mortgaged Property and Debt Service Amounts, as and when each is due and payable,
except that Borrower will not be personally liable with respect to Rents that are distributed by Borrower in any calendar year
if Borrower has paid all ordinary and necessary expenses of owning or operating, as applicable, the Mortgaged Property and Debt
Service Amounts for such calendar year; 

(6)           waste
or abandonment of the Mortgaged Property;

Key Principal, or any officer, director, partner, manager, member, shareholder, or trustee of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator,
Guarantor, or Key Principal in connection with on-going financial or other reporting required by the Loan Documents, or any request
for action or consent by Lender; 

Article 3  

(8)           failure
to cause the renewal, continuation, extension, or maintenance of all Licenses or, if any Licenses are to be transferred to a transferee
approved by Lender, failure to cause such Licenses to be transferred or reissued within the period of time required under applicable
law and to provide to Lender written notice of such transfer including copies of the newly issued Licenses; or 

(9)           revocation
or termination without Lender s consent of the standing instructions from Borrower or Property Operator to the depositary
bank pursuant to any Depositary Agreement. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall
not have personal liability under clauses (1), (3), or (5) above to the extent that Borrower lacks the legal right to direct the
disbursement of the applicable funds due to an involuntary Bankruptcy Event that occurs without the consent, encouragement, or

(3)           the
occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event (other than an acknowledgement in writing as described in clause (b) of the definition of  Bankruptcy

or (C) any Person Controlled by or under common Control with Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal;

or Key Principal in connection with any application for or creation of the Indebtedness; or

Guarantor, or Key Principal in connection with on-going financial or other reporting required by the Loan Documents, or any request
for action or consent by Lender. 

Section
3.03           Personal Liability for Indemnity Obligations. 

Borrower shall be personally
and fully liable to Lender for Borrower s indemnity obligations under Section 13.01(e) of this Loan Agreement, the Environmental
Indemnity Agreement, and any other express indemnity obligations provided by Borrower under any Loan Document. Borrower s
liability for such indemnity obligations shall not be limited by the amount of the Indebtedness, the repayment of the Indebtedness,
or otherwise, provided that Borrower s liability for such indemnities shall not include any loss caused by the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of Lender as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

Section
3.04           Lender s Right to Forego Rights Against Mortgaged Property. 

To the extent that Borrower
has personal liability under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, Lender may exercise its rights against Borrower personally
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law without regard to whether Lender has exercised any rights against the Mortgaged
Property, the UCC Collateral, or any other security, or pursued any rights against Guarantor, or pursued any other rights available
to Lender under this Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document, or applicable law. For purposes of this Section 3.04 only, the term
 Mortgaged Property  shall not include any funds that have been applied by Borrower or Property Operator as required
or permitted by this Loan Agreement prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, or that Borrower was unable to apply as required
or permitted by this Loan Agreement because of a Bankruptcy Event. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in any action
to enforce Borrower s personal liability under this Article 3, Borrower waives any right to set off the value of the Mortgaged
Property against such personal liability.

(f)            Effect
of Mortgage Loan on Borrower s Financial Condition. 

The Mortgage Loan will
not render Borrower Insolvent, and the Facility Operating Agreement obligations will not render Affiliated Property Operator insolvent.
Borrower has sufficient working capital, including proceeds from the Mortgage Loan, cash flow from the Mortgaged Property including
the Facility Operating Agreement, or other sources, not only to adequately maintain the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents and the Facility Operating Agreement, but also to pay all of Borrower s outstanding debts as
they come due, including all Debt Service Amounts, exclusive of Borrower s ability to refinance or pay in full the Mortgage
Loan on the Maturity Date. In connection with the execution and delivery of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and
the delivery to, or for the benefit of, Lender of any collateral contemplated thereunder), and the incurrence by Borrower of the
obligations under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower did not receive less than reasonably equivalent value
in exchange for the incurrence of the obligations of Borrower under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Affiliated
Property Operator has sufficient working capital, including cash flow from the Mortgaged Property, or other resources, not only
to maintain the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the terms of the Facility Operating Agreement, but also to pay the rents
and other obligations under the Facility Operating Agreement, as well as other obligations under this Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents that Borrower elects to pass through to Affiliated Property Operator pursuant to the terms of the Facility Operating
Agreement.

(2)            If
any License requirement is imposed upon the Mortgaged Property after the Effective Date, Borrower shall obtain, or shall cause

Article 6  

(g)            Medicaid
Provider Agreement.

neither Borrower nor any Property Operator is a Medicaid Participant as of the Effective Date, Borrower shall notify Lender in
writing thirty (30) days prior to Borrower s or any Property Operator s (with respect to the Mortgaged Property) submission
of its request to enter into a Medicaid Provider Agreement, and will provide Lender with copies of all correspondence and documentation

(2)            The
following provisions apply if a Medicaid Provider Agreement is in place as of the Effective Date or entered into at any time during

effective gross income to be derived from funds paid to Borrower or Property Operator by a Governmental Authority or a Managed
Care Organization, as applicable, under a Medicaid Provider Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower or any Property
Operator is a Medicaid Participant with respect to the Mortgaged Property, and if by reason of applicable law or regulation more
than twenty percent (20%) of effective gross income is derived from funds paid to such Borrower or Property Operator by a Governmental
Authority or a Managed Care Organization, Borrower and Property Operator shall take in a diligent and expeditious manner all reasonable
steps necessary to comply with the preceding sentence to the extent permissible by applicable law or regulation;

(D)            without

(ii)            terminate
the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement;

(E)            within
five (5) days after Borrower s or any Property Operator s receipt thereof, Borrower shall give Lender written notice
of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates that: 

(i)            either
Borrower or any Property Operator is in default under the terms of the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(ii)            the
applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization intends to amend, modify, or terminate the Medicaid Provider Agreement;

or Property Operator has ceased to meet the provider standards required by the applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care
Organization; 

(iv)            Borrower
or Property Operator has received notice from any Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization that the rates for services
provided under the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement will be adjusted; or 

(v)            either
Borrower or any Property Operator has been excluded from participation in any Governmental Health Care Program with respect to
the Mortgaged Property or any other property. 

(h)            Facility
Operating Agreement. 

(1)            The
provisions of this Section 6.02(h)(1) apply to all Facility Operating Agreements other than a Seniors Housing Facility Lease and
to all Property Operators other than a Property Operator under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower shall comply with and
shall enforce the obligations of each Property Operator under each Facility Operating Agreement. Without the prior written consent
of Lender, Borrower shall not: 

Article 6

amend, supplement, or restate any Facility Operating Agreement;

(D)            add
or release a property to or from any Facility Operating Agreement; or 

(E)            violate
the provisions of Section 11.02(c). 

(2)            Within
five (5) days of Borrower s receipt or delivery (or any Property Operator s receipt), Borrower shall provide Lender
written notice of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates either Borrower or any
Property Operator is (A) in default under the terms of any Facility Operating Agreement, (B) amending, modifying, or terminating
any Facility Operating Agreement, or (C) otherwise discontinuing its operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(3)            After
Borrower receives notice (or otherwise has actual knowledge) of an Event of Default under the Loan Documents, it will not make
any payment of fees under or pursuant to the Facility Operating Agreement without Lender s prior written consent. 

(4)            Borrower
shall cause each Property Operator, where applicable, to comply with the terms, conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative
and negative covenants of this Loan Agreement relating to the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property, including all terms,
conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants set forth in this Loan Agreement applicable to the
organization, existence, and good standing of Property Operator necessary for the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property. 

(i)            Change
in Property Operator. 

Each Property Operator
and each Facility Operating Agreement must be approved in writing in advance by Lender. Borrower shall not remove or permit or
suffer the removal of any Property Operator without the prior written consent of Lender and unless and until Lender has approved
in writing a replacement Property Operator. Each Facility Operating Agreement or other similar agreement between Borrower and a
new Property Operator must be approved in writing in advance by Lender, and Borrower and the new Property Operator must execute
and deliver to Lender a SASA in form required by Lender, subject to the provisions of Section 6.03(a). Borrower shall notify Lender
in writing of any name change of an Affiliated Property Operator or any change in an Affiliated Property Operator s place
of incorporation or organization. Borrower agrees that Lender shall have the right to remove any Property Operator at any time
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, subject to the provisions of the SASA. 

Article 6  

(j)            Contracts. 

Borrower may in the future
enter into Contracts for the provision of additional goods or services at or otherwise in connection with the operation, use, or
management of the Mortgaged Property. Borrower absolutely and unconditionally pledges, grants a security interest in, and assigns
to Lender all of Borrower s right, title, and interest in, to, and under the Contracts, including Borrower s right,
power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Until Lender gives notice to Borrower of Lender s
exercise of its rights under this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall have all right, power, and authority granted to Borrower under
any Contract (except as otherwise limited by this subsection or any other provision of this Loan Agreement), including the right,
power, and authority to modify the terms of any Contract or extend or terminate any Contract. If an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, and at the option of Lender, the permission given to Borrower pursuant to the preceding sentence to exercise
all right, power, and authority under Contracts shall terminate. Upon Lender s delivery of notice to Borrower of an Event
of Default, Lender shall immediately have all right, power, and authority granted to Borrower under any Contract, including the
right, power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Borrower shall fully perform all of
its obligations under the Contracts, and Borrower agrees not to assign, sell, pledge, transfer, mortgage, or otherwise encumber
its interests in any of the Contracts without the prior written approval of Lender. Each Contract entered into by Borrower subsequent
to the date hereof, the average annual consideration of which, directly or indirectly, is at least $50,000, shall provide: (A)
that it shall be terminable for cause, and (B) that it shall be terminable, at Lender s option, upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default. 

(k)            All
Representations and Covenants Deemed Borrower Responsibility. 

(1)            Any
act, action, term, condition, provision, requirement, or covenant required to be performed, or prohibited from being performed,
by Borrower under the Loan Documents including with respect to 

(A)            the
use, management or operation of the Mortgaged Property, including any licensing, repair, reporting, or insurance requirements,
and 

(B)            the
organization, existence, good standing or other entity-level requirements, shall be interpreted as requiring Borrower either to
perform such act or action directly or to cause Property Operator, a property manager or other appropriate agent to perform such
act or action. Any right or privilege assigned or delegated by Borrower or Property Operator to any other Person shall be construed
as being accompanied by each relevant obligation or restriction set forth in the Loan Documents or any Facility Operating Agreement,
as applicable. 

Article 6  

(C)            In
each instance that Borrower makes, or in the future renews or is deemed to renew, a representation, warranty, or covenant in this
Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents regarding the condition, knowledge, acts, or omissions of Property Operator or any Property
Operator Business Information, or the condition of the Mortgaged Property, Borrower does and shall do so with full knowledge, after
due inquiry (including the due inquiry of and by Guarantor), of such information. Any reporting or compliance delay caused by Property
Operator or Guarantor shall not excuse Borrower s timely performance of the terms of this Loan Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower s reliance upon incorrect or incomplete information received from
Property Operator or Guarantor and the reporting of the same to Lender, whether or not Borrower had actual knowledge that such
information was incorrect or incomplete and whether or not Borrower is otherwise in violation of the terms of this Loan Agreement,
shall not be (and none of Borrower, Property Operator, Guarantor, nor Key Principal shall assert) a defense to Lender s determination
that an Event of Default has occurred or that Borrower (or Guarantor) has incurred personal liability as set forth in Article 3
of this Loan Agreement. 

Section
6.03          Mortgage Loan Administration Matters Regarding the Property. 

(a)            Property
Management. 

If, in connection with
the making of the Mortgage Loan, or at any later date, Lender waives in writing the requirement for a written contract for the
operation or management of the Mortgaged Property, and Borrower later elects to enter into a written contract or change the operation
or management of the Mortgaged Property, such new Property Operator and any Facility Operating Agreement must be approved by Lender.
As a condition to any approval by Lender, Borrower and such new Property Operator shall enter into a SASA. 

(b)            Subordination
of Fees by Property Operator. 

All fees due to an Affiliated
Property Operator in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right to the
prior payment in full of the Indebtedness. All fees due to a non-Affiliated Property Operator in connection with the operation
and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of monthly debt
service and funding of escrows and reserves as required under the Mortgage Loan Documents, and the payment of all operating expenses
and capital expenditures incurred in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

Article 6  

(c)            Property
Condition Assessment. 

If, in connection with
any inspection of the Mortgaged Property, Lender determines that the condition of the Mortgaged Property has deteriorated (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) since the Effective Date, Lender may obtain, at Borrower s expense, a property condition assessment
of the Mortgaged Property. Lender s right to obtain a property condition assessment pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) shall
be in addition to any other rights available to Lender under this Loan Agreement in connection with any such deterioration. Any
such inspection or property condition assessment may result in Lender requiring Additional Lender Repairs or Additional Lender
Replacements as further described in Section 13.02(a)(9)(B). 

Article
7  - LEASES AND RENTS 

Section
7.01           Representations and Warranties. 

The representations and
warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 7.01 are made as of the Effective Date and are true and correct except as
disclosed on the Exceptions to Representations and Warranties Schedule. 

(a)            Prior
Assignment of Rents. 

Borrower has not executed
any: 

(1)            prior
assignment of Rents (other than an assignment of Rents securing prior indebtedness that has been paid off and discharged or will
be paid off and discharged with the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan); or 

(2)            instrument
which would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument, or the SASA. 

(b)            Prepaid
Rents. 

Borrower has not accepted,
and does not expect to receive prepayment of, any Rents for one (1) month for the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or more than two
(2) months under any other Lease prior to the due dates of such Rents. 

(c)            Seniors
Housing Facility Lease. 

(1)            The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease is in full force and effect and there is neither a default thereunder nor any condition that, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder. No right or claim of rescission, offset,
abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim has been asserted with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease, and there
is no existing condition that, with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would result in a right or claim of rescission,
offset, abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim under the terms and provisions of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower
has performed and discharged all of the obligations on the part of Borrower to be performed and discharged pursuant to the terms
set forth in the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. 

Article 6  

(2)            The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has not been modified, amended or supplemented by either party thereto. The Property Operator has
not been released, in whole or in part, from any of its obligations under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. There has been no
prior sale, transfer, assignment, hypothecation, or pledge of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease (other than in connection with
the Loan Documents) that is outstanding. 

(3)            The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has an original term ending on or after the date ninety (90) days after the Maturity Date. Absent
Lender s direction, the Property Operator cannot terminate the Seniors Housing Facility Lease for any reason prior to the
payment in full of the Indebtedness. 

(4)            There
is no free rent, partial rent or rebate of rent required to be given by Borrower to Property Operator under the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease. The Seniors Housing Facility Lease does not permit Property Operator to accept, and Property Operator has not accepted,
prepayment of Rents more than two (2) months in advance (and Borrower has not accepted prepayment of Rents more than one (1) month
in advance with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease). Each payment due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease is sufficient
to pay the Debt Service Amounts (including Monthly Debt Service Payments, Taxes, Impositions, and any Replacement Reserve Deposits)
in full on or prior to the due date thereof (without giving effect to any applicable grace periods) currently and throughout the
term of the Mortgage Loan. Payments due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease are payable without notice or demand, and without
setoff, recoupment, abatement, or reduction. 

(5)            Property
Operator has no right or option pursuant to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any part of the
Mortgaged Property, the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises are a part. 

(6)            The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease contains customary and enforceable provisions that render the rights and remedies of Borrower adequate
for the enforcement and satisfaction of the Borrower s rights thereunder. 

(7)            Borrower
represents and warrants that it is the express intent of Borrower and Property Operator that the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
constitute a lease under applicable real property laws and laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency, and creditors  rights generally,
and that the sole interest of Property Operator in the Mortgaged Property is as a tenant under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease.
The Seniors Housing Facility Lease is not intended to be deemed a guaranty.

(a)            Leases.

the terms of any non-Material Commercial Lease (including any non-Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective Date)
in any way that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to such non-Material Commercial Lease in
effect as of the Effective Date, reduces the number or size of residential units at the Mortgaged Property, or results in such
non-Material Commercial Lease being deemed a Material Commercial Lease.

respect to any Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall cause the applicable tenant to provide
within ten (10) days after a request by Borrower, a certificate of estoppel, or if not provided by tenant within such ten (10)
day period, Borrower shall provide such certificate of estoppel, certifying: 

(A)            that

of default) under such Lease; 

(F)            the
address to which notices to tenant should be sent; and 

(G)            any

(2)            interfere
with Lender s collection of such Rents. 

(e)            Further
Assignments of Leases and Rents. 

Borrower shall execute
and deliver any further assignments of Leases and Rents as Lender may reasonably require, and shall require Property Operator to
execute and deliver any corresponding assignments in support thereof. 

(f)            Options
to Purchase by Tenants.

and the other Loan Documents, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof, and to all
advances which may hereafter be made pursuant to the Note, this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents
(including all sums advanced for the purposes of (1) protecting or further securing the lien of the Security Instrument, curing

(4)            the
tenant agrees to execute such further evidences of attornment as Lender or any purchaser at a Foreclosure Event may from time to
time request; and

(b)            Residential
Lease Form. 

All Residential Leases
entered into from and after the Effective Date shall be on forms approved by Lender. Any Lease entered into by Property Operator

under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. 

(c)            Seniors
Housing Facility Lease Structure Consideration.

MAY LATER CANCEL ANY INSURANCE PURCHASED BY LENDER, BUT ONLY AFTER PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT BORROWER HAS OBTAINED INSURANCE AS REQUIRED
BY THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. 

Article 9  

(b)            Application
of Proceeds on Event of Loss. 

(1)            Upon
an event of loss, Lender may, at Lender s option: 

(A)            hold
such proceeds to be applied to reimburse Borrower for the cost of Restoration (in accordance with Lender s then-current policies
relating to the restoration of casualty damage on similar multifamily residential properties); or 

(B)            apply
such proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness, whether or not then due;  provided ,  however , Lender shall not apply
insurance proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness and shall permit Restoration pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(1)(A) if all of
the following conditions are met: 

(i)            no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or any event which, with the giving of written notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); 

(ii)            Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(iii)            Lender
determines that the net operating income generated by the Mortgaged Property after completion of the Restoration will be sufficient
to support a debt service coverage ratio not less than the debt service coverage ratio immediately prior to the event of loss,
but in no event less than 1.0x (the debt service coverage ratio shall be calculated on a thirty (30) year amortizing basis (if
applicable, on a   proforma   basis approved by Lender) in all events and shall include payments due from any Operator
under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease and all operating costs and other expenses, Imposition Deposits, deposits to Collateral
Accounts, and Mortgage Loan repayment obligations); 

(iv)            Lender
determines that the Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (1) one year before the stated Maturity Date, or (2) one
year after the date of the loss or casualty; and 

(v)            Borrower
provides Lender, upon written request, evidence of the availability during and after the Restoration of the insurance required
to be maintained pursuant to this Loan Agreement. 

After the completion of Restoration
in accordance with the above requirements, as determined by Lender, the balance, if any, of such proceeds shall be returned to
Borrower. 

Article 9  

(2)            Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any loss is estimated to be in an amount equal to or less than $50,000, Lender shall not exercise its rights
and remedies as power-of-attorney herein and shall allow Borrower to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any claims under
policies of property damage insurance, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such policies of property damage insurance,
and to collect and receive the proceeds of property damage insurance; provided that each of the following conditions shall be satisfied: 

(A)            Borrower
shall immediately notify Lender of the casualty giving rise to the claim; 

(B)            no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or any event which, with the giving of written notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); 

(C)            the
Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (i) one year before the stated Maturity Date or (ii) one year after the date
of the loss or casualty; 

(D)            Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(E)            all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be issued in the form of joint checks to Borrower and Lender; 

(F)            all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be applied to the Restoration; 

(G)            Borrower
shall deliver to Lender evidence satisfactory to Lender of completion of the Restoration and obtainment of all lien releases; 

(H)            Borrower
shall have complied to Lender s satisfaction with the foregoing requirements on any prior claims subject to this provision,
if any; and 

(I)            Lender
shall have the right to inspect the Mortgaged Property (subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases, other than the Seniors
Housing Facility Lease). 

Article 9  

(3)            If
Lender elects to apply insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall
not be obligated to restore or repair the Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to the damaged portion of
the Mortgaged Property and, at its expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by insurance, clean up any debris resulting
from the casualty event, and, if required or otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining part of the damaged
Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable, and marketable condition.
Nothing in this Section 9.03(b) shall affect any of Lender s remedial rights against Borrower in connection with a breach
by Borrower of any of its obligations under this Loan Agreement or under any Loan Document, including any failure to timely pay
Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain the insurance coverage(s) required by this Loan Agreement. 

(c)            Payment
Obligations Unaffected. 

The application of any
insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness shall not extend or postpone the Maturity Date, or the due date or the full payment of any
Monthly Debt Service Payment, Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, or any other installments referred to in this Loan Agreement
or in any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lender applies insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in connection
with a casualty of less than the entire Mortgaged Property, and after such application of proceeds the debt service coverage ratio
(as determined by Lender) is less than 1.25x based on the then-applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment and the anticipated on-going
net operating income of the Mortgaged Property after such casualty event, then Lender may, at its discretion, permit an adjustment
to the Monthly Debt Service Payments that become due and owing thereafter, based on Lender s then-current underwriting requirements.
In no event shall the preceding sentence obligate Lender to make any adjustment to the Monthly Debt Service Payments. 

(d)            Foreclosure
Sale. 

If the Mortgaged Property
is transferred pursuant to a Foreclosure Event or Lender otherwise acquires title to the Mortgaged Property, Borrower acknowledges
that Lender shall automatically succeed to all rights of Borrower in and to any insurance policies and unearned insurance premiums
applicable to the Mortgaged Property and in and to the proceeds resulting from any damage to the Mortgaged Property prior to such
Foreclosure Event or such acquisition. 

(e)            Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby authorizes
and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c).

of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby authorizes
and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c). 

(d)            Preservation
of Mortgaged Property. 

If a Condemnation Action
results in or from damage to the Mortgaged Property and Lender elects to apply the proceeds or awards from such Condemnation Action
to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall not be obligated to restore or repair the
Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to any portion of the Mortgaged Property which has been damaged or destroyed
in connection with such Condemnation Action and, at Borrower s expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by
insurance, clean up any debris resulting in or from the Condemnation Action, and, if required by any Governmental Authority or
otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining part of the damaged Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to
keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable, and marketable condition. Nothing in this Section 10.03(d) shall
affect any of Lender s remedial rights against Borrower in connection with a breach by Borrower of any of its obligations
under this Loan Agreement or under any Loan Document, including any failure to timely pay Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain
the insurance coverage(s) required by this Loan Agreement.

Section
12.02        Covenants. 

(a)            Imposition
Deposits, Taxes, and Other Charges. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)            deposit
the Imposition Deposits with Lender on each Payment Date (or on another day designated in writing by Lender) in amount sufficient,
in Lender s discretion, to enable Lender to pay each Imposition before the last date upon which such payment may be made
without any penalty or interest charge being added, plus an amount equal to no more than one-sixth (1/6) (or the amount permitted
by applicable law) of the Impositions for the trailing twelve (12) months (calculated based on the aggregate annual Imposition
costs divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by two (2)); 

Article 12  

(2)            deposit

of Records by Lender. 

Lender shall maintain records
of the monthly and aggregate Imposition Deposits held by Lender for the purpose of paying Taxes, insurance premiums, and each other
obligation of Borrower for which Imposition Deposits are required. 

(b)            Imposition
Accounts. 

All Imposition Deposits
shall be held in an institution (which may be Lender, if Lender is such an institution) whose deposits or accounts are insured
or guaranteed by a federal agency and which accounts meet the standards for custodial accounts as required by Lender from time
to time. Lender shall not be obligated to open additional accounts, or deposit Imposition Deposits in additional institutions,
when the amount of the Imposition Deposits exceeds the maximum amount of the federal deposit insurance or guaranty. No interest,
earnings, or profits on the Imposition Deposits shall be paid to Borrower unless applicable law so requires. Imposition Deposits
shall not be trust funds, nor shall they operate to reduce the Indebtedness, unless applied by Lender for that purpose in accordance
with this Loan Agreement. For the purposes of 9-104(a)(3) of the UCC, Lender is the owner of the Imposition Deposits and shall
be deemed a  customer  with sole control of the account holding the Imposition Deposits. 

Article 12

of Impositions; Sufficiency of Imposition Deposits. 

Lender may pay an Imposition
according to any bill, statement, or estimate from the appropriate public office or insurance company without inquiring into the
accuracy of the bill, statement, or estimate or into the validity of the Imposition. Imposition Deposits shall be required to be
used by Lender to pay Taxes, insurance premiums and any other individual Imposition only if: 

(1)            no
Event of Default exists; 

(2)            Borrower
has timely delivered to Lender all applicable bills or premium notices that it has received; and 

(3)            sufficient
Imposition Deposits are held by Lender for each Imposition at the time such Imposition becomes due and payable. 

Lender shall have no liability
to Borrower or any other Person for failing to pay any Imposition if any of the conditions are not satisfied. If at any time the
amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment of a specific Imposition exceeds the amount reasonably deemed necessary by Lender
to be held in connection with such Imposition, the excess may be credited against future installments of Imposition Deposits for
such Imposition. 

(d)            Imposition
Deposits Upon Event of Default. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Lender may apply any Imposition Deposits, in such amount and in such order as Lender determines,
to pay any Impositions or as a credit against the Indebtedness. 

(e)            Contesting
Impositions. 

Other than insurance premiums,
Borrower may contest, at its expense, by appropriate legal proceedings, the amount or validity of any Imposition if: 

(1)            Borrower
notifies Lender of the commencement or expected commencement of such proceedings; 

(2)            Lender
determines that the Mortgaged Property is not in danger of being sold or forfeited; 

(3)            Borrower
deposits with Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority if required by applicable law) reserves sufficient to pay the contested
Imposition, if required by Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority); 

(4)            Borrower
furnishes whatever additional security is required in the proceedings or is reasonably requested in writing by Lender; and 

(5)            Borrower
commences, and at all times thereafter diligently prosecutes, such contest in good faith until a final determination is made by
the applicable Governmental Authority. 

Article 12  

(f)            Release
to Borrower.

all sums secured by the Security Instrument and this Loan Agreement and release by Lender of the lien of the Security Instrument,
Lender shall disburse to Borrower the balance of any Imposition Deposits then on deposit with Lender.

shall indemnify and hold Lender harmless for, from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses,
damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, arising from or in
any way connected with the performance by Lender of the Replacements or Repairs or investment of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds;
provided that Borrower shall have no indemnity obligation if such actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages,
obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, arise as a result of the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of Lender, Lender s agents, employees, or representatives as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

(f)            Amendments
to Loan Documents. 

Subject to Section 5.02,
Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender, upon written request, an amendment to this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument,
and any other Loan Document deemed necessary or desirable to perfect Lender s lien upon any portion of the Mortgaged Property

Fees and Expenses.

(2)            upon
demand, a reasonable inspection fee, not exceeding the Maximum Inspection Fee, for each inspection of the Mortgaged Property by
Lender in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such
inspections; and 

Article 13

behalf of Lender for each inspection of the Mortgaged Property in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable
costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such inspections. 

Section
13.02        Mortgage Loan Administration Matters Regarding Reserves. 

(a)            Accounts,
Deposits, and Disbursements. 

(1)              Custodial
Accounts.  

(A)            The
Replacement Reserve Account shall be an interest-bearing account that meets the standards for custodial accounts as required by
Lender from time to time. Lender shall not be responsible for any losses resulting from the investment of the Replacement Reserve
Deposits or for obtaining any specific level or percentage of earnings on such investment. All interest, if any, earned on the
Replacement Reserve Deposits shall be added to and become part of the Replacement Reserve Account;  provided ,  however ,
if applicable law requires, and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents,
Lender shall pay to Borrower the interest earned on the Replacement Reserve Account not less frequently than the Replacement Reserve
Account Interest Disbursement Frequency. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the Reserve/Escrow Account
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

(B)            Lender
shall not be obligated to deposit the Repairs Escrow Deposits into an interest-bearing account. 

(2)              Disbursements
by Lender Only.  

Only Lender or
a designated representative of Lender may make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account and the Repairs Escrow Account.
Except as provided in Section 13.02(a)(8), disbursements shall only be made upon Borrower request and after satisfaction of all
conditions for disbursement. 

Article 13  

(3)              Adjustment
to Deposits.  

(A)             Mortgage
Loan Terms Exceeding Ten (10) Years.  

If the Loan Term
exceeds ten (10) years (or five (5) years in the case of any Mortgaged Property that is an  affordable housing property 
as indicated on the Summary of Loan Terms), a property condition assessment shall be ordered by Lender for the Mortgaged Property
at the expense of Borrower (which expense may be paid out of the Replacement Reserve Account if excess funds are available). The
property condition assessment shall be performed no earlier than the sixth (6th) month and no later than the ninth (9th) month
of the tenth (10th) Loan Year and every tenth (10th) Loan Year thereafter if the Loan Term exceeds twenty (20) years (or the fifth
(5th) Loan Year in the case of any Mortgaged Property that is an  affordable housing property  as indicated on the
Summary of Loan Terms and every fifth (5th) Loan Year thereafter if the Loan Term exceeds ten (10) years). After review of the
property condition assessment, the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit may be adjusted by Lender for the remaining
Loan Term by written notice to Borrower so that the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposits are sufficient to fund the Replacements
as and when required and/or the amount to be held in the Repairs Escrow Account may be adjusted by Lender so that the Repairs Escrow
Deposit is sufficient to fund the Repairs as and when required. 

(B)             Transfers.  

In connection with
any Transfer of the Mortgaged Property, the Facility Operating Agreement, or any Transfer of an ownership interest in Borrower,
Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal that requires Lender s consent, Lender may review the amounts on
deposit, if any, in the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve
Deposit and the likely repairs and replacements required by the Mortgaged Property, and the related contingencies which may arise
during the remaining Loan Term. Based upon that review, Lender may require an additional deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account
or the Repairs Escrow Account, or an increase in the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit as a condition to Lender s
consent to such Transfer. 

(4)              Insufficient
Funds.  

Lender may, upon

making of such Replacements or Repairs, Lender shall have the right to enter onto the Mortgaged Property and perform any and all
work and labor necessary to make or complete the Replacements or Repairs and employ watchmen to protect the Mortgaged Property

(e)            No

Section
14.02        Remedies. 

(a)            Acceleration;
Foreclosure. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, any Accrued Interest, interest accruing
at the Default Rate, the Prepayment Premium (if applicable), and all other Indebtedness, at the option of Lender, shall immediately
become due and payable, without any prior written notice to Borrower, unless applicable law requires otherwise (and in such case,
after any required written notice has been given). Lender may exercise this option to accelerate regardless of any prior forbearance.
In addition, Lender shall have all rights and remedies afforded to Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, including,
foreclosure on and/or the power of sale of the Mortgaged Property, as provided in the Security Instrument, and any rights and remedies
available to Lender at law or in equity (subject to Borrower s statutory rights of reinstatement, if any). Any proceeds of
a Foreclosure Event may be held and applied by Lender as additional collateral for the Indebtedness pursuant to this Loan Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event shall automatically accelerate the Mortgage Loan and all
obligations and Indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable without written notice or further action by Lender. 

(b)            Loss
of Right to Disbursements from Collateral Accounts.

Accounts and any Collateral Accounts. During the continuance of any such Event of Default, Lender may use the Reserve/Escrow Account
Funds and any Collateral Account Funds (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including: 

(1)            repayment
of the Indebtedness, including principal prepayments and the Prepayment Premium applicable to such full or partial prepayment,
as applicable (however, such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default); 

(2)            reimbursement
of Lender for all losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event
of Default; 

Article 14  

(3)            completion
of the Replacement or Repair or for any other replacement or repair to the Mortgaged Property; and 

(4)            payment
of any amount expended in exercising (and the exercise of) all rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under
this Loan Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents. 

Nothing in this Loan Agreement shall obligate
Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds or Collateral Account Funds on account of any Event of Default
or to repayment of the Indebtedness or in any specific order of priority. 

(c)            Remedies
Cumulative. 

Each right and remedy provided
in this Loan Agreement is distinct from all other rights or remedies under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or afforded
by applicable law, and each shall be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently, independently, or successively, in any order.
Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of additional default by
Borrower in order to exercise any of its remedies with respect to an Event of Default. 

(d)            Operations
upon Event of Default; Lockbox Account. 

(1)            If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: 

(A)            Borrower
shall or shall cause each Property Operator to, at the option of Lender, continue to provide all necessary services required under
each Facility Operating Agreement or applicable licensing or regulatory requirements to operate and manage the Mortgaged Property
as a Seniors Housing Facility and shall fully cooperate with Lender and any receiver as may be appointed by a court, in performing
these services and agrees to arrange for an orderly transition to a replacement property operator or provider of the necessary
services, and to execute promptly all applications, assignments, consents, and documents requested by Lender to facilitate such
transition; and 

(B)            Lender
may cause the removal of Borrower or any Property Operator (as applicable) from any Mortgaged Property operations. Until such time
as Lender has located a replacement property operator, Borrower or the acting Property Operator shall continue to provide all required
services to maintain the Mortgaged Property in full compliance with all License and regulatory requirements. Borrower acknowledges
that its failure to perform or to cause the performance of this service shall constitute a form of waste of the Mortgaged Property,
causing irreparable harm to Lender and the Mortgaged Property, and shall constitute sufficient cause for the appointment of a receiver. 

Article 14  

(2)            In
addition to the remedies set forth herein and elsewhere in the Loan Documents, upon an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled
to mandate the use of a lockbox bank account or other depositary account, to be maintained under the control and supervision of
Lender, for all income of the Mortgaged Property, including Rents, service charges, insurance payments, and Third Party Payments. 

Section
14.03        Additional Lender Rights; Forbearance. 

(a)            No
Effect Upon Obligations. 

Lender may, but shall not
be obligated to, agree with Borrower, from time to time, and without giving notice to, or obtaining the consent of, or having any
effect upon the obligations of, any Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or other third party obligor, to take any of the
following actions: 

(1)            the
time for payment of the principal of or interest on the Indebtedness may be extended, or the Indebtedness may be renewed in whole
or in part; 

(2)            the
rate of interest on or period of amortization of the Mortgage Loan or the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payments payable under
the Loan Documents may be modified; 

(3)            the
time for Borrower s performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document, whether presently
existing or hereinafter entered into, may be extended or such performance or compliance may be waived; 

(4)            any
or all payments due under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document may be reduced; 

(5)            any
Loan Document may be modified or amended by Lender and Borrower in any respect, including an increase in the principal amount of
the Mortgage Loan; 

(6)            any
amounts under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document may be released; 

(7)            any
security for the Indebtedness may be modified, exchanged, released, surrendered, or otherwise dealt with, or additional security
may be pledged or mortgaged for the Indebtedness; 

(8)            the
payment of the Indebtedness or any security for the Indebtedness, or both, may be subordinated to the right to payment or the security,
or both, of any other present or future creditor of Borrower; or 

(9)            any
other terms of the Loan Documents may be modified. 

Article 14  

(b)            No
Waiver of Rights or Remedies. 

Any waiver of an Event
of Default or forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise
afforded by applicable law, shall not be a waiver of any other Event of Default or preclude the exercise or failure to exercise
of any other right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness after the due date of
such payment, or in an amount which is less than the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender s right to require
prompt payment when due of all other payments on account of the Indebtedness or to exercise any remedies for any failure to make
prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any security for the Indebtedness shall not constitute an election by Lender of remedies
so as to preclude the exercise or failure to exercise of any other right available to Lender. Lender s receipt of any insurance
proceeds or amounts in connection with a Condemnation Action shall not operate to cure or waive any Event of Default. 

(c)            Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby irrevocably
makes, constitutes, and appoints Lender (and any officer of Lender or any Person designated by Lender for that purpose) as Borrower s
true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact (and agent-in-fact) in Borrower s name, place, and stead, with full power of substitution,
to: 

(1)            use
any of the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account for the purpose of making or completing the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(2)            make
such additions, changes, and corrections to the Replacements or Repairs as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(3)            employ
such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects, and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; 

(4)            pay,
settle, or compromise all bills and claims for materials and work performed in connection with the Replacements or Repairs, or
as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Replacements or Repairs, or for clearance of title; 

(5)            adjust
and compromise any claims under any and all policies of insurance required pursuant to this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Document,
subject only to Borrower s rights under this Loan Agreement; 

(6)            appear
in and prosecute any action arising from any insurance policies; 

(7)            collect
and receive the proceeds of insurance, and to deduct from such proceeds Lender s expenses incurred in the collection of such
proceeds; 

Article 14  

(8)            commence,
appear in, and prosecute, in Lender s or Borrower s name, any Condemnation Action; 

(9)            settle
or compromise any claim in connection with any Condemnation Action; 

(10)            execute
all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; 

(11)            prosecute
and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Mortgaged Property or the rehabilitation and repair of the Mortgaged
Property; 

(12)            take
such actions as are permitted in this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Documents; 

(13)            execute
such financing statements and other documents and to do such other acts as Lender may require to perfect and preserve Lender s
security interest in, and to enforce such interests in, the collateral; and 

(14)            carry
out any remedy provided for in this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Documents, including endorsing Borrower s name to checks,
drafts, instruments and other items of payment and proceeds of the collateral, executing change of address forms with the postmaster
of the United States Post Office serving the address of Borrower, changing the address of Borrower to that of Lender, opening all
envelopes addressed to Borrower, and applying any payments contained therein to the Indebtedness. 

Borrower hereby acknowledges that
the constitution and appointment of such proxy and attorney-in-fact are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable and shall
not be affected by the disability or incompetence of Borrower. Borrower specifically acknowledges and agrees that this power of
attorney granted to Lender may be assigned by Lender to Lender s successors or assigns as holder of the Note (and the other
Loan Documents). The foregoing powers conferred on Lender under this Section 14.03(c) shall not impose any duty upon Lender to
exercise any such powers and shall not require Lender to incur any expense or take any action. Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms
all that such attorney-in-fact may do or cause to be done by virtue of any provision of this Loan Agreement and any other Loan
Documents. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions,
Lender shall not exercise its rights as set forth in this Section 14.03(c) unless: (A) an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, or (B) Lender determines, in its discretion, that exigent circumstances exist or that such exercise is necessary or
prudent in order to protect and preserve the Mortgaged Property, or Lender s lien priority and security interest in the Mortgaged
Property. 

Article 14  

(d)            Borrower
Waivers. 

If more than one Person
signs this Loan Agreement as Borrower, each Borrower, with respect to any other Borrower, hereby agrees that Lender, in its discretion,
may: 

(1)            bring
suit against Borrower, or any one or more of Borrower, jointly and severally, or against any one or more of them; 

(2)            compromise
or settle with any one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, for such consideration as Lender may deem proper; 

(3)            release
one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, from liability; or 

(4)            otherwise
deal with Borrower, or any one or more of them, in any manner, and no such action shall impair the rights of Lender to collect
from any Borrower the full amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section
14.04         Waiver of Marshaling. 

Notwithstanding the existence
of any other security interests in the Mortgaged Property held by Lender or by any other party, Lender shall have the right to
determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged Property shall be subjected to the remedies provided in this Loan Agreement,
any other Loan Document or applicable law. Lender shall have the right to determine the order in which all or any part of the Indebtedness
is satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of such remedies. Borrower and any party who now or in the future acquires
a security interest in the Mortgaged Property and who has actual or constructive notice of this Loan Agreement waives any and all
right to require the marshaling of assets or to require that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in the inverse order of alienation
or that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in parcels or as an entirety in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies
permitted by applicable law or provided in this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Documents. 

Lender shall account for
any moneys received by Lender in respect of any foreclosure on or disposition of collateral hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents provided that Lender shall not have any duty as to any collateral, and Lender shall be accountable only for amounts that
it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers. NONE OF LENDER OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO BORROWER (a) FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE,
EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE SOLELY TO THEIR OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS FINALLY DETERMINED PURSUANT
TO A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE COURT ORDER BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, NOR (b) FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES.

(b)            Venue. 

Any controversy arising
under or in relation to this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be litigated exclusively in the Property Jurisdiction
without regard to conflicts of laws principles. The state and federal courts and authorities with jurisdiction in the Property
Jurisdiction shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all controversies which shall arise under or in relation to this Loan Agreement
or any other Loan Document. Borrower irrevocably consents to service, jurisdiction, and venue of such courts for any such litigation
and waives any other venue to which it might be entitled by virtue of domicile, habitual residence, or otherwise.

Article 15  

(B)            if

by the records of the United States Postal Service or such express courier service. 

(b)            Change

Any party to this Loan
Agreement may change the address to which notices intended for it are to be directed by means of notice given to the other parties

Operator Notices. 

Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that Borrower solely shall be responsible for (1) causing Property Operator to comply with any notice received by Borrower
from Lender, and (2) promptly providing Lender with copies of notices received by Borrower from Property Operator. Borrower s
compliance with or failure to act as an intermediary as described in this Section 15.02(e) shall not relieve Borrower from its
obligations under this Loan Agreement, nor shall it constitute a defense or excuse for nonperformance by Borrower, Property Operator,
or any Guarantor, as applicable. Lender shall have no obligation to provide any notice to Property Operator unless and until Lender
has taken ownership or control of the Mortgaged Property, or in connection with Lender s exercise of the power of attorney
granted herein, and then only as required by the Loan Documents or the Facility Operating Agreement. 

Section
15.03        Successors and Assigns Bound; Sale of Mortgage Loan. 

(a)            Binding
Agreement. 

This Loan Agreement shall
bind, and the rights granted by this Loan Agreement shall inure to, the successors and assigns of Lender and the permitted successors
and assigns of Borrower. However, a Transfer not permitted by this Loan Agreement shall be an Event of Default and shall be void
ab initio. 

Article 15  

(b)            Sale
of Mortgage Loan; Change of Servicer. 

Nothing in this Loan Agreement
shall limit Lender s (including its successors and assigns) right to sell or transfer the Mortgage Loan or any interest in
the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan or a partial interest in the Mortgage Loan (together with this Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents) may be sold one or more times without prior written notice to Borrower. A sale may result in a change of the Loan
Servicer. 

Section
15.04         Counterparts. 

This Loan Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the parties hereto had signed the same document and all such

Section
15.06        Relationship of Parties; No Third Party Beneficiary. 

(a)            Solely
Creditor and Debtor. 

The relationship between
Lender and Borrower shall be solely that of creditor and debtor, respectively, and nothing contained in this Loan Agreement shall
create any other relationship between Lender and Borrower, nor between Lender and Property Operator. Nothing contained in this
Loan Agreement shall constitute Lender as a joint venturer, partner, or agent of Borrower or Property Operator, or render Lender
liable for any debts, obligations, acts, omissions, representations, or contracts of Borrower or Property Operator. 

(b)            No
Third Party Beneficiaries.

to this Loan Agreement and no other Person shall be a third party beneficiary of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document
or any account created or contemplated under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document. Nothing contained in this Loan Agreement
shall be deemed or construed to create an obligation on the part of Lender to any third party nor shall any third party have a
right to enforce against Lender any right that Borrower may have under this Loan Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing: 

(1)            any
Servicing Arrangement between Lender and any Loan Servicer shall constitute a contractual obligation of such Loan Servicer that
is independent of the obligation of Borrower for the payment of the Indebtedness; 

(2)            Borrower
shall not be a third party beneficiary of any Servicing Arrangement; and 

Article 15  

(3)            no
payment by the Loan Servicer under any Servicing Arrangement will reduce the amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section
15.07        Severability; Entire Agreement; Amendments. 

The invalidity or unenforceability
of any provision of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, all of which shall remain in full force and effect, including the
Guaranty. This Loan Agreement contains the complete and entire agreement among the parties as to the matters covered, rights granted,
and the obligations assumed in this Loan Agreement. This Loan Agreement may not be amended or modified except by written agreement
signed by the parties hereto. 

Section

captions and headings of the sections of this Loan Agreement and the Loan Documents are for convenience only and shall be disregarded
in construing this Loan Agreement and the Loan Documents. 

(b)            Any
reference in this Loan Agreement to an  Exhibit  or  Schedule  or a  Section  or an  Article 
shall, unless otherwise explicitly provided, be construed as referring, respectively, to an Exhibit or Schedule attached to this
Loan Agreement or to a Section or Article of this Loan Agreement. 

(c)            Any
reference in this Loan Agreement to a statute or regulation shall be construed as referring to that statute or regulation as amended
from time to time.

of the singular in this Loan Agreement includes the plural and use of the plural includes the singular. 

(e)            As
used in this Loan Agreement, the term  including  means  including, but not limited to  or  including,
without limitation,  and is for example only and not a limitation. 

(f)            Whenever
Borrower s knowledge is implicated in this Loan Agreement or the phrase  to Borrower s knowledge  or a
similar phrase is used in this Loan Agreement, Borrower s knowledge or such phrase(s) shall be interpreted to mean to the
best of Borrower s knowledge after reasonable and diligent inquiry and investigation. 

(g)            Unless
otherwise provided in this Loan Agreement, if Lender s approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate, action,
or decision is required, permitted, or contemplated hereunder, such approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate,
action or decision shall be made in Lender s sole and absolute discretion. 

Article 15  

(h)            All
references in this Loan Agreement to a separate instrument or agreement shall include such instrument or agreement as the same
may be amended or supplemented from time to time pursuant to the applicable provisions thereof. 

(i)             Lender
may  shall mean at Lender s discretion, but shall not be an obligation. 

(j)            If
the Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed on a date that is later than the Effective Date, as described in Section 2.02(a)(1), the
representations and warranties in the Loan Documents with respect to the ownership and operation of the Mortgaged Property shall
be deemed to be made as of the disbursement date. 

(k)            Any
references in this Loan Agreement to a Senior Housing Facility shall refer to the Mortgaged Property identified on the Summary
of Loan Terms including the Seniors Housing Facility Licensing Designation. 

(l)            Each
reference to  tenant  or  tenants  in the Loan Documents shall be interpreted to mean  subtenant 
or  subtenants  where the context so indicates. 

Section
15.09        Mortgage Loan Servicing. 

All actions regarding the
servicing of the Mortgage Loan, including the collection of payments, the giving and receipt of notice, inspections of the Mortgaged
Property, inspections of books and records, and the granting of consents and approvals, may be taken by the Loan Servicer unless
Borrower receives notice to the contrary. If Borrower receives conflicting notices regarding the identity of the Loan Servicer
or any other subject, any such written notice from Lender shall govern. The Loan Servicer may change from time to time (whether
related or unrelated to a sale of the Mortgage Loan). If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written
notice of the change. 

Section
15.10        Disclosure of Information. 

Lender may furnish information
regarding Borrower, Property Operator, Key Principal, Guarantor, or the Mortgaged Property to third parties with an existing or
prospective interest in the servicing, enforcement, evaluation, performance, purchase, or securitization of the Mortgage Loan,
including trustees, master servicers, special servicers, rating agencies, and organizations maintaining databases on the underwriting
and performance of multifamily mortgage loans. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all rights it may have under applicable law
to prohibit such disclosure, including any right of privacy. 

Section
15.11        Waiver; Conflict. 

No specific waiver of any
of the terms of this Loan Agreement shall be considered as a general waiver. If any provision of this Loan Agreement is in conflict
with any provision of any other Loan Document, the provision contained in this Loan Agreement shall control. 

Article 15  

Section
15.12        No Reliance. 

Borrower acknowledges,
represents, and warrants that: 

(a)            it
understands the nature and structure of the transactions contemplated by this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents; 

(b)            it
is familiar with the provisions of all of the documents and instruments relating to such transactions; 

(c)            it
understands the risks inherent in such transactions, including the risk of loss of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property; 

(d)            it
has had the opportunity to consult counsel; and 

(e)            it
has not relied on Lender for any guidance or expertise in analyzing the financial or other consequences of the transactions contemplated
by this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise relied on Lender in any manner in connection with interpreting,
entering into, or otherwise in connection with this Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any of the matters contemplated
hereby or thereby. 

Section
15.13        Subrogation. 

If, and to the extent that,
the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan are used to pay, satisfy, or discharge any obligation of Borrower or Property Operator for the
payment of money that is secured by a pre-existing mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien encumbering the Mortgaged Property, such
Mortgage Loan proceeds shall be deemed to have been advanced by Lender at Borrower s request, and Lender shall automatically,
and without further action on its part, be subrogated to the rights, including lien priority, of the owner or holder of the obligation
secured by such prior lien, whether or not such prior lien is released. 

Section
15.14        Counting of Days. 

Except where otherwise
specifically provided, any reference in this Loan Agreement to a period of  days  means calendar days, not Business
Days. If the date on which Borrower is required to perform an obligation under this Loan Agreement is not a Business Day, Borrower
shall be required to perform such obligation by the Business Day immediately preceding such date; provided, however, in respect
of any Payment Date, or if the Maturity Date is other than a Business Day, Borrower shall be obligated to make such payment by
the Business Day immediately following such date. 

Article 15  

Section 15.15       Revival
and Reinstatement of Indebtedness.  

If the payment of all or
any part of the Indebtedness by Borrower, Property Operator, any Guarantor, or any other Person, or the transfer to Lender of any
collateral or other property should for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law
relating to creditors  rights, including provisions of the Insolvency Laws relating to a Voidable Transfer, and if Lender
is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the advice of its counsel,
then the amount of such Voidable Transfer or the amount of such Voidable Transfer that Lender is required or elects to repay or
restore, including all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys  fees incurred by Lender in connection therewith, and the
Indebtedness shall be automatically revived, reinstated, and restored by such amount and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer
had never been made. 

Section
15.16        Time is of the Essence. 

Borrower agrees that, with
respect to each and every obligation and covenant contained in this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, time is of the

AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES. All prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, representations, and statements, oral or written,
are merged into this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents. This Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any of their
provisions may not be waived, modified, amended, discharged, or terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by the party
against which the enforcement of the waiver, modification, amendment, discharge, or termination is sought, and then only to the
extent set forth in that agreement.

BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF BORROWER AND LENDER (a) COVENANTS AND AGREES NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ISSUE

SUCH RIGHT EXISTS NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS SEPARATELY GIVEN BY EACH PARTY, KNOWINGLY AND

SCHEDULE 3 TO 

  MULTIFAMILY LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  

Schedule of Interest Rate Type Provisions 

 (Structured ARM (1 and 3 Month LIBOR))
and Fixed Rate Conversion Option 

1.  Defined Terms. 

Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in this Schedule have the meanings given to such terms in the Definitions Schedule to the Loan Agreement. 

2.  Interest Accrual. 

Except as otherwise provided
in the Loan Agreement, interest shall accrue at the Adjustable Rate until the Mortgage Loan is fully paid. 

3.  Adjustable Rate; Adjustments. 

The Initial Adjustable
Rate shall be effective until the first Rate Change Date. Thereafter, the Adjustable Rate shall change on each Rate Change Date
based on fluctuations in the Current Index. 

4.  Fixed Monthly Principal Component. 

Each amortizing Monthly
Debt Service Payment shall include a principal payment equal to the Fixed Monthly Principal Component, which shall be determined
using the Fixed Rate Amortization Factor. 

5.  Notification of Interest Rate Change and Monthly Debt Service
Payment. 

Before each Payment Change
Date, Lender shall notify Borrower of any change in the Adjustable Rate and the amount of the next Monthly Debt Service Payment. 

6.  Correction to Monthly Debt Service Payments. 

If Lender determines at
any time that it has miscalculated the amount of a Monthly Debt Service Payment (whether because of a miscalculation of the Adjustable
Rate or otherwise), then Lender shall give notice to Borrower of the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment (and
the corrected Adjustable Rate, if applicable) and (a) if the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents an
increase, then Borrower shall, within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, pay to Lender any sums that Borrower would have otherwise
been obligated to pay to Lender had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated, or (b) if the corrected
amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents a decrease and Borrower is not otherwise in default under any of the Loan
Documents, then Borrower shall thereafter be paid the sums that Borrower would not have otherwise been obligated to pay to Lender
had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated. 

Schedule 3  

7.  Conversion to Fixed Rate. 

(a)           Conversion Option.  

(1)           Subject
to the following terms and conditions, Borrower may exercise the Conversion Option pursuant to which the interest rate payable
on the Mortgage Loan may be converted, one (1) time only, on any Payment Date during the Conversion Period from the Adjustable
Rate to the Fixed Rate, after which the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan shall remain at the Fixed Rate until the New Maturity
Date. 

(2)           For Mortgage
Loans that are full-term interest-only, the Amortization Period from and after the Conversion Effective Date shall be three hundred
sixty (360) months. For all other Mortgage Loans, including Mortgage Loans that are partial interest-only or amortizing, the Amortization
Period from and after the Conversion Effective Date shall be: 

(A)           three hundred
sixty (360) months, if (i) Borrower selects a Fixed Rate Option having a term greater than or equal to the original term of the
Mortgage Loan from the Effective Date through the Maturity Date, and (ii) the most recent inspection of the Mortgaged Property
by Lender resulted in a rating of either  1  or  2  or 

(B)           in all other
cases, the number of months equal to (A) three hundred sixty (360) months, minus (B) the number of Monthly Debt Service Payments
that have elapsed since the Effective Date. 

(3)           The Monthly
Debt Service Payment following a Conversion shall be in an amount required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan immediately prior to the Initial Fixed Rate Payment Date in equal monthly installments, including accrued interest at the
Fixed Rate, over the Amortization Period utilizing the 30/360 Interest Accrual Method even if Actual/360 is the Interest Accrual
Method. 

(4)           The Conversion
Option shall lapse (A) at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the expiration of the Conversion Period
if Borrower has not previously delivered to Lender an NOI Determination Request in accordance with the terms of this Schedule or
(B) on the Conversion Effective Date, if the Conversion Option is timely exercised but the Fixed Rate does not become effective
on such Conversion Effective Date. 

Schedule 3  

(5)           It is
anticipated that the Conversion will be effected by the issuance by Lender of a fixed-rate MBS or by the cash purchase of the Mortgage
Loan by Lender into its portfolio (subject to the provisions of Section 7(b)(2) of this Schedule). Borrower acknowledges, however,
that the Conversion is contingent on the capital markets generally, and that from time to time, disruptions in the capital markets
may make Conversion infeasible. In the event Lender is not able to obtain any quotes for the Mortgage Loan at the Fixed Rate (and
does not make a cash bid for the Mortgage Loan), or if the quotes exceed the Maximum Fixed Rate, the interest rate on the Mortgage
Loan shall remain at the Adjustable Rate. 

(b)           Procedures for Conversion.  

(1)           NOI
Determination Request.  

(A)           Subject
to the terms of the Loan Agreement, if Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option, Borrower shall submit an NOI Determination
Request to Lender, which shall include Borrower s selection of a Fixed Rate Option. 

(B)           The NOI
Determination Request shall be accompanied by the Conversion Review Fee in the form of a check payable to Lender or by wire transfer
to an account designated by Lender. 

(C)           In no event
shall the NOI Determination Request be made prior to the commencement of the Conversion Period or less than ninety (90) days prior
to the expiration of the Conversion Period. Borrower may not submit an NOI Determination Request if an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing at the time of the request or if an Event of Default has occurred at any time within the twelve (12) month period
immediately preceding the date of Borrower s request. In addition, Borrower may not submit an NOI Determination Request more
than twice in any Loan Year. Borrower shall submit to Lender, within five (5) days after receipt of a request therefor, all information
relating to the operation of the Mortgaged Property required by Lender to determine the Net Operating Income and Borrower s
compliance with Section 7 of this Schedule. If Borrower fails to provide such information within such period, Borrower s
NOI Determination Request shall be deemed canceled (however, such canceled NOI Determination Request shall count as a request for
the Loan Year in which the request was made). 

Schedule 3  

(2)           Conversion
Eligibility Determination.  

(A)           Within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of an NOI Determination Request (or, if Lender requests additional information from Borrower pursuant to
Section 7(b)(2)(B) of this Schedule, within fifteen (15) days after Lender s receipt of such additional information), Lender
shall determine the Net Operating Income of the Mortgaged Property and the Maximum Fixed Rate to which the Mortgage Loan may be
converted and shall provide Borrower with the NOI Determination Notice. 

(B)           Lender shall
determine the Net Operating Income for the trailing twelve (12) month period on the basis of the most recently received quarterly
financial statements (as such statements may be adjusted by Lender as necessary to accurately reflect items of income, operating
expenses, ground lease payments, if applicable, and replacement reserves to reflect suitable underwriting) prepared by Borrower
for the Mortgaged Property. In connection with any request by Lender for additional information, Borrower shall have five (5) days
after Borrower s receipt of such request to provide Lender with such additional information. 

(C)           Borrower
may not exercise the Conversion Option unless Lender determines that, based upon the Net Operating Income set forth in the NOI
Determination Notice and the Fixed Rate quoted in connection with a Rate Lock Request, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
Mortgaged Property is equal to or greater than the Minimum Conversion Debt Service Coverage Ratio. 

(3)           Exercise
of Conversion Option; Rate Lock Request.  

(A)           If, after
receipt of the NOI Determination Notice, Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option, Borrower shall, within fifteen (15)
days of Borrower s receipt of the NOI Determination Notice: 

(i)           provide
Lender with a title report for the Mortgaged Property prepared by, or by an agent for, the issuer of the Title Policy, showing
marketable fee simple or leasehold title to the Mortgaged Property (as applicable) to be vested in Borrower, free and clear of
all Liens and other matters affecting title other than the Permitted Encumbrances; 

(ii)           pay to
Lender the Good Faith Deposit; and 

(iii)           make
a Rate Lock Request. 

Schedule 3  

(B)           If the Conversion
closes, Lender shall refund the Good Faith Deposit to Borrower within thirty (30) days after the Conversion Closing Date. If Borrower
pays the Good Faith Deposit but does not timely exercise the Conversion Option and the Fixed Rate is not rate locked, Lender shall
refund the Good Faith Deposit to Borrower within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a written request from Borrower (and the
interest rate shall remain at the Adjustable Rate). If Borrower timely exercises the Conversion Option, but the Conversion is not
consummated for any reason other than a default by Lender in performing its obligations under the Loan Agreement, Borrower shall
forfeit the Good Faith Deposit and (i) if the MBS Investor is not Fannie Mae, shall be fully liable for, and agrees to pay on demand,
any and all loss, costs and/or damages incurred by Lender in connection with Borrower s failure to consummate the Conversion
as provided herein, including any loss, costs and/or damages incurred by Lender in excess of the Good Faith Deposit, and (ii) if
the MBS Investor is Fannie Mae or if the converted Mortgage Loan is held by Fannie Mae and does not back an MBS, the Good Faith
Deposit shall serve as liquidated damages resulting from failure to consummate the Conversion. Borrower expressly acknowledges
that by electing to convert the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan to the Fixed Rate, and agreeing to the Fixed Rate as provided
herein, Borrower is causing Lender to take a position in the financial markets in reliance thereon, and the failure of Borrower
to convert the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan to the Fixed Rate as provided herein may cause Lender to incur economic damages. 

(C)           If Borrower
desires to exercise the Conversion Option and has complied with all other requirements of Section 7(d) of this Schedule, within
fifteen (15) days of Borrower s receipt of the NOI Determination Notice, Borrower shall contact Lender to initiate a Rate
Lock Request. If the Fixed Rate quoted to Borrower is greater than the Maximum Fixed Rate, Borrower shall not be permitted to accept
the quoted Fixed Rate (or exercise its Conversion Option). On or before 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) of the day Borrower accepts the
quoted Fixed Rate, Borrower and Lender shall confirm to each other (by letter addressed from Lender to Borrower, acknowledged and
accepted in writing by Borrower and transmitted, in each case, by facsimile or other electronic transmission acceptable to Lender),
(i) the Fixed Rate, (ii) the New Maturity Date (if applicable), (iii) the Conversion Effective Date, (iv) the new Monthly Debt
Service Payment and (v) the Initial Fixed Rate Payment Date. 

(c)           Amendment to Multifamily
Loan and Security Agreement.  

The Conversion
shall be evidenced by the Conversion Amendment. 

(d)           Conditions Precedent to
Closing of Conversion.  

Borrower s
right to consummate the Conversion and Lender s obligation to execute and deliver the Conversion Amendment, shall be subject
to satisfaction of the conditions precedent below. 

(1)           All representations
and warranties of Borrower set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the
Conversion Closing Date as though made on and as of the Conversion Closing Date. 

Schedule 3  

(2)           Borrower
shall have performed or complied with all of its obligations under the Loan Agreement to be performed or complied with on or before
the Conversion Closing Date. 

(3)           On the
Conversion Closing Date, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or any event which, with the giving of notice
or the passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). 

(4)           On the
Conversion Closing Date, Lender shall have received all of the following, each of which, where applicable, shall be executed by
individuals authorized to do so, shall be dated as of the Closing Date, and shall be in form and substance acceptable to Lender: 

(A)           the Conversion
Amendment; 

(B)           an endorsement
to the Title Policy or a new Title Policy as of the Conversion Closing Date showing that the Security Instrument constitutes a
valid mortgage lien on the Mortgaged Property, with the same lien priority insured by the Title Policy, subject only to the Permitted
Encumbrances; 

(C)           either (i)
the Survey, redated to a date within fifteen (15) days prior to the Conversion Closing Date showing that there are no Liens or
other matters that have arisen since the date of the Survey other than matters approved in writing by Lender, or (ii) affirmative
coverage in the title insurance endorsement referred to in Section 7(d)(4)(B) that there are no exceptions based upon the results
of a visual inspection of the Mortgaged Property, or the absence of any exception based upon any facts or conditions which have
arisen since the date of the Survey and which would be disclosed by a current survey of the Mortgaged Property; 

(D)           if necessary,
as determined by Lender, an amendment to the Security Instrument to be recorded in the land records and insured as a supplement
to the Security Instrument to reflect the New Maturity Date; 

(E)           an opinion
of counsel satisfactory to Lender as to such matters as Lender may reasonably request; and 

(F)           such other
documents as Lender may reasonably request related to the Loan Agreement, the Conversion Amendment or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. 

Schedule 3  

(5)           The Mortgaged
Property shall not have been damaged, destroyed or subject to any condemnation or other taking, in whole or any material part,
and Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower, dated as of the Conversion Closing Date, to such effect. 

8.  Property Condition Assessment. 

Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 13.02(a)(3)(A), if the Conversion Option is exercised for any Mortgaged Property other than an  affordable housing
property  (as indicated on the Summary of Loan Terms), and extends the Loan Term, then a new property condition assessment
shall be required in the earlier of (a) the Loan Year that would have been the final Loan Year of the Mortgage Loan had the Conversion
Option not been exercised, or (b) the tenth (10th) Loan Year.

Schedule 7  

In the Winter of 2013-2014, following
issuance of the certificate of occupancy in September 2013 and prior to Borrower s ownership in December 2014, the building
experienced a rupture of sprinkler pipes.  The pitch on the sprinkler pipes was not sufficient; therefore water did not drain
adequately from the system. The pipes froze in the winter temperatures. When temperatures rose above freezing, they burst in the
following locations  Main assisted living dining room, above the assisted living nurse s station, as well as entrance
into the memory care unit. Following this, about a week later, the same event occurred in the back hallway area including the small
dining room,  Kids Zone , and storage room. As a resolution the pipes were re-pitched by the builder. 

All Personal Property that is material to and is used in
connection with the management, ownership and operation of the Mortgaged Property is owned by Gables of Hudson TRS, LLC.

Article
2 - GENERAL MORTGAGE LOAN TERMS 

Section 2.01        Mortgage
Loan Origination and Security. 

(a)          Making
of Mortgage Loan. 

Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Lender hereby makes the Mortgage Loan to Borrower, and Borrower
hereby accepts the Mortgage Loan from Lender. Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall: 

(1)         pay
the Indebtedness, including the Prepayment Premium, if any (whether in connection with any voluntary prepayment or in connection
with an acceleration by Lender of the Indebtedness), in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
and 

(2)         perform,
observe, and comply with this Loan Agreement and all other provisions of the other Loan Documents. 

(b)          Security
for Mortgage Loan. 

The Mortgage Loan is made
pursuant to this Loan Agreement, is evidenced by the Note, and is secured by the Security Instrument, this Loan Agreement, and
the other Loan Documents that are expressly stated to be security for the Mortgage Loan. 

(c)          Protective
Advances. 

As provided in the Security
Instrument, Lender may take such actions or disburse such funds as Lender reasonably deems necessary to perform the obligations
of Borrower under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to protect Lender s interest in the Mortgaged Property. 

Section 2.02         Payments
on Mortgage Loan. 

(a)          Debt
Service Payments. 

(1)         Short
Month Interest.  

If the date the
Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed is any day other than the first day of the month, interest for the period beginning on the
disbursement date and ending on and including the last day of the month in which the disbursement occurs shall be payable by Borrower
on the date the Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed. In the event that the disbursement date is not the same as the Effective
Date, then: 

(A)         the
disbursement date and the Effective Date must be in the same month, and 

(B)         the
Effective Date shall not be the first day of the month. 

(2)         Interest
Accrual and Computation.  

Except as provided
in Section 2.02(a)(1), interest shall be paid in arrears. Interest shall accrue as provided in the Schedule of Interest Rate Type
Provisions and shall be computed in accordance with the Interest Accrual Method. If the Interest Accrual Method is  Actual/360, 
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the amount allocated to interest for each month will vary depending on the actual number
of calendar days during such month. 

(3)         Monthly
Debt Service Payments.  

Consecutive monthly
debt service installments (comprised of either interest only or principal and interest, depending on the Amortization Type), each
in the amount of the applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment, shall be due and payable on the First Payment Date, and on each Payment
Date thereafter until the Maturity Date, at which time all Indebtedness shall be due. Any regularly scheduled Monthly Debt Service
Payment that is received by Lender before the applicable Payment Date shall be deemed to have been received on such Payment Date
solely for the purpose of calculating interest due. All payments made by Borrower under this Loan Agreement shall be made without
set-off, counterclaim, or other defense. 

(4)         Payment
at Maturity.  

The unpaid principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan, any Accrued Interest thereon and all other Indebtedness shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date. 

(5)         Interest
Rate Type.  

See the Schedule
of Interest Rate Type Provisions for additional provisions, if any, specific to the Interest Rate Type. 

(b)          Capitalization
of Accrued But Unpaid Interest. 

Any accrued and unpaid
interest on the Mortgage Loan remaining past due for thirty (30) days or more may, at Lender s election, be added to and
become part of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan. 

(c)          Late
Charges. 

(1)         If
any Monthly Debt Service Payment due hereunder is not received by Lender within ten (10) days (or fifteen (15) days for any Mortgaged
Property located in Mississippi or North Carolina to comply with applicable law) after the applicable Payment Date, or any amount
payable under this Loan Agreement (other than the payment due on the Maturity Date for repayment of the Mortgage Loan in full)
or any other Loan Document is not received by Lender within ten (10) days (or fifteen (15) days for any Mortgaged Property located
in Mississippi or North Carolina to comply with applicable law) after the date such amount is due, inclusive of the date on which
such amount is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender, immediately without demand by Lender, the Late Charge. 

The Late Charge is payable in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any interest payable at the Default Rate pursuant to Section 2.02(d). 

(2)         Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)         its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Mortgage Loan; 

(B)         it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine those additional expenses; 

(C)         Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional expenses; and 

(D)         the
Late Charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into account all circumstances existing on the date hereof, of the
additional expenses Lender will incur by reason of any such late payment. 

(d)          Default
Rate. 

(1)         Default
interest shall be paid as follows: 

(A)         If
any amount due in respect of the Mortgage Loan (other than amounts due on the Maturity Date) remains past due for thirty (30) days
or more, interest on such unpaid amount(s) shall accrue from the date payment is due at the Default Rate and shall be payable upon
demand by Lender. 

(B)         If
any Indebtedness due is not paid in full on the Maturity Date, then interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on all such unpaid
amounts from the Maturity Date until fully paid and shall be payable upon demand by Lender. 

Absent a demand by Lender, any such
amounts shall be payable by Borrower in the same manner as provided for the payment of Monthly Debt Service Payments. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, interest shall also accrue at the Default Rate on any judgment obtained by Lender against Borrower
in connection with the Mortgage Loan. To the extent Borrower or any other Person is vested with a right of redemption, interest
shall continue to accrue at the Default Rate during any redemption period until such time as the Mortgaged Property has been redeemed. 

(2)         Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)         its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Mortgage Loan; and 

(B)         in
connection with any failure to timely pay all amounts due in respect of the Mortgage Loan on the Maturity Date, or during the time
that any amount due in respect of the Mortgage Loan is delinquent for more than thirty (30) days: 

(i)          Lender s
risk of nonpayment of the Mortgage Loan will be materially increased; 

(ii)         Lender s
ability to meet its other obligations and to take advantage of other investment opportunities will be adversely impacted; 

(iii)        Lender
will incur additional costs and expenses arising from its loss of the use of the amounts due; 

(iv)        it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine such additional costs and expenses; 

(v)         Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional risks, costs, and expenses; and 

(vi)        the
increase from the Interest Rate to the Default Rate represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the additional risks, costs, and
expenses Lender will incur by reason of Borrower s delinquent payment and the additional compensation Lender is entitled
to receive for the increased risks of nonpayment associated with a delinquency on the Mortgage Loan (taking into account all circumstances
existing on the Effective Date). 

(e)          Address
for Payments. 

All payments due pursuant
to the Loan Documents shall be payable at Lender s Payment Address, or such other place and in such manner as may be designated
from time to time by written notice to Borrower by Lender. 

(f)          Application
of Payments. 

If at any time Lender receives,
from Borrower or otherwise, any payment in respect of the Indebtedness that is less than all amounts due and payable at such time,
then Lender may apply such payment to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by Lender or hold
in suspense and not apply such payment at Lender s election. Neither Lender s acceptance of a payment that is less
than all amounts then due and payable, nor Lender s application of, or suspension of the application of, such payment, shall
constitute or be deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding the
application of any such payment to the Indebtedness, Borrower s obligations under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall remain unchanged. 

Section 2.03         Lockout/Prepayment. 

(a)          Prepayment;
Prepayment Lockout; Prepayment Premium. 

(1)         Borrower
shall not make a voluntary full or partial prepayment on the Mortgage Loan during any Prepayment Lockout Period nor shall Borrower
make a voluntary partial prepayment at any time. Except as expressly provided in this Loan Agreement (including as provided in
the Prepayment Premium Schedule), a Prepayment Premium calculated in accordance with the Prepayment Premium Schedule shall be payable
in connection with any prepayment of the Mortgage Loan. 

(2)         If
a Prepayment Lockout Period applies to the Mortgage Loan, and during such Prepayment Lockout Period Lender accelerates the unpaid
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan or otherwise applies collateral held by Lender to the repayment of any portion of the unpaid
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, the Prepayment Premium shall be due and payable and equal to the amount obtained by multiplying
the percentage indicated (if at all) in the Prepayment Premium Schedule by the amount of principal being prepaid at the time of
such acceleration or application. 

(b)          Voluntary
Prepayment in Full. 

At any time after the expiration
of any Prepayment Lockout Period, Borrower may voluntarily prepay the Mortgage Loan in full on a Permitted Prepayment Date so long
as: 

(1)         Borrower
delivers to Lender a Prepayment Notice specifying the Intended Prepayment Date not more than sixty (60) days, but not less than
thirty (30) days (if given via U.S. Postal Service) or twenty (20) days (if given via facsimile, e-mail, or overnight courier)
prior to such Intended Prepayment Date; and 

(2)         Borrower
pays to Lender an amount equal to the sum of: 

(A)         the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; plus 

(B)         all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the prepayment occurs); plus 

(C)         the
Prepayment Premium; plus 

(D)         all
other Indebtedness. 

In connection with any such voluntary prepayment,
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that interest shall always be calculated and paid through the last day of the month in which the
prepayment occurs (even if the Permitted Prepayment Date for such month is not the last day of such month, or if Lender approves
prepayment on an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date). Borrower further acknowledges that Lender is
not required to accept a voluntary prepayment of the Mortgage Loan on any day other than a Permitted Prepayment Date. However,
if Lender does approve an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date and accepts a prepayment on such Intended
Prepayment Date, such prepayment shall be deemed to be received on the immediately following Permitted Prepayment Date. If Borrower
fails to prepay the Mortgage Loan on the Intended Prepayment Date for any reason (including on any Intended Prepayment Date that
is approved by Lender) and such failure either continues for five (5) Business Days, or into the following month, Lender shall
have the right to recalculate the payoff amount. If Borrower prepays the Mortgage Loan either in the following month or more than
five (5) Business Days after the Intended Prepayment Date that was approved by Lender, Lender shall also have the right to recalculate
the payoff amount based upon the amount of such payment and the date such payment was received by Lender. Borrower shall immediately
pay to Lender any additional amounts required by any such recalculation. 

(c)          Acceleration
of Mortgage Loan. 

Upon acceleration of the
Mortgage Loan, Borrower shall pay to Lender: 

(1)         the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; 

(2)         all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the acceleration occurs); 

(3)         the
Prepayment Premium; and 

(4)         all
other Indebtedness. 

(d)          Application
of Collateral. 

Any application by Lender
of any collateral or other security to the repayment of all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan
prior to the Maturity Date in accordance with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a prepayment by Borrower. Any such prepayment
shall require the payment to Lender by Borrower of the Prepayment Premium calculated on the amount being prepaid in accordance
with this Loan Agreement. 

(e)          Casualty
and Condemnation. 

Notwithstanding any provision
of this Loan Agreement to the contrary, no Prepayment Premium shall be payable with respect to any prepayment occurring as a result
of the application of any insurance proceeds or amounts received in connection with a Condemnation Action in accordance with this
Loan Agreement. 

(f)          No
Effect on Payment Obligations. 

Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Loan Agreement, any prepayment required by any Loan Document of less than the entire unpaid principal balance
of the Mortgage Loan shall not extend or postpone the due date of any subsequent Monthly Debt Service Payments, Monthly Replacement
Reserve Deposit, or other payment, or change the amount of any such payments or deposits. 

(g)          Loss
Resulting from Prepayment. 

In any circumstance in
which a Prepayment Premium is due under this Loan Agreement, Borrower acknowledges that: 

(1)         any
prepayment of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, whether voluntary or involuntary, or following the occurrence
of an Event of Default by Borrower, will result in Lender s incurring loss, including reinvestment loss, additional risk,
expense, and frustration or impairment of Lender s ability to meet its commitments to third parties; 

(2)         it
is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such losses, risks, and damages; 

(3)         the
formula for calculating the Prepayment Premium represents a reasonable estimate of the losses, risks, and damages Lender will incur
as a result of a prepayment; and 

(4)         the
provisions regarding the Prepayment Premium contained in this Loan Agreement are a material part of the consideration for the Mortgage
Loan, and that the terms of the Mortgage Loan are in other respects more favorable to Borrower as a result of Borrower s
voluntary agreement to such prepayment provisions. 

Article
3 - PERSONAL LIABILITY 

Section 3.01         Non-Recourse
Mortgage Loan; Exceptions. 

Except as otherwise provided
in this Article 3 or in any other Loan Document, none of Borrower, or any director, officer, manager, member, partner, shareholder,
trustee, trust beneficiary, or employee of Borrower, shall have personal liability under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan
Document for the repayment of the Indebtedness or for the performance of any other obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents,
and Lender s only recourse for the satisfaction of such Indebtedness and the performance of such obligations shall be Lender s
exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Mortgaged Property and any other collateral held by Lender as security
for the Indebtedness. This limitation on Borrower s liability shall not limit or impair Lender s enforcement of its
rights against Guarantor under any Loan Document. 

Section 3.02         Personal
Liability of Borrower (Exceptions to Non-Recourse Provision). 

(a)          Personal
Liability Based on Lender s Loss. 

Borrower shall be personally
liable to Lender for the repayment of the portion of the Indebtedness equal to any loss or damage suffered by Lender as a result

(1)         failure
to pay as directed by Lender upon demand after an Event of Default (to the extent actually received by Borrower or Affiliated Property

Rents to which Lender is entitled under the Loan Documents; and 

(B)         the
amount of all security deposits then held or thereafter collected from tenants and not properly applied pursuant to the applicable
Leases; 

(2)         failure
to maintain all insurance policies required by the Loan Documents, except to the extent Lender has the obligation to pay the premiums
pursuant to Section 12.03(c); 

(3)         failure
to apply all insurance proceeds received by Borrower or Affiliated Property Operator or any amounts received by Borrower or Affiliated
Property Operator in connection with a Condemnation Action, as required by the Loan Documents; 

(4)         failure
to comply with any provision of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document relating to the delivery of books and records, statements,
schedules, and reports; 

(5)         except
to the extent directed otherwise by Lender pursuant to Section 3.02(a)(1), failure to apply Rents to the ordinary and necessary
expenses of owning or operating, as applicable, the Mortgaged Property and Debt Service Amounts, as and when each is due and payable,
except that Borrower will not be personally liable with respect to Rents that are distributed by Borrower in any calendar year
if Borrower has paid all ordinary and necessary expenses of owning or operating, as applicable, the Mortgaged Property and Debt
Service Amounts for such calendar year; 

(6)         waste
or abandonment of the Mortgaged Property; 

(7)         grossly
negligent or reckless unintentional material misrepresentation or omission by Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor,
Key Principal, or any officer, director, partner, manager, member, shareholder, or trustee of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator,
Guarantor, or Key Principal in connection with on-going financial or other reporting required by the Loan Documents, or any request
for action or consent by Lender; 

(8)         failure
to cause the renewal, continuation, extension, or maintenance of all Licenses or, if any Licenses are to be transferred to a transferee
approved by Lender, failure to cause such Licenses to be transferred or reissued within the period of time required under applicable
law and to provide to Lender written notice of such transfer including copies of the newly issued Licenses; or 

(9)         revocation
or termination without Lender s consent of the standing instructions from Borrower or Property Operator to the depositary
bank pursuant to any Depositary Agreement. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall
not have personal liability under clauses (1), (3), or (5) above to the extent that Borrower lacks the legal right to direct the
disbursement of the applicable funds due to an involuntary Bankruptcy Event that occurs without the consent, encouragement, or
active participation of (A) Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal, (B) any Person Controlling Borrower,
Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal or (C) any Person Controlled by or under common Control with Borrower,

Authorization. 

(1)         The
execution, delivery, and performance by Borrower of this Loan Agreement, the Facility Operating Agreement, and the other Loan Documents
have been duly authorized by all necessary action and proceedings by or on behalf of Borrower, and no further approvals or filings

Force Majeure exists and Borrower is diligently pursuing the reinstitution of such work, provided, however, any such abandonment
or cessation shall not in any event allow the Repair to be completed after the Completion Period, subject to Force Majeure); and

and Leases; 

(2)         procure
and maintain all required permits, licenses, charters, registrations, and certificates necessary to comply with all zoning and

(5)         promptly
after Borrower s or Property Operator s receipt or notification thereof, provide Lender copies of any building code
or zoning violation from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mortgaged Property. 

(f)          Licensing. 

(1)         Borrower

provide Lender written notice within five (5) days of Borrower s or Property Operator s receipt of any notice or order
of a violation which may otherwise have an adverse impact on Borrower, Property Operator, or the Mortgaged Property, its operations,
or its compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the Borrower s
conversion of the commercial space used to provide adult day care services into eight (8) Alzheimer units, Borrower shall be permitted
to relinquish or allow to be relinquished, the adult day care license. 

(2)         If
any License requirement is imposed upon the Mortgaged Property after the Effective Date, Borrower shall obtain, or shall cause
the Property Operator, if applicable, to obtain, all Licenses and shall maintain, or shall cause the Property Operator, if applicable,

(3)         Without
the prior written consent of Lender, Borrower shall not, and shall require Property Operator, if applicable, not to amend, modify,
transfer, or otherwise change the Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the Borrower s conversion of
the commercial space used to provide adult day care services into eight (8) Alzheimer units, Borrower shall be permitted to relinquish
or allow to be relinquished, the adult day care license. 

(4)         Borrower
shall promptly inform Lender in writing and shall cause Property Operator to promptly inform Lender in writing, if such party has
actual knowledge of, and shall deliver to Lender copies of, (A) any written communications, complaints, orders, judgments, and
other documents relating to the commencement of any litigation, rulemaking, or disciplinary proceeding or the promulgation of any
proposed or final rule which would have, or may reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Mortgaged Property,

(i) Borrower or Property Operator is being placed under regulatory supervision, (ii) any License related to the conduct of Borrower s
or Property Operator s, if applicable, business or the Mortgaged Property is to be suspended or revoked, or (iii) Borrower
or Property Operator is to cease and desist any practice, procedure, or policy employed by Borrower or Property Operator in the
conduct of its business, and such cessation would have, or may reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the
Mortgaged Property, or the Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the Borrower s conversion of the commercial
space used to provide adult day care services into eight (8) Alzheimer units, Borrower shall be permitted to relinquish or allow
to be relinquished, the adult day care license without further notice to Lender. 

(g)          Medicaid
Provider Agreement. 

(1)         If
neither Borrower nor any Property Operator is a Medicaid Participant as of the Effective Date, Borrower shall notify Lender in
writing thirty (30) days prior to Borrower s or any Property Operator s (with respect to the Mortgaged Property) submission
of its request to enter into a Medicaid Provider Agreement, and will provide Lender with copies of all correspondence and documentation
received from the Governmental Authority or the Managed Care Organization concerning its submission. In the event Borrower or any
Property Operator becomes a Medicaid Participant with respect to the Mortgaged Property, Borrower and such Property Operator shall
execute the form of Medicaid reserve agreement and Depositary Agreement as Lender may require. 

(2)         The
following provisions apply if a Medicaid Provider Agreement is in place as of the Effective Date or entered into at any time during
the Term of the Mortgage Loan: 

(A)         Borrower
and Property Operator shall comply with the terms and conditions of the Medicaid Provider Agreement and shall enforce the obligations
of each Managed Care Organization or Governmental Authority under the applicable Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(B)         Borrower
and Property Operator shall maintain their respective compliance with the provider standards, including all conditions for participation,
as required by the Managed Care Organization or the Governmental Authority, as applicable;

or Property Operator, as applicable, shall not permit or allow more than twenty percent (20%) of the Mortgaged Property s
effective gross income to be derived from funds paid to Borrower or Property Operator by a Governmental Authority or a Managed
Care Organization, as applicable, under a Medicaid Provider Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower or any Property
Operator is a Medicaid Participant with respect to the Mortgaged Property, and if by reason of applicable law or regulation more
than twenty percent (20%) of effective gross income is derived from funds paid to such Borrower or Property Operator by a Governmental
Authority or a Managed Care Organization, Borrower and Property Operator shall take in a diligent and expeditious manner all reasonable
steps necessary to comply with the preceding sentence to the extent permissible by applicable law or regulation; 

(D)         without
the prior written consent of Lender, Borrower and Property Operator shall not:

or otherwise modify the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(ii)         terminate
the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(iii)        waive
a default under the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement; or 

(iv)        enter
into a new Medicaid Provider Agreement or renew or replace an existing Medicaid Provider Agreement; and 

(E)         within
five (5) days after Borrower s or any Property Operator s receipt thereof, Borrower shall give Lender written notice
of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates that: 

(i)          either
Borrower or any Property Operator is in default under the terms of the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(ii)         the
applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization intends to amend, modify, or terminate the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(iii)        Borrower
or Property Operator has ceased to meet the provider standards required by the applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care
Organization; 

(iv)        Borrower
or Property Operator has received notice from any Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization that the rates for services
provided under the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement will be adjusted; or 

(v)         either
Borrower or any Property Operator has been excluded from participation in any Governmental Health Care Program with respect to
the Mortgaged Property or any other property. 

(h)          Facility
Operating Agreement. 

(1)         The
provisions of this Section 6.02(h)(1) apply to all Facility Operating Agreements other than a Seniors Housing Facility Lease and
to all Property Operators other than a Property Operator under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower shall comply with and
shall enforce the obligations of each Property Operator under each Facility Operating Agreement. Without the prior written consent
of Lender, Borrower shall not: 

(A)         modify,
amend, supplement, or restate any Facility Operating Agreement; 

(B)         waive
a default under any Facility Operating Agreement; 

(C)         waive
any of Borrower s rights or fail to diligently pursue Borrower s remedies under the Facility Operating Agreement; 

(D)         add
or release a property to or from any Facility Operating Agreement; or 

(E)         violate
the provisions of Section 11.02(c). 

(2)         Within
five (5) days of Borrower s receipt or delivery (or any Property Operator s receipt), Borrower shall provide Lender
written notice of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates either Borrower or any
Property Operator is (A) in default under the terms of any Facility Operating Agreement, (B) amending, modifying, or terminating
any Facility Operating Agreement, or (C) otherwise discontinuing its operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(3)         After
Borrower receives notice (or otherwise has actual knowledge) of an Event of Default under the Loan Documents, it will not make
any payment of fees under or pursuant to the Facility Operating Agreement without Lender s prior written consent. 

(4)         Borrower
shall cause each Property Operator, where applicable, to comply with the terms, conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative
and negative covenants of this Loan Agreement relating to the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property, including all terms,
conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants set forth in this Loan Agreement applicable to the
organization, existence, and good standing of Property Operator necessary for the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property. 

(i)          Change
in Property Operator. 

Each Property Operator
and each Facility Operating Agreement must be approved in writing in advance by Lender. Borrower shall not remove or permit or
suffer the removal of any Property Operator without the prior written consent of Lender and unless and until Lender has approved
in writing a replacement Property Operator. Each Facility Operating Agreement or other similar agreement between Borrower and a
new Property Operator must be approved in writing in advance by Lender, and Borrower and the new Property Operator must execute
and deliver to Lender a SASA in form required by Lender, subject to the provisions of Section 6.03(a). Borrower shall notify Lender
in writing of any name change of an Affiliated Property Operator or any change in an Affiliated Property Operator s place
of incorporation or organization. Borrower agrees that Lender shall have the right to remove any Property Operator at any time
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, subject to the provisions of the SASA. 

(j)          Contracts. 

Borrower may in the future
enter into Contracts for the provision of additional goods or services at or otherwise in connection with the operation, use, or
management of the Mortgaged Property. Borrower absolutely and unconditionally pledges, grants a security interest in, and assigns
to Lender all of Borrower s right, title, and interest in, to, and under the Contracts, including Borrower s right,
power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Until Lender gives notice to Borrower of Lender s
exercise of its rights under this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall have all right, power, and authority granted to Borrower under
any Contract (except as otherwise limited by this subsection or any other provision of this Loan Agreement), including the right,
power, and authority to modify the terms of any Contract or extend or terminate any Contract. If an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, and at the option of Lender, the permission given to Borrower pursuant to the preceding sentence to exercise
all right, power, and authority under Contracts shall terminate. Upon Lender s delivery of notice to Borrower of an Event
of Default, Lender shall immediately have all right, power, and authority granted to Borrower under any Contract, including the
right, power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Borrower shall fully perform all of
its obligations under the Contracts, and Borrower agrees not to assign, sell, pledge, transfer, mortgage, or otherwise encumber
its interests in any of the Contracts without the prior written approval of Lender. Each Contract entered into by Borrower subsequent
to the date hereof, the average annual consideration of which, directly or indirectly, is at least $50,000, shall provide: (A)
that it shall be terminable for cause, and (B) that it shall be terminable, at Lender s option, upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default. 

(k)          All
Representations and Covenants Deemed Borrower Responsibility. 

(1)         Any
act, action, term, condition, provision, requirement, or covenant required to be performed, or prohibited from being performed,
by Borrower under the Loan Documents including with respect to 

(A)         the
use, management or operation of the Mortgaged Property, including any licensing, repair, reporting, or insurance requirements,
and 

(B)         the
organization, existence, good standing or other entity-level requirements, shall be interpreted as requiring Borrower either to
perform such act or action directly or to cause Property Operator, a property manager or other appropriate agent to perform such
act or action. Any right or privilege assigned or delegated by Borrower or Property Operator to any other Person shall be construed
as being accompanied by each relevant obligation or restriction set forth in the Loan Documents or any Facility Operating Agreement,
as applicable. 

(C)         In
each instance that Borrower makes, or in the future renews or is deemed to renew, a representation, warranty, or covenant in this
Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents regarding the condition, knowledge, acts, or omissions of Property Operator or any Property
Operator Business Information, or the condition of the Mortgaged Property, Borrower does and shall do so with full knowledge, after
due inquiry (including the due inquiry of and by Guarantor), of such information. Any reporting or compliance delay caused by Property
Operator or Guarantor shall not excuse Borrower s timely performance of the terms of this Loan Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower s reliance upon incorrect or incomplete information received from
Property Operator or Guarantor and the reporting of the same to Lender, whether or not Borrower had actual knowledge that such
information was incorrect or incomplete and whether or not Borrower is otherwise in violation of the terms of this Loan Agreement,
shall not be (and none of Borrower, Property Operator, Guarantor, nor Key Principal shall assert) a defense to Lender s determination
that an Event of Default has occurred or that Borrower (or Guarantor) has incurred personal liability as set forth in Article 3
of this Loan Agreement. 

Section 6.03        Mortgage
Loan Administration Matters Regarding the Property. 

(a)          Property
Management. 

If, in connection with
the making of the Mortgage Loan, or at any later date, Lender waives in writing the requirement for a written contract for the
operation or management of the Mortgaged Property, and Borrower later elects to enter into a written contract or change the operation
or management of the Mortgaged Property, such new Property Operator and any Facility Operating Agreement must be approved by Lender.
As a condition to any approval by Lender, Borrower and such new Property Operator shall enter into a SASA. 

(b)          Subordination
of Fees by Property Operator. 

All fees due to an Affiliated
Property Operator in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right to the
prior payment in full of the Indebtedness. All fees due to a non-Affiliated Property Operator in connection with the operation
and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of monthly debt
service and funding of escrows and reserves as required under the Mortgage Loan Documents, and the payment of all operating expenses
and capital expenditures incurred in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(c)          Property
Condition Assessment. 

If, in connection with
any inspection of the Mortgaged Property, Lender determines that the condition of the Mortgaged Property has deteriorated (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) since the Effective Date, Lender may obtain, at Borrower s expense, a property condition assessment
of the Mortgaged Property. Lender s right to obtain a property condition assessment pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) shall
be in addition to any other rights available to Lender under this Loan Agreement in connection with any such deterioration. Any
such inspection or property condition assessment may result in Lender requiring Additional Lender Repairs or Additional Lender
Replacements as further described in Section 13.02(a)(9)(B). 

Article
7 - LEASES AND RENTS 

Section 7.01        Representations
and Warranties. 

The representations and
warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 7.01 are made as of the Effective Date and are true and correct except as
disclosed on the Exceptions to Representations and Warranties Schedule. 

(a)          Prior
Assignment of Rents. 

Borrower has not executed
any: 

(1)         prior
assignment of Rents (other than an assignment of Rents securing prior indebtedness that has been paid off and discharged or will
be paid off and discharged with the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan); or 

(2)         instrument
which would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument, or the SASA. 

(b)          Prepaid
Rents. 

Borrower has not accepted,
and does not expect to receive prepayment of, any Rents for one (1) month for the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or more than two
(2) months under any other Lease prior to the due dates of such Rents. 

(c)          Seniors
Housing Facility Lease. 

(1)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease is in full force and effect and there is neither a default thereunder nor any condition that, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder. No right or claim of rescission, offset,
abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim has been asserted with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease, and there
is no existing condition that, with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would result in a right or claim of rescission,
offset, abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim under the terms and provisions of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower
has performed and discharged all of the obligations on the part of Borrower to be performed and discharged pursuant to the terms
set forth in the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. 

(2)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has not been modified, amended or supplemented by either party thereto. The Property Operator has
not been released, in whole or in part, from any of its obligations under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. There has been no
prior sale, transfer, assignment, hypothecation, or pledge of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease (other than in connection with
the Loan Documents) that is outstanding. 

(3)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has an original term ending on or after the date ninety (90) days after the Maturity Date. Absent
Lender s direction, the Property Operator cannot terminate the Seniors Housing Facility Lease for any reason prior to the
payment in full of the Indebtedness. 

(4)         There
is no free rent, partial rent or rebate of rent required to be given by Borrower to Property Operator under the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease. The Seniors Housing Facility Lease does not permit Property Operator to accept, and Property Operator has not accepted,
prepayment of Rents more than two (2) months in advance (and Borrower has not accepted prepayment of Rents more than one (1) month
in advance with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease). Each payment due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease is sufficient
to pay the Debt Service Amounts (including Monthly Debt Service Payments, Taxes, Impositions, and any Replacement Reserve Deposits)
in full on or prior to the due date thereof (without giving effect to any applicable grace periods) currently and throughout the
term of the Mortgage Loan. Payments due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease are payable without notice or demand, and without
setoff, recoupment, abatement, or reduction. 

(5)         Property
Operator has no right or option pursuant to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any part of the
Mortgaged Property, the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises are a part. 

(6)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease contains customary and enforceable provisions that render the rights and remedies of Borrower adequate
for the enforcement and satisfaction of the Borrower s rights thereunder. 

(7)         Borrower
represents and warrants that it is the express intent of Borrower and Property Operator that the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
constitute a lease under applicable real property laws and laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency, and creditors  rights generally,
and that the sole interest of Property Operator in the Mortgaged Property is as a tenant under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease.
The Seniors Housing Facility Lease is not intended to be deemed a guaranty.

(a)          Leases. 

Borrower shall:

(3)         require

respect to any non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall not:

(B)         modify
the terms of any non-Material Commercial Lease (including any non-Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective Date)
in any way that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to such non-Material Commercial Lease in
effect as of the Effective Date, reduces the number or size of residential units at the Mortgaged Property, or results in such
non-Material Commercial Lease being deemed a Material Commercial Lease. 

(3)         With
respect to any Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall cause the applicable tenant to provide
within ten (10) days after a request by Borrower, a certificate of estoppel, or if not provided by tenant within such ten (10)
day period, Borrower shall provide such certificate of estoppel, certifying: 

(A)         that
such Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been
modifications, that such Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease is in full force and effect as modified and
stating the modifications); 

(B)         the
term of the Lease including any extensions thereto; 

(C)         the
dates to which the Rent and any other charges hereunder have been paid by tenant; 

(D)         the

of default) under such Lease; 

(F)         the
address to which notices to tenant should be sent; and 

(G)         any
other information as may be reasonably required by Lender.

TO PURCHASE THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE AT BORROWER S COST. SUCH INSURANCE MAY, BUT NEED NOT, PROTECT BORROWER S INTERESTS.
THE COVERAGE THAT LENDER PURCHASES MAY NOT PAY ANY CLAIM THAT BORROWER MAKES OR ANY CLAIM THAT IS MADE AGAINST BORROWER IN CONNECTION
WITH THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY. IF LENDER PURCHASES INSURANCE FOR THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY AS PERMITTED HEREUNDER, BORROWER WILL BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS OF THAT INSURANCE, INCLUDING INTEREST AT THE DEFAULT RATE AND ANY OTHER CHARGES LENDER MAY IMPOSE IN
CONNECTION WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE INSURANCE UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CANCELLATION OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE INSURANCE.
THE COSTS OF THE INSURANCE SHALL BE ADDED TO BORROWER S TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OR OBLIGATION AND SHALL CONSTITUTE ADDITIONAL
INDEBTEDNESS. THE COSTS OF THE INSURANCE MAY BE MORE THAN THE COST OF INSURANCE BORROWER MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ITS OWN. BORROWER
MAY LATER CANCEL ANY INSURANCE PURCHASED BY LENDER, BUT ONLY AFTER PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT BORROWER HAS OBTAINED INSURANCE AS REQUIRED
BY THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. 

(b)          Application
of Proceeds on Event of Loss. 

(1)         Upon
an event of loss, Lender may, at Lender s option: 

(A)         hold
such proceeds to be applied to reimburse Borrower for the cost of Restoration (in accordance with Lender s then-current policies
relating to the restoration of casualty damage on similar multifamily residential properties); or 

(B)         apply
such proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness, whether or not then due;  provided ,  however , Lender shall not apply
insurance proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness and shall permit Restoration pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(1)(A) if all of
the following conditions are met: 

(i)          no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or any event which, with the giving of written notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); 

(ii)         Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(iii)        Lender
determines that the net operating income generated by the Mortgaged Property after completion of the Restoration will be sufficient
to support a debt service coverage ratio not less than the debt service coverage ratio immediately prior to the event of loss,
but in no event less than 1.0x (the debt service coverage ratio shall be calculated on a thirty (30) year amortizing basis (if
applicable, on a   proforma   basis approved by Lender) in all events and shall include payments due from any Operator
under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease and all operating costs and other expenses, Imposition Deposits, deposits to Collateral
Accounts, and Mortgage Loan repayment obligations); 

(iv)        Lender
determines that the Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (1) one year before the stated Maturity Date, or (2) one
year after the date of the loss or casualty; and 

(v)         Borrower
provides Lender, upon written request, evidence of the availability during and after the Restoration of the insurance required
to be maintained pursuant to this Loan Agreement. 

After the completion of Restoration
in accordance with the above requirements, as determined by Lender, the balance, if any, of such proceeds shall be returned to
Borrower. 

(2)         Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any loss is estimated to be in an amount equal to or less than $50,000, Lender shall not exercise its rights
and remedies as power-of-attorney herein and shall allow Borrower to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any claims under
policies of property damage insurance, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such policies of property damage insurance,
and to collect and receive the proceeds of property damage insurance; provided that each of the following conditions shall be satisfied: 

(A)         Borrower
shall immediately notify Lender of the casualty giving rise to the claim; 

(B)         no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or any event which, with the giving of written notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); 

(C)         the
Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (i) one year before the stated Maturity Date or (ii) one year after the date
of the loss or casualty; 

(D)         Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(E)         all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be issued in the form of joint checks to Borrower and Lender; 

(F)         all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be applied to the Restoration; 

(G)         Borrower
shall deliver to Lender evidence satisfactory to Lender of completion of the Restoration and obtainment of all lien releases; 

(H)         Borrower
shall have complied to Lender s satisfaction with the foregoing requirements on any prior claims subject to this provision,
if any; and 

(I)         Lender
shall have the right to inspect the Mortgaged Property (subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases, other than the Seniors
Housing Facility Lease). 

(3)         If
Lender elects to apply insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall
not be obligated to restore or repair the Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to the damaged portion of
the Mortgaged Property and, at its expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by insurance, clean up any debris resulting
from the casualty event, and, if required or otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining part of the damaged
Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable, and marketable condition.
Nothing in this Section 9.03(b) shall affect any of Lender s remedial rights against Borrower in connection with a breach
by Borrower of any of its obligations under this Loan Agreement or under any Loan Document, including any failure to timely pay
Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain the insurance coverage(s) required by this Loan Agreement. 

(c)          Payment
Obligations Unaffected. 

The application of any
insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness shall not extend or postpone the Maturity Date, or the due date or the full payment of any
Monthly Debt Service Payment, Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, or any other installments referred to in this Loan Agreement
or in any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lender applies insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in connection
with a casualty of less than the entire Mortgaged Property, and after such application of proceeds the debt service coverage ratio
(as determined by Lender) is less than 1.25x based on the then-applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment and the anticipated on-going
net operating income of the Mortgaged Property after such casualty event, then Lender may, at its discretion, permit an adjustment
to the Monthly Debt Service Payments that become due and owing thereafter, based on Lender s then-current underwriting requirements.
In no event shall the preceding sentence obligate Lender to make any adjustment to the Monthly Debt Service Payments. 

(d)          Foreclosure
Sale. 

If the Mortgaged Property
is transferred pursuant to a Foreclosure Event or Lender otherwise acquires title to the Mortgaged Property, Borrower acknowledges
that Lender shall automatically succeed to all rights of Borrower in and to any insurance policies and unearned insurance premiums
applicable to the Mortgaged Property and in and to the proceeds resulting from any damage to the Mortgaged Property prior to such
Foreclosure Event or such acquisition. 

(e)          Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby authorizes
and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c).

results in or from damage to the Mortgaged Property and Lender elects to apply the proceeds or awards from such Condemnation Action
to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement, Borrower shall not be obligated to restore or repair the
Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to any portion of the Mortgaged Property which has been damaged or destroyed
in connection with such Condemnation Action and, at Borrower s expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by

otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining part of the damaged Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to
keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable, and marketable condition. Nothing in this Section 10.03(d) shall
affect any of Lender s remedial rights against Borrower in connection with a breach by Borrower of any of its obligations

Section 12.01      Representations
and Warranties.

warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 12.01 are made as of the Effective Date and are true and correct except as
disclosed on the Exceptions to Representations and Warranties Schedule. 

(a)          Payment
of Taxes, Assessments, and Other Charges. 

Borrower has: 

(1)         paid
(or with the approval of Lender, established an escrow fund sufficient to pay when due and payable) all amounts and charges relating
to the Mortgaged Property that have become due and payable before any fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto,
including Impositions, leasehold payments, and ground rents; 

(2)         paid
all Taxes for the Mortgaged Property that have become due before any fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto
pursuant to any notice of assessment received by Borrower and any and all taxes that have become due against Borrower before any
fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto; 

(3)         no
knowledge of any basis for any additional assessments; 

(4)         no
knowledge of any presently pending special assessments against all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, or any presently pending
special assessments against Borrower; and 

(5)         not
received any written notice of any contemplated special assessment against the Mortgaged Property, or any contemplated special
assessment against Borrower. 

Section 12.02      Covenants. 

(a)          Imposition
Deposits, Taxes, and Other Charges. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)         deposit
the Imposition Deposits with Lender on each Payment Date (or on another day designated in writing by Lender) in amount sufficient,
in Lender s discretion, to enable Lender to pay each Imposition before the last date upon which such payment may be made
without any penalty or interest charge being added, plus an amount equal to no more than one-sixth (1/6) (or the amount permitted
by applicable law) of the Impositions for the trailing twelve (12) months (calculated based on the aggregate annual Imposition
costs divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by two (2)); 

(2)         deposit
with Lender, within ten (10) days after written notice from Lender (subject to applicable law), such additional amounts estimated
by Lender to be reasonably necessary to cure any deficiency in the amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment of a specific
Imposition; 

(3)         except
as set forth in Section 12.03(c) below, pay all Impositions, leasehold payments, ground rents, and Taxes when due and before any
fine, penalty, interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto; 

(4)         promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all notices of, and invoices for, Impositions, and, if Borrower pays any Imposition directly, Borrower
shall promptly furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payments; and 

(5)         promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all notices of any special assessments and contemplated special assessments against the Mortgaged Property
or Borrower. 

Section 12.03      Mortgage
Loan Administration Matters Regarding Impositions. 

(a)          Maintenance
of Records by Lender. 

Lender shall maintain records
of the monthly and aggregate Imposition Deposits held by Lender for the purpose of paying Taxes, insurance premiums, and each other
obligation of Borrower for which Imposition Deposits are required. 

(b)          Imposition
Accounts. 

All Imposition Deposits
shall be held in an institution (which may be Lender, if Lender is such an institution) whose deposits or accounts are insured
or guaranteed by a federal agency and which accounts meet the standards for custodial accounts as required by Lender from time
to time. Lender shall not be obligated to open additional accounts, or deposit Imposition Deposits in additional institutions,
when the amount of the Imposition Deposits exceeds the maximum amount of the federal deposit insurance or guaranty. No interest,
earnings, or profits on the Imposition Deposits shall be paid to Borrower unless applicable law so requires. Imposition Deposits
shall not be trust funds, nor shall they operate to reduce the Indebtedness, unless applied by Lender for that purpose in accordance
with this Loan Agreement. For the purposes of 9-104(a)(3) of the UCC, Lender is the owner of the Imposition Deposits and shall
be deemed a  customer  with sole control of the account holding the Imposition Deposits. 

(c)          Payment
of Impositions; Sufficiency of Imposition Deposits. 

Lender may pay an Imposition
according to any bill, statement, or estimate from the appropriate public office or insurance company without inquiring into the
accuracy of the bill, statement, or estimate or into the validity of the Imposition. Imposition Deposits shall be required to be
used by Lender to pay Taxes, insurance premiums and any other individual Imposition only if: 

(1)         no
Event of Default exists; 

(2)         Borrower
has timely delivered to Lender all applicable bills or premium notices that it has received; and 

(3)         sufficient
Imposition Deposits are held by Lender for each Imposition at the time such Imposition becomes due and payable. 

Lender shall have no liability
to Borrower or any other Person for failing to pay any Imposition if any of the conditions are not satisfied. If at any time the
amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment of a specific Imposition exceeds the amount reasonably deemed necessary by Lender
to be held in connection with such Imposition, the excess may be credited against future installments of Imposition Deposits for
such Imposition. 

(d)          Imposition
Deposits Upon Event of Default. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Lender may apply any Imposition Deposits, in such amount and in such order as Lender determines,
to pay any Impositions or as a credit against the Indebtedness. 

(e)          Contesting
Impositions. 

Other than insurance premiums,
Borrower may contest, at its expense, by appropriate legal proceedings, the amount or validity of any Imposition if: 

(1)         Borrower
notifies Lender of the commencement or expected commencement of such proceedings; 

(2)         Lender
determines that the Mortgaged Property is not in danger of being sold or forfeited; 

(3)         Borrower
deposits with Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority if required by applicable law) reserves sufficient to pay the contested
Imposition, if required by Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority); 

(4)         Borrower
furnishes whatever additional security is required in the proceedings or is reasonably requested in writing by Lender; and 

(5)         Borrower
commences, and at all times thereafter diligently prosecutes, such contest in good faith until a final determination is made by
the applicable Governmental Authority. 

(f)          Release
to Borrower. 

Upon payment in full of
all sums secured by the Security Instrument and this Loan Agreement and release by Lender of the lien of the Security Instrument,
Lender shall disburse to Borrower the balance of any Imposition Deposits then on deposit with Lender.

(2)         pay
all applicable fees and charges of any Governmental Authority on account of the Replacements and Repairs, as applicable; and

(d)          Assignment
of Contracts for Replacements and Repairs. 

Borrower shall collaterally
assign to Lender as additional security any contract or subcontract for Replacements or Repairs, upon Lender s written request,
on a form of assignment approved by Lender. 

(e)          Indemnification. 

If Lender elects to exercise
its rights under Section 14.03 due to Borrower s failure to timely commence or complete any Replacements or Repairs, Borrower
shall indemnify and hold Lender harmless for, from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses,
damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, arising from or in
any way connected with the performance by Lender of the Replacements or Repairs or investment of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds;
provided that Borrower shall have no indemnity obligation if such actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages,
obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, arise as a result of the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of Lender, Lender s agents, employees, or representatives as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

(f)          Amendments
to Loan Documents. 

Subject to Section 5.02,
Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender, upon written request, an amendment to this Loan Agreement, the Security Instrument,
and any other Loan Document deemed necessary or desirable to perfect Lender s lien upon any portion of the Mortgaged Property
for which Reserve/Escrow Account Funds were expended. 

(g)          Administrative
Fees and Expenses. 

Borrower shall pay to Lender: 

(1)         by
the date specified in the applicable invoice, the Repairs Escrow Account Administrative Fee and the Replacement Reserve Account
Administration Fee for Lender s services in administering the Repairs Escrow Account and Replacement Reserve Account and
investing the funds on deposit in the Repairs Escrow Account and the Replacement Reserve Account, respectively; 

(2)         upon
demand, a reasonable inspection fee, not exceeding the Maximum Inspection Fee, for each inspection of the Mortgaged Property by
Lender in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such
inspections; and 

(3)         upon
demand, all reasonable fees charged by any engineer, architect, inspector or other person inspecting the Mortgaged Property on
behalf of Lender for each inspection of the Mortgaged Property in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable
costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such inspections. 

Section 13.02      Mortgage
Loan Administration Matters Regarding Reserves. 

(a)          Accounts,
Deposits, and Disbursements. 

(1)         Custodial
Accounts.  

(A)         The
Replacement Reserve Account shall be an interest-bearing account that meets the standards for custodial accounts as required by
Lender from time to time. Lender shall not be responsible for any losses resulting from the investment of the Replacement Reserve
Deposits or for obtaining any specific level or percentage of earnings on such investment. All interest, if any, earned on the
Replacement Reserve Deposits shall be added to and become part of the Replacement Reserve Account;  provided ,  however ,
if applicable law requires, and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents,
Lender shall pay to Borrower the interest earned on the Replacement Reserve Account not less frequently than the Replacement Reserve
Account Interest Disbursement Frequency. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the Reserve/Escrow Account
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

(B)         Lender
shall not be obligated to deposit the Repairs Escrow Deposits into an interest-bearing account. 

(2)         Disbursements
by Lender Only.  

Only Lender or
a designated representative of Lender may make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account and the Repairs Escrow Account.
Except as provided in Section 13.02(a)(8), disbursements shall only be made upon Borrower request and after satisfaction of all
conditions for disbursement. 

(3)         Adjustment
to Deposits.  

(A)          Mortgage
Loan Terms Exceeding Ten (10) Years.  

If the Loan Term
exceeds ten (10) years (or five (5) years in the case of any Mortgaged Property that is an  affordable housing property 
as indicated on the Summary of Loan Terms), a property condition assessment shall be ordered by Lender for the Mortgaged Property
at the expense of Borrower (which expense may be paid out of the Replacement Reserve Account if excess funds are available). The
property condition assessment shall be performed no earlier than the sixth (6th) month and no later than the ninth (9th) month
of the tenth (10th) Loan Year and every tenth (10th) Loan Year thereafter if the Loan Term exceeds twenty (20) years (or the fifth
(5th) Loan Year in the case of any Mortgaged Property that is an  affordable housing property  as indicated on the
Summary of Loan Terms and every fifth (5th) Loan Year thereafter if the Loan Term exceeds ten (10) years). After review of the
property condition assessment, the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit may be adjusted by Lender for the remaining
Loan Term by written notice to Borrower so that the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposits are sufficient to fund the Replacements
as and when required and/or the amount to be held in the Repairs Escrow Account may be adjusted by Lender so that the Repairs Escrow
Deposit is sufficient to fund the Repairs as and when required. 

(B)          Transfers.  

In connection with
any Transfer of the Mortgaged Property, the Facility Operating Agreement, or any Transfer of an ownership interest in Borrower,
Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal that requires Lender s consent, Lender may review the amounts on
deposit, if any, in the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve
Deposit and the likely repairs and replacements required by the Mortgaged Property, and the related contingencies which may arise
during the remaining Loan Term. Based upon that review, Lender may require an additional deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account
or the Repairs Escrow Account, or an increase in the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit as a condition to Lender s
consent to such Transfer. 

(4)         Insufficient
Funds.  

Lender may, upon
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Borrower, require an additional deposit(s) to the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs
Escrow Account, or an increase in the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, if Lender determines that the amounts
on deposit in either the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account are not sufficient to cover the costs for Required
Repairs or Required Replacements or, pursuant to the terms of Section 13.02(a)(9), not sufficient to cover the costs for Borrower
Requested Repairs, Additional Lender Repairs, Borrower Requested Replacements, or Additional Lender Replacements. Borrower s
agreement to complete the Replacements or Repairs as required by this Loan Agreement shall not be affected by the insufficiency
of any balance in the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, as applicable. 

(5)         Disbursements
for Replacements and Repairs.  

(A)         Disbursement
requests may only be made after completion of the applicable Replacements and only to reimburse Borrower for the actual approved
costs of the Replacements. Lender shall not disburse from the Replacement Reserve Account the costs of routine maintenance to the
Mortgaged Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from the Repairs Escrow Account or any similar account. Disbursement
from the Replacement Reserve Account shall not be made more frequently than the Maximum Replacement Reserve Disbursement Interval.
Other than in connection with a final request for disbursement, disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account shall not be
less than the Minimum Replacement Reserve Disbursement Amount. 

(B)         Disbursement
requests may only be made after completion of the applicable Repairs and only to reimburse Borrower for the actual cost of the
Repairs, up to the Maximum Repair Cost. Lender shall not disburse any amounts which would cause the funds remaining in the Repairs
Escrow Account after any disbursement (other than with respect to the final disbursement) to be less than the Maximum Repair Cost
of the then-current estimated cost of completing all remaining Repairs. Lender shall not disburse from the Repairs Escrow Account
the costs of routine maintenance to the Mortgaged Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from the Replacement Reserve
Account or any similar account. Disbursement from the Repairs Escrow Account shall not be made more frequently than the Maximum
Repair Disbursement Interval. Other than in connection with a final request for disbursement, disbursements from the Repairs Escrow
Account shall not be less than the Minimum Repairs Disbursement Amount. 

(6)         Disbursement
Requests.  

Each request
by Borrower for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account must be in writing, must specify

conditions for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account, as applicable, have been satisfied. 

Nothing in this Loan Agreement shall
limit Lender s right to require an additional deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account or an increase to the Monthly Replacement
Reserve Deposit in connection with any such Borrower Requested Replacements, or an additional deposit to the Repairs Escrow Account
for any such Borrower Requested Repairs. 

(B)         Additional
Lender Replacements and Additional Lender Repairs.  

Lender may require,
as set forth in Section 6.02(b), Section 6.03(c), or otherwise from time to time, upon written notice to Borrower, that Borrower

(b)          Approvals
of Contracts; Assignment of Claims. 

Lender retains the right
to approve all contracts or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors, contractors, or other parties providing
labor or materials in connection with the Replacements or Repairs. Notwithstanding Borrower s assignment in the Security
Instrument (or Property Operator s assignment pursuant to the SASA) of its rights and claims against all Persons supplying
labor or materials in connection with the Replacement or Repairs, Lender will not pursue any such right or claim unless an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing or as otherwise provided in Section 14.03(c). 

(c)          Delays
and Workmanship. 

If any work for any Replacement
or Repair has not timely commenced, has not been timely performed in a workmanlike manner, or has not been timely completed in
a workmanlike manner, Lender may, without notice to Borrower: 

(1)         withhold
disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account for such unsatisfactory Replacement or Repair, as
applicable; 

(2)         proceed
under existing contracts or contract with third parties to make or complete such Replacement or Repair;

the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account toward the labor and materials necessary to make or complete

any and all other remedies available to Lender under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, including any remedies otherwise
available upon an Event of Default pursuant to the terms of Section 14.02. 

To facilitate Lender s completion or
making of such Replacements or Repairs, Lender shall have the right to enter onto the Mortgaged Property and perform any and all
work and labor necessary to make or complete the Replacements or Repairs and employ watchmen to protect the Mortgaged Property
from damage. All funds so expended by Lender shall be deemed to have been advanced to Borrower, shall be part of the Indebtedness
and shall be secured by the Security Instrument and this Loan Agreement. 

(d)          Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby authorizes
and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c). 

(e)          No
Lender Obligation.

Lender to expend funds, whether from the Replacement Reserve Account, the Repairs Escrow Account, or otherwise, to make or complete
any Replacement or Repair;

Lender to proceed with the Replacements or Repairs; or 

(4)         obligate
Lender to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Replacement or Repair. 

(f)          No
Lender Warranty. 

Lender s approval
of any plans for any Replacement or Repair, release of funds from the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account, inspection
of the Mortgaged Property by Lender or its agents, representatives, or designees, or other acknowledgment of completion of any
Replacement or Repair in a manner satisfactory to Lender shall not be deemed an acknowledgment or warranty to any Person that the
Replacement or Repair has been completed in accordance with applicable building, zoning, or other codes, ordinances, statutes,
laws, regulations, or requirements of any Governmental Authority, such responsibility being at all times exclusively that of Borrower.

in the Mortgaged Property, including a termination, revocation, or suspension of any Licenses; 

(17)        if
Borrower or any Property Operator:

such failure to perform or default in performance, provided, however, such period may be extended for up to an additional thirty
(30) days if Borrower, in the discretion of Lender, is diligently pursuing a cure of such; provided, further, however, no such
written notice, grace period, or extension shall apply if, in Lender s discretion, immediate exercise by Lender of a right
or remedy under this Loan Agreement or any Loan Document is required to avoid harm to Lender or impairment of the Mortgage Loan
(including the Loan Documents), the Mortgaged Property or any other security given for the Mortgage Loan: 

(1)         any
failure by Borrower to perform any of its obligations under this Loan Agreement or any Loan Document (other than those specified
in Section 14.01(a) or Section 14.01(b) above) as and when required. 

Section 14.02      Remedies. 

(a)          Acceleration;
Foreclosure. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, any Accrued Interest, interest accruing
at the Default Rate, the Prepayment Premium (if applicable), and all other Indebtedness, at the option of Lender, shall immediately
become due and payable, without any prior written notice to Borrower, unless applicable law requires otherwise (and in such case,
after any required written notice has been given). Lender may exercise this option to accelerate regardless of any prior forbearance.
In addition, Lender shall have all rights and remedies afforded to Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, including,
foreclosure on and/or the power of sale of the Mortgaged Property, as provided in the Security Instrument, and any rights and remedies
available to Lender at law or in equity (subject to Borrower s statutory rights of reinstatement, if any). Any proceeds of
a Foreclosure Event may be held and applied by Lender as additional collateral for the Indebtedness pursuant to this Loan Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event shall automatically accelerate the Mortgage Loan and all
obligations and Indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable without written notice or further action by Lender. 

(b)          Loss
of Right to Disbursements from Collateral Accounts. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall immediately lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve/Escrow
Accounts and any Collateral Accounts. During the continuance of any such Event of Default, Lender may use the Reserve/Escrow Account
Funds and any Collateral Account Funds (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including: 

(1)         repayment
of the Indebtedness, including principal prepayments and the Prepayment Premium applicable to such full or partial prepayment,
as applicable (however, such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default); 

(2)         reimbursement
of Lender for all losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event
of Default; 

(3)         completion
of the Replacement or Repair or for any other replacement or repair to the Mortgaged Property; and 

(4)         payment
of any amount expended in exercising (and the exercise of) all rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under
this Loan Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents. 

Nothing in this Loan Agreement shall obligate
Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds or Collateral Account Funds on account of any Event of Default
or to repayment of the Indebtedness or in any specific order of priority. 

(c)          Remedies
Cumulative. 

Each right and remedy provided
in this Loan Agreement is distinct from all other rights or remedies under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or afforded
by applicable law, and each shall be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently, independently, or successively, in any order.
Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of additional default by
Borrower in order to exercise any of its remedies with respect to an Event of Default. 

(d)          Operations
upon Event of Default; Lockbox Account. 

(1)         If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: 

(A)         Borrower
shall or shall cause each Property Operator to, at the option of Lender, continue to provide all necessary services required under
each Facility Operating Agreement or applicable licensing or regulatory requirements to operate and manage the Mortgaged Property
as a Seniors Housing Facility and shall fully cooperate with Lender and any receiver as may be appointed by a court, in performing
these services and agrees to arrange for an orderly transition to a replacement property operator or provider of the necessary
services, and to execute promptly all applications, assignments, consents, and documents requested by Lender to facilitate such
transition; and 

(B)         Lender
may cause the removal of Borrower or any Property Operator (as applicable) from any Mortgaged Property operations. Until such time
as Lender has located a replacement property operator, Borrower or the acting Property Operator shall continue to provide all required
services to maintain the Mortgaged Property in full compliance with all License and regulatory requirements. Borrower acknowledges
that its failure to perform or to cause the performance of this service shall constitute a form of waste of the Mortgaged Property,
causing irreparable harm to Lender and the Mortgaged Property, and shall constitute sufficient cause for the appointment of a receiver. 

(2)         In
addition to the remedies set forth herein and elsewhere in the Loan Documents, upon an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled
to mandate the use of a lockbox bank account or other depositary account, to be maintained under the control and supervision of
Lender, for all income of the Mortgaged Property, including Rents, service charges, insurance payments, and Third Party Payments. 

Section 14.03      Additional
Lender Rights; Forbearance. 

(a)          No
Effect Upon Obligations. 

Lender may, but shall not
be obligated to, agree with Borrower, from time to time, and without giving notice to, or obtaining the consent of, or having any
effect upon the obligations of, any Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or other third party obligor, to take any of the
following actions: 

(1)         the
time for payment of the principal of or interest on the Indebtedness may be extended, or the Indebtedness may be renewed in whole
or in part; 

(2)         the
rate of interest on or period of amortization of the Mortgage Loan or the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payments payable under
the Loan Documents may be modified; 

(3)         the
time for Borrower s performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document, whether presently
existing or hereinafter entered into, may be extended or such performance or compliance may be waived; 

(4)         any
or all payments due under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document may be reduced; 

(5)         any
Loan Document may be modified or amended by Lender and Borrower in any respect, including an increase in the principal amount of
the Mortgage Loan; 

(6)         any
amounts under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document may be released; 

(7)         any
security for the Indebtedness may be modified, exchanged, released, surrendered, or otherwise dealt with, or additional security
may be pledged or mortgaged for the Indebtedness; 

(8)         the
payment of the Indebtedness or any security for the Indebtedness, or both, may be subordinated to the right to payment or the security,
or both, of any other present or future creditor of Borrower; or 

(9)         any
other terms of the Loan Documents may be modified. 

(b)          No
Waiver of Rights or Remedies. 

Any waiver of an Event
of Default or forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise
afforded by applicable law, shall not be a waiver of any other Event of Default or preclude the exercise or failure to exercise
of any other right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness after the due date of
such payment, or in an amount which is less than the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender s right to require
prompt payment when due of all other payments on account of the Indebtedness or to exercise any remedies for any failure to make
prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any security for the Indebtedness shall not constitute an election by Lender of remedies
so as to preclude the exercise or failure to exercise of any other right available to Lender. Lender s receipt of any insurance
proceeds or amounts in connection with a Condemnation Action shall not operate to cure or waive any Event of Default. 

(c)          Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby irrevocably
makes, constitutes, and appoints Lender (and any officer of Lender or any Person designated by Lender for that purpose) as Borrower s
true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact (and agent-in-fact) in Borrower s name, place, and stead, with full power of substitution,
to: 

(1)         use
any of the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account for the purpose of making or completing the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(2)         make
such additions, changes, and corrections to the Replacements or Repairs as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(3)         employ
such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects, and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes;

and compromise any claims under any and all policies of insurance required pursuant to this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Document,
subject only to Borrower s rights under this Loan Agreement; 

(6)         appear
in and prosecute any action arising from any insurance policies; 

(7)         collect
and receive the proceeds of insurance, and to deduct from such proceeds Lender s expenses incurred in the collection of such
proceeds; 

(8)         commence,
appear in, and prosecute, in Lender s or Borrower s name, any Condemnation Action; 

(9)         settle
or compromise any claim in connection with any Condemnation Action; 

(10)        execute
all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; 

(11)        prosecute
and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Mortgaged Property or the rehabilitation and repair of the Mortgaged
Property; 

(12)        take
such actions as are permitted in this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Documents; 

(13)        execute
such financing statements and other documents and to do such other acts as Lender may require to perfect and preserve Lender s
security interest in, and to enforce such interests in, the collateral; and 

(14)        carry
out any remedy provided for in this Loan Agreement and any other Loan Documents, including endorsing Borrower s name to checks,
drafts, instruments and other items of payment and proceeds of the collateral, executing change of address forms with the postmaster
of the United States Post Office serving the address of Borrower, changing the address of Borrower to that of Lender, opening all
envelopes addressed to Borrower, and applying any payments contained therein to the Indebtedness. 

Borrower hereby acknowledges that
the constitution and appointment of such proxy and attorney-in-fact are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable and shall
not be affected by the disability or incompetence of Borrower. Borrower specifically acknowledges and agrees that this power of
attorney granted to Lender may be assigned by Lender to Lender s successors or assigns as holder of the Note (and the other
Loan Documents). The foregoing powers conferred on Lender under this Section 14.03(c) shall not impose any duty upon Lender to
exercise any such powers and shall not require Lender to incur any expense or take any action. Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms
all that such attorney-in-fact may do or cause to be done by virtue of any provision of this Loan Agreement and any other Loan
Documents. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions,
Lender shall not exercise its rights as set forth in this Section 14.03(c) unless: (A) an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, or (B) Lender determines, in its discretion, that exigent circumstances exist or that such exercise is necessary or
prudent in order to protect and preserve the Mortgaged Property, or Lender s lien priority and security interest in the Mortgaged
Property. 

(d)          Borrower
Waivers. 

If more than one Person
signs this Loan Agreement as Borrower, each Borrower, with respect to any other Borrower, hereby agrees that Lender, in its discretion,
may: 

(1)         bring
suit against Borrower, or any one or more of Borrower, jointly and severally, or against any one or more of them; 

(2)         compromise
or settle with any one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, for such consideration as Lender may deem proper; 

(3)         release
one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, from liability; or 

(4)         otherwise
deal with Borrower, or any one or more of them, in any manner, and no such action shall impair the rights of Lender to collect
from any Borrower the full amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section 14.04      Waiver
of Marshaling. 

Notwithstanding the existence
of any other security interests in the Mortgaged Property held by Lender or by any other party, Lender shall have the right to
determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged Property shall be subjected to the remedies provided in this Loan Agreement,
any other Loan Document or applicable law. Lender shall have the right to determine the order in which all or any part of the Indebtedness
is satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of such remedies. Borrower and any party who now or in the future acquires
a security interest in the Mortgaged Property and who has actual or constructive notice of this Loan Agreement waives any and all
right to require the marshaling of assets or to require that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in the inverse order of alienation
or that any of the Mortgaged Property be sold in parcels or as an entirety in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies
permitted by applicable law or provided in this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Documents. 

Lender shall account for
any moneys received by Lender in respect of any foreclosure on or disposition of collateral hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents provided that Lender shall not have any duty as to any collateral, and Lender shall be accountable only for amounts that
it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers. NONE OF LENDER OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO BORROWER (a) FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE,
EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE SOLELY TO THEIR OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS FINALLY DETERMINED PURSUANT
TO A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE COURT ORDER BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, NOR (b) FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES.

Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that Borrower solely shall be responsible for (1) causing Property Operator to comply with any notice received by Borrower
from Lender, and (2) promptly providing Lender with copies of notices received by Borrower from Property Operator. Borrower s
compliance with or failure to act as an intermediary as described in this Section 15.02(e) shall not relieve Borrower from its
obligations under this Loan Agreement, nor shall it constitute a defense or excuse for nonperformance by Borrower, Property Operator,
or any Guarantor, as applicable. Lender shall have no obligation to provide any notice to Property Operator unless and until Lender
has taken ownership or control of the Mortgaged Property, or in connection with Lender s exercise of the power of attorney
granted herein, and then only as required by the Loan Documents or the Facility Operating Agreement.

(a)          Binding
Agreement. 

This Loan Agreement shall
bind, and the rights granted by this Loan Agreement shall inure to, the successors and assigns of Lender and the permitted successors
and assigns of Borrower. However, a Transfer not permitted by this Loan Agreement shall be an Event of Default and shall be void
ab initio. 

(b)          Sale
of Mortgage Loan; Change of Servicer. 

Nothing in this Loan Agreement
shall limit Lender s (including its successors and assigns) right to sell or transfer the Mortgage Loan or any interest in
the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan or a partial interest in the Mortgage Loan (together with this Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents) may be sold one or more times without prior written notice to Borrower. A sale may result in a change of the Loan
Servicer. 

Section 15.04      Counterparts.

of Parties; No Third Party Beneficiary. 

(a)          Solely
Creditor and Debtor. 

The relationship between
Lender and Borrower shall be solely that of creditor and debtor, respectively, and nothing contained in this Loan Agreement shall
create any other relationship between Lender and Borrower, nor between Lender and Property Operator. Nothing contained in this
Loan Agreement shall constitute Lender as a joint venturer, partner, or agent of Borrower or Property Operator, or render Lender
liable for any debts, obligations, acts, omissions, representations, or contracts of Borrower or Property Operator. 

(b)          No
Third Party Beneficiaries. 

No creditor of any party
to this Loan Agreement and no other Person shall be a third party beneficiary of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document
or any account created or contemplated under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document. Nothing contained in this Loan Agreement
shall be deemed or construed to create an obligation on the part of Lender to any third party nor shall any third party have a
right to enforce against Lender any right that Borrower may have under this Loan Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing: 

(1)         any
Servicing Arrangement between Lender and any Loan Servicer shall constitute a contractual obligation of such Loan Servicer that
is independent of the obligation of Borrower for the payment of the Indebtedness; 

(2)         Borrower
shall not be a third party beneficiary of any Servicing Arrangement; and 

(3)         no
payment by the Loan Servicer under any Servicing Arrangement will reduce the amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section 15.07      Severability;
Entire Agreement; Amendments. 

The invalidity or unenforceability
of any provision of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, all of which shall remain in full force and effect, including the
Guaranty. This Loan Agreement contains the complete and entire agreement among the parties as to the matters covered, rights granted,
and the obligations assumed in this Loan Agreement. This Loan Agreement may not be amended or modified except by written agreement
signed by the parties hereto.

(a)          The
captions and headings of the sections of this Loan Agreement and the Loan Documents are for convenience only and shall be disregarded
in construing this Loan Agreement and the Loan Documents. 

(b)          Any
reference in this Loan Agreement to an  Exhibit  or  Schedule  or a  Section  or an  Article 
shall, unless otherwise explicitly provided, be construed as referring, respectively, to an Exhibit or Schedule attached to this
Loan Agreement or to a Section or Article of this Loan Agreement. 

(c)          Any

of the singular in this Loan Agreement includes the plural and use of the plural includes the singular. 

(e)          As
used in this Loan Agreement, the term  including  means  including, but not limited to  or  including,
without limitation,  and is for example only and not a limitation. 

(f)          Whenever
Borrower s knowledge is implicated in this Loan Agreement or the phrase  to Borrower s knowledge  or a
similar phrase is used in this Loan Agreement, Borrower s knowledge or such phrase(s) shall be interpreted to mean to the
best of Borrower s knowledge after reasonable and diligent inquiry and investigation. 

(g)          Unless
otherwise provided in this Loan Agreement, if Lender s approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate, action,
or decision is required, permitted, or contemplated hereunder, such approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate,
action or decision shall be made in Lender s sole and absolute discretion. 

(h)          All
references in this Loan Agreement to a separate instrument or agreement shall include such instrument or agreement as the same
may be amended or supplemented from time to time pursuant to the applicable provisions thereof. 

(i)           Lender
may  shall mean at Lender s discretion, but shall not be an obligation. 

(j)          If
the Mortgage Loan proceeds are disbursed on a date that is later than the Effective Date, as described in Section 2.02(a)(1), the
representations and warranties in the Loan Documents with respect to the ownership and operation of the Mortgaged Property shall
be deemed to be made as of the disbursement date. 

(k)          Any
references in this Loan Agreement to a Senior Housing Facility shall refer to the Mortgaged Property identified on the Summary
of Loan Terms including the Seniors Housing Facility Licensing Designation. 

(l)          Each
reference to  tenant  or  tenants  in the Loan Documents shall be interpreted to mean  subtenant 
or  subtenants  where the context so indicates. 

Section 15.09      Mortgage
Loan Servicing. 

All actions regarding the
servicing of the Mortgage Loan, including the collection of payments, the giving and receipt of notice, inspections of the Mortgaged
Property, inspections of books and records, and the granting of consents and approvals, may be taken by the Loan Servicer unless
Borrower receives notice to the contrary. If Borrower receives conflicting notices regarding the identity of the Loan Servicer
or any other subject, any such written notice from Lender shall govern. The Loan Servicer may change from time to time (whether
related or unrelated to a sale of the Mortgage Loan). If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written
notice of the change. 

Section 15.10      Disclosure
of Information. 

Lender may furnish information
regarding Borrower, Property Operator, Key Principal, Guarantor, or the Mortgaged Property to third parties with an existing or
prospective interest in the servicing, enforcement, evaluation, performance, purchase, or securitization of the Mortgage Loan,
including trustees, master servicers, special servicers, rating agencies, and organizations maintaining databases on the underwriting
and performance of multifamily mortgage loans. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all rights it may have under applicable law
to prohibit such disclosure, including any right of privacy. 

Section 15.11      Waiver;
Conflict. 

No specific waiver of any
of the terms of this Loan Agreement shall be considered as a general waiver. If any provision of this Loan Agreement is in conflict
with any provision of any other Loan Document, the provision contained in this Loan Agreement shall control.

understands the nature and structure of the transactions contemplated by this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents; 

(b)          it
is familiar with the provisions of all of the documents and instruments relating to such transactions; 

(c)          it
understands the risks inherent in such transactions, including the risk of loss of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property; 

(d)          it
has had the opportunity to consult counsel; and 

(e)          it

by this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise relied on Lender in any manner in connection with interpreting,
entering into, or otherwise in connection with this Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any of the matters contemplated
hereby or thereby. 

Section 15.13      Subrogation. 

If, and to the extent that,
the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan are used to pay, satisfy, or discharge any obligation of Borrower or Property Operator for the
payment of money that is secured by a pre-existing mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien encumbering the Mortgaged Property, such
Mortgage Loan proceeds shall be deemed to have been advanced by Lender at Borrower s request, and Lender shall automatically,
and without further action on its part, be subrogated to the rights, including lien priority, of the owner or holder of the obligation
secured by such prior lien, whether or not such prior lien is released. 

Section 15.14      Counting
of Days. 

Except where otherwise
specifically provided, any reference in this Loan Agreement to a period of  days  means calendar days, not Business
Days. If the date on which Borrower is required to perform an obligation under this Loan Agreement is not a Business Day, Borrower
shall be required to perform such obligation by the Business Day immediately preceding such date; provided, however, in respect
of any Payment Date, or if the Maturity Date is other than a Business Day, Borrower shall be obligated to make such payment by
the Business Day immediately following such date. 

Section 15.15      Revival
and Reinstatement of Indebtedness. 

If the payment of all or
any part of the Indebtedness by Borrower, Property Operator, any Guarantor, or any other Person, or the transfer to Lender of any
collateral or other property should for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law
relating to creditors  rights, including provisions of the Insolvency Laws relating to a Voidable Transfer, and if Lender
is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the advice of its counsel,
then the amount of such Voidable Transfer or the amount of such Voidable Transfer that Lender is required or elects to repay or
restore, including all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys  fees incurred by Lender in connection therewith, and the
Indebtedness shall be automatically revived, reinstated, and restored by such amount and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer
had never been made. 

Section 15.16      Time
is of the Essence. 

Borrower agrees that, with
respect to each and every obligation and covenant contained in this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, time is of the
essence.

are merged into this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents. This Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any of their
provisions may not be waived, modified, amended, discharged, or terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by the party
against which the enforcement of the waiver, modification, amendment, discharge, or termination is sought, and then only to the
extent set forth in that agreement.

SCHEDULE 3 TO 

  MULTIFAMILY LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  

Schedule of Interest Rate Type Provisions 

 (Structured ARM (1 and 3 Month LIBOR))
and Fixed Rate Conversion Option 

1.  Defined Terms. 

Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in this Schedule have the meanings given to such terms in the Definitions Schedule to the Loan Agreement. 

2.  Interest Accrual. 

Except as otherwise provided
in the Loan Agreement, interest shall accrue at the Adjustable Rate until the Mortgage Loan is fully paid. 

3.  Adjustable Rate; Adjustments. 

The Initial Adjustable
Rate shall be effective until the first Rate Change Date. Thereafter, the Adjustable Rate shall change on each Rate Change Date
based on fluctuations in the Current Index. 

4.  Fixed Monthly Principal Component. 

Each amortizing Monthly
Debt Service Payment shall include a principal payment equal to the Fixed Monthly Principal Component, which shall be determined
using the Fixed Rate Amortization Factor. 

5.  Notification of Interest Rate Change and Monthly Debt Service
Payment. 

Before each Payment Change
Date, Lender shall notify Borrower of any change in the Adjustable Rate and the amount of the next Monthly Debt Service Payment. 

6.  Correction to Monthly Debt Service Payments. 

If Lender determines at
any time that it has miscalculated the amount of a Monthly Debt Service Payment (whether because of a miscalculation of the Adjustable
Rate or otherwise), then Lender shall give notice to Borrower of the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment (and
the corrected Adjustable Rate, if applicable) and (a) if the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents an
increase, then Borrower shall, within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, pay to Lender any sums that Borrower would have otherwise
been obligated to pay to Lender had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated, or (b) if the corrected
amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents a decrease and Borrower is not otherwise in default under any of the Loan
Documents, then Borrower shall thereafter be paid the sums that Borrower would not have otherwise been obligated to pay to Lender
had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated. 

7.  Conversion to Fixed Rate. 

(a)    Conversion Option.  

(1)         Subject
to the following terms and conditions, Borrower may exercise the Conversion Option pursuant to which the interest rate payable
on the Mortgage Loan may be converted, one (1) time only, on any Payment Date during the Conversion Period from the Adjustable
Rate to the Fixed Rate, after which the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan shall remain at the Fixed Rate until the New Maturity
Date. 

(2)         For
Mortgage Loans that are full-term interest-only, the Amortization Period from and after the Conversion Effective Date shall be
three hundred sixty (360) months. For all other Mortgage Loans, including Mortgage Loans that are partial interest-only or amortizing,
the Amortization Period from and after the Conversion Effective Date shall be: 

(A)         three
hundred sixty (360) months, if (i) Borrower selects a Fixed Rate Option having a term greater than or equal to the original term
of the Mortgage Loan from the Effective Date through the Maturity Date, and (ii) the most recent inspection of the Mortgaged Property
by Lender resulted in a rating of either  1  or  2  or 

(B)         in
all other cases, the number of months equal to (A) three hundred sixty (360) months, minus (B) the number of Monthly Debt Service
Payments that have elapsed since the Effective Date. 

(3)         The
Monthly Debt Service Payment following a Conversion shall be in an amount required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan immediately prior to the Initial Fixed Rate Payment Date in equal monthly installments, including accrued interest at the
Fixed Rate, over the Amortization Period utilizing the 30/360 Interest Accrual Method even if Actual/360 is the Interest Accrual
Method. 

(4)         The
Conversion Option shall lapse (A) at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the expiration of the Conversion
Period if Borrower has not previously delivered to Lender an NOI Determination Request in accordance with the terms of this Schedule
or (B) on the Conversion Effective Date, if the Conversion Option is timely exercised but the Fixed Rate does not become effective
on such Conversion Effective Date. 

(5)         It
is anticipated that the Conversion will be effected by the issuance by Lender of a fixed-rate MBS or by the cash purchase of the
Mortgage Loan by Lender into its portfolio (subject to the provisions of Section 7(b)(2) of this Schedule). Borrower acknowledges,
however, that the Conversion is contingent on the capital markets generally, and that from time to time, disruptions in the capital
markets may make Conversion infeasible. In the event Lender is not able to obtain any quotes for the Mortgage Loan at the Fixed
Rate (and does not make a cash bid for the Mortgage Loan), or if the quotes exceed the Maximum Fixed Rate, the interest rate on
the Mortgage Loan shall remain at the Adjustable Rate. 

(b)    Procedures for Conversion.  

(1)    NOI Determination Request.  

(A)         Subject
to the terms of the Loan Agreement, if Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option, Borrower shall submit an NOI Determination
Request to Lender, which shall include Borrower s selection of a Fixed Rate Option. 

(B)         The
NOI Determination Request shall be accompanied by the Conversion Review Fee in the form of a check payable to Lender or by wire
transfer to an account designated by Lender. 

(C)         In
no event shall the NOI Determination Request be made prior to the commencement of the Conversion Period or less than ninety (90)
days prior to the expiration of the Conversion Period. Borrower may not submit an NOI Determination Request if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing at the time of the request or if an Event of Default has occurred at any time within the twelve
(12) month period immediately preceding the date of Borrower s request. In addition, Borrower may not submit an NOI Determination
Request more than twice in any Loan Year. Borrower shall submit to Lender, within five (5) days after receipt of a request therefor,
all information relating to the operation of the Mortgaged Property required by Lender to determine the Net Operating Income and
Borrower s compliance with Section 7 of this Schedule. If Borrower fails to provide such information within such period,
Borrower s NOI Determination Request shall be deemed canceled (however, such canceled NOI Determination Request shall count
as a request for the Loan Year in which the request was made). 

(2)    Conversion Eligibility Determination.  

(A)         Within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of an NOI Determination Request (or, if Lender requests additional information from Borrower pursuant
to Section 7(b)(2)(B) of this Schedule, within fifteen (15) days after Lender s receipt of such additional information),
Lender shall determine the Net Operating Income of the Mortgaged Property and the Maximum Fixed Rate to which the Mortgage Loan
may be converted and shall provide Borrower with the NOI Determination Notice. 

(B)         Lender
shall determine the Net Operating Income for the trailing twelve (12) month period on the basis of the most recently received quarterly
financial statements (as such statements may be adjusted by Lender as necessary to accurately reflect items of income, operating
expenses, ground lease payments, if applicable, and replacement reserves to reflect suitable underwriting) prepared by Borrower
for the Mortgaged Property. In connection with any request by Lender for additional information, Borrower shall have five (5) days
after Borrower s receipt of such request to provide Lender with such additional information. 

(C)         Borrower
may not exercise the Conversion Option unless Lender determines that, based upon the Net Operating Income set forth in the NOI
Determination Notice and the Fixed Rate quoted in connection with a Rate Lock Request, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
Mortgaged Property is equal to or greater than the Minimum Conversion Debt Service Coverage Ratio. 

(3)    Exercise of Conversion Option; Rate Lock Request.  

(A)         If,
after receipt of the NOI Determination Notice, Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option, Borrower shall, within fifteen
(15) days of Borrower s receipt of the NOI Determination Notice: 

(i)          provide
Lender with a title report for the Mortgaged Property prepared by, or by an agent for, the issuer of the Title Policy, showing
marketable fee simple or leasehold title to the Mortgaged Property (as applicable) to be vested in Borrower, free and clear of
all Liens and other matters affecting title other than the Permitted Encumbrances; 

(ii)         pay
to Lender the Good Faith Deposit; and 

(iii)        make
a Rate Lock Request. 

(B)         If
the Conversion closes, Lender shall refund the Good Faith Deposit to Borrower within thirty (30) days after the Conversion Closing
Date. If Borrower pays the Good Faith Deposit but does not timely exercise the Conversion Option and the Fixed Rate is not rate
locked, Lender shall refund the Good Faith Deposit to Borrower within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a written request from
Borrower (and the interest rate shall remain at the Adjustable Rate). If Borrower timely exercises the Conversion Option, but the
Conversion is not consummated for any reason other than a default by Lender in performing its obligations under the Loan Agreement,
Borrower shall forfeit the Good Faith Deposit and (i) if the MBS Investor is not Fannie Mae, shall be fully liable for, and agrees
to pay on demand, any and all loss, costs and/or damages incurred by Lender in connection with Borrower s failure to consummate
the Conversion as provided herein, including any loss, costs and/or damages incurred by Lender in excess of the Good Faith Deposit,
and (ii) if the MBS Investor is Fannie Mae or if the converted Mortgage Loan is held by Fannie Mae and does not back an MBS, the
Good Faith Deposit shall serve as liquidated damages resulting from failure to consummate the Conversion. Borrower expressly acknowledges
that by electing to convert the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan to the Fixed Rate, and agreeing to the Fixed Rate as provided
herein, Borrower is causing Lender to take a position in the financial markets in reliance thereon, and the failure of Borrower
to convert the interest rate on the Mortgage Loan to the Fixed Rate as provided herein may cause Lender to incur economic damages. 

(C)         If
Borrower desires to exercise the Conversion Option and has complied with all other requirements of Section 7(d) of this Schedule,
within fifteen (15) days of Borrower s receipt of the NOI Determination Notice, Borrower shall contact Lender to initiate
a Rate Lock Request. If the Fixed Rate quoted to Borrower is greater than the Maximum Fixed Rate, Borrower shall not be permitted
to accept the quoted Fixed Rate (or exercise its Conversion Option). On or before 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) of the day Borrower
accepts the quoted Fixed Rate, Borrower and Lender shall confirm to each other (by letter addressed from Lender to Borrower, acknowledged
and accepted in writing by Borrower and transmitted, in each case, by facsimile or other electronic transmission acceptable to
Lender), (i) the Fixed Rate, (ii) the New Maturity Date (if applicable), (iii) the Conversion Effective Date, (iv) the new Monthly
Debt Service Payment and (v) the Initial Fixed Rate Payment Date. 

(c)    Amendment to Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement.  

The Conversion
shall be evidenced by the Conversion Amendment. 

(d)    Conditions Precedent to Closing of Conversion.  

Borrower s
right to consummate the Conversion and Lender s obligation to execute and deliver the Conversion Amendment, shall be subject
to satisfaction of the conditions precedent below. 

(1)         All
representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on
and as of the Conversion Closing Date as though made on and as of the Conversion Closing Date. 

(2)         Borrower
shall have performed or complied with all of its obligations under the Loan Agreement to be performed or complied with on or before
the Conversion Closing Date. 

(3)         On
the Conversion Closing Date, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or any event which, with the giving of
notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). 

(4)         On
the Conversion Closing Date, Lender shall have received all of the following, each of which, where applicable, shall be executed
by individuals authorized to do so, shall be dated as of the Closing Date, and shall be in form and substance acceptable to Lender: 

(A)         the
Conversion Amendment; 

(B)         an
endorsement to the Title Policy or a new Title Policy as of the Conversion Closing Date showing that the Security Instrument constitutes
a valid mortgage lien on the Mortgaged Property, with the same lien priority insured by the Title Policy, subject only to the Permitted
Encumbrances; 

(C)         either
(i) the Survey, redated to a date within fifteen (15) days prior to the Conversion Closing Date showing that there are no Liens
or other matters that have arisen since the date of the Survey other than matters approved in writing by Lender, or (ii) affirmative
coverage in the title insurance endorsement referred to in Section 7(d)(4)(B) that there are no exceptions based upon the results
of a visual inspection of the Mortgaged Property, or the absence of any exception based upon any facts or conditions which have
arisen since the date of the Survey and which would be disclosed by a current survey of the Mortgaged Property; 

(D)         if
necessary, as determined by Lender, an amendment to the Security Instrument to be recorded in the land records and insured as a
supplement to the Security Instrument to reflect the New Maturity Date; 

(E)         an
opinion of counsel satisfactory to Lender as to such matters as Lender may reasonably request; and 

(F)         such
other documents as Lender may reasonably request related to the Loan Agreement, the Conversion Amendment or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. 

(5)         The
Mortgaged Property shall not have been damaged, destroyed or subject to any condemnation or other taking, in whole or any material
part, and Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower, dated as of the Conversion Closing Date, to such effect. 

8.  Property Condition Assessment. 

Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 13.02(a)(3)(A), if the Conversion Option is exercised for any Mortgaged Property other than an  affordable housing
property  (as indicated on the Summary of Loan Terms), and extends the Loan Term, then a new property condition assessment
shall be required in the earlier of (a) the Loan Year that would have been the final Loan Year of the Mortgage Loan had the Conversion
Option not been exercised, or (b) the tenth (10th) Loan Year.

any creditor, and each Borrower has received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under the Loan Documents.
Giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, the fair saleable value of each Borrower s assets
exceeds and will, immediately following the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, be greater than such Borrower s
probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities or its debts as such debts become absolute and
mature. Each Borrower s assets do not and, immediately following the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents will not,
constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. No Borrower intends
to, and does not believe that it will, incur debts and liabilities (including, without limitation, contingent liabilities and
other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts to be payable
on or in respect of obligations of each Borrower).  

(ff)          After
consultation with counsel concerning the federal anti-kickback law (42 U.S.C.A. SEC. 1320a-7b(b)), neither any Borrower nor its
agent have offered or given any remuneration or thing of value to any person to encourage referral to the Projects nor has any
Borrower or its agent solicited or received any remuneration or thing of value in exchange for any Borrower s agreement
to make referrals or to purchase goods or services for the Projects.  

(gg)        Except
for indirect ownership interests in any Borrower as a result of ownership of publicly traded shares of stock in Sentio, no physician
or other healthcare practitioner has an ownership interest in any Borrower, any Project or, to the best of Borrowers  knowledge,
any Operator.  

(hh)        No
Borrower nor its Operator has granted to any third party the right to reduce the number of licensed beds in any Project or to
apply for approval to transfer the right to any or all of the licensed beds to any other location.

(ii)          No
Borrower nor any Guarantor or Project is currently the subject of any proceeding by any governmental agency, and no notice of
any violation has been received by any Borrower or Guarantor from any federal, state or local government or quasi-governmental
body or agency or any administrative or investigative body that would, directly or indirectly, or with the passage of time:  

(i)           have
a material adverse impact on a Borrower s or an Operator s ability to accept and/or retain residents or result in
the imposition of a fine, a sanction, a lower rate certification or a lower reimbursement rate for services rendered to eligible
residents;  

(ii)          modify,
limit or annul or result in the transfer, suspension, revocation or imposition of probationary use of any of the permits; or  

(iii)         affect
a Borrower s continued participation in Third-Party Payors  Programs, or any successor programs thereto, at current

3.2.       Survival
                                         of Representations and Warranties.    

Each
Borrower agrees that all of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 and elsewhere in this Agreement are true
as of the date hereof, will be true at the Loan Opening and, except for matters which have been disclosed by Borrowers and approved
by Agent in writing, at all times thereafter. Each request for a disbursement under the Loan Documents from the Holdback shall
constitute a reaffirmation of such representations and warranties, as deemed modified in accordance with the disclosures made
and approved as aforesaid, as of the date of such request. It shall be a condition precedent to the Loan Opening and each subsequent
disbursement that each of said representations and warranties is true and correct as of the date of such requested disbursement.
Each disbursement from the Holdback shall be deemed to be a reaffirmation by Borrowers that each of the representations and warranties
is true and correct as of the date of such disbursement. In addition, at Lender s request, Borrowers shall reaffirm such
representations and warranties in writing prior to each disbursement hereunder.

  LOAN AND LOAN DOCUMENTS    

4.1.       Agreement
                                         to Borrow and Lend; Lenders  Obligation to Disburse.    

Subject
to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrowers agree to borrow from the Lenders
and each Lender agrees to lend to Borrowers the Loan, for the purposes and subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions
contained in this Agreement. If more than one Lender is a party hereto, the obligations of each such Lender with respect to the
amount it has agreed to loan to Borrowers shall be several (and not joint and several) and shall be limited to its proportionate
share of the Loan and of each advance.  

(a)          The
maximum aggregate amount of the Loan shall not exceed the lesser of (i) Sixty-Two Million Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($62,050,000.00),
(ii) the sum of 70% of the  as-stabilized  fair market value for the Projects as determined in an Appraisal, and (iii)
such amount as will result in a Debt Service Coverage of at least 1.70 to 1.00 calculated based upon the  as-stabilized 
NOI for each Project as shown in an Appraisal. The Loan will be funded in one or more advances commencing on the Loan Opening
Date. The Loan is non-revolving, and amounts repaid hereunder shall not be available for further borrowing hereunder.  

(b)          The
Lenders agree, upon Borrowers  compliance with and satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the Loan Opening and provided
no Material Adverse Change has occurred with respect to any Borrower, Guarantor or Project and no default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing hereunder, to open the Loan, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, and fund a first
advance of $56,950,000.00 (the   Initial Funding  ) of the Loan in connection with the Projects. The remaining
$5,100,000.00 of the Loan (the   Holdback ) shall be available to Borrowers as follows: (i) $2,550,000.00 upon the
Sumter Grand Project achieving an annualized NOI for three consecutive months of at least $2,575,000.00 and satisfying all other
conditions precedent to the First Tier Earnout Payment (as defined in the Earnout Agreement) set forth in  Section 2.1  of
the Earnout Agreement; and (ii) an additional $2,550,000.00 upon the Sumter Grand Project achieving an annualized NOI for three
consecutive months of at least $2,875,000.00 and satisfying all other conditions precedent to the Second Tier Earnout Payment
(as defined in the Earnout Agreement) set forth in  Section 2.2  of the Earnout Agreement, in each case subject to the conditions
set forth in (c) below.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  16     

(c)          After
the Loan Opening Date, Borrowers shall be entitled to additional advances of the Holdback upon receipt of written request for
disbursement and satisfaction of the conditions thereto as set forth herein. Within seven (7) Business Days after the written
request by Borrowers for the disbursement by Lenders of any portion of the Holdback, the Lenders shall fund the requested amount
of the Holdback to Borrowers, provided that (i) no Material Adverse Change has occurred with respect to any Borrower, Guarantor
or Project, (ii) no Event of Default and no material default exists hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (iii) Agent does
not reasonably expect the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the stepped up minimum Debt Service Coverage covenants
specified in  Section 10.1(x)  and  Schedule II  for the subsequent two quarterly reporting periods, (iv) all representations
and warranties of Borrowers hereunder shall be deemed remade as of the requested date of funding, and (v) Agent has received evidence
satisfactory to Agent that all conditions set forth in  Section 8.1  and  8.3  are fully satisfied as of the applicable
disbursement date. For the avoidance of doubt, the criteria set forth in clause (iii) shall be considered met if the Projects'
performance in the trailing three month period would not result in an Event of Default with respect to the stepped up minimum
Debt Service Coverage covenants specified in  Section 10.1 (x)  and  Schedule II  for the subsequent two quarterly reporting
periods.  

(d)          Borrowers
and each Operator shall open two deposit accounts for each Project with Agent (each such account of Borrowers shall be a   Project
Rent Account   and of Operators shall be a   Project Operating Account  ); provided, however, that for
the Mesa Vista Project, Mesa Vista Borrower shall open a Project Rent Account only. Thereafter, all rent received by Borrowers
under the Operating Leases shall be deposited in the Project Rent Accounts and all cash flow from each Project received by Operators
shall be deposited in the applicable Project Operating Account. During the existence of an Event of Default, all such rent and
cash flow shall be available for payment of debt service on the Loan, and Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders, is authorized
to pay principal or interest due upon the Notes during the existence of an Event of Default as well as real estate taxes if the
same are not paid by the applicable Borrower or Operator prior to delinquency by debiting funds on deposit in the Project Rent
Accounts and the Project Operating Accounts. Unless an Event of Default shall exist, Borrowers and Operators shall have access
to and may use any or all the funds then held in the Project Rent Accounts or the Project Operating Accounts, respectively, for
any lawful purpose which shall include, without limitation, payment of the operating expenses for the Projects, dividends, distributions
or any other costs or expenses of Borrowers or Guarantors as permitted under the provisions of this Agreement, including, without
limitation,  Section 10.1(w) .  

Each
Borrower agrees that it will, on or before the Loan Opening Date, execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to
Agent the following documents in form and substance acceptable to Agent:  

(a)          One
or more promissory notes (the   Notes  ), in the maximum amount of the Loan (less the Sumter Grand Allocation),
executed by Borrowers and payable to the order of each Lender in the amount of such Lender s Commitment and the Sumter Grand
Note.  

(b)          The
Mortgages.  

(c)          A
Guaranty Agreement ( the   Guaranty  ) executed by Sentio and Sentio OP and pursuant to which Sentio and Sentio
OP guarantee the  Guaranteed Indebtedness,  as such term is therein defined.  

(d)          One
Payment Guaranty from each Operator (collectively the   Operator Guaranty  ) pursuant to which each Operator
guarantees, on a joint and several basis, the  Guaranteed Indebtedness  as such term is therein defined.  

(e)          One
environmental indemnity for each Project (collectively, the   Indemnity  ) from the applicable Borrower and Guarantors
indemnifying Agent and the Lenders with regard to all matters related to Hazardous Materials and other environmental matters for
each such Project.  

(f)          The
Assignments of Rents.  

(g)          A
security agreement executed by the Operators pursuant to which the Operators pledge all of their interests in the Project as collateral
security for the obligations of Borrowers under the Loan Documents.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  17     

(h)          Such
UCC financing statements as Agent s counsel determines are advisable or necessary to perfect or notify third parties of
the security interests intended to be created by the Loan Documents.  

(i)           Such
other documents, instruments or certificates as Agent and its counsel may reasonably require, including such documents as Agent
in its sole discretion deems necessary or appropriate to effectuate the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents,
and to comply with the laws of the State.  

(a)          Unless
the Loan is otherwise earlier accelerated as permitted herein or under any other Loan Document, all principal, interest and other
sums due under the Loan Documents shall be due and payable in full on the Original Maturity Date, subject to the Extension Option.
The terms and provisions of this  Section 4.3  (and any extension of the Original Maturity Date pursuant hereto) shall
not constitute a waiver of the requirement that any modification of the Note or any of the Loan Documents shall require the express
written approval of Agent, no such approval (either expressed or implied) having been given as of the date hereof (other than
as expressly set forth herein). The Extension Option shall automatically expire and terminate, and shall thereafter be null and
void, if Borrowers do not duly elect such Extension Option expressly in accordance therewith.  

(b)          Borrowers
shall have the right to extend the Original Maturity Date through the Extended Maturity Date (  Extension Option  )
provided that Borrowers satisfy the following conditions precedent:  

(i)           The
delivery by Borrowers to Agent not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Original Maturity Date (but not more than ninety (90)
days prior to such Original Maturity Date) of written notice of Borrower s election to exercise the extension of the Original
Maturity Date (which notice shall also represent and warrant that as of the date thereof there shall exist no uncured Event of
Default or any event which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, would constitute an Event of Default;  

(ii)          The
delivery by Borrowers to Agent of evidence satisfactory to Agent that, as of the three month period ending on the last day of
the most recently ended month, the Debt Service Coverage is at least 1.70 to 1.00, provided, however, that Borrowers shall have
the right to prepay to Agent a portion of the Loan in an amount sufficient to cause such Debt Service Coverage requirement to
be satisfied;  

(iii)         As
of the Original Maturity Date, there shall exist no uncured Event of Default or any event which, with the passage of time or the
giving of notice, would constitute an Event of Default;  

(iv)         Borrowers
shall, on the Original Maturity Date, pay to Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, of an extension fee in an amount equal to
the product of twenty-five basis points (0.25%) times the Loan Amount; and  

(v)          Borrowers
shall pay all reasonable expenses not to exceed $5,000.00, including (without limitation) reasonable attorneys  fees and
legal expenses, incurred by Agent in connection with determining whether the conditions set forth in this Agreement are fully
satisfied and the resulting granting of or refusal to grant the Extension Option by the Lenders (and in connection with the preparation
and execution of any documentation therefor).  

Borrowers
shall have the right to make prepayments of the Loan, in whole or in part, without prepayment penalty other than any Breakage
Costs so long as each such prepayment is made (i) upon not less than seven (7) days  prior written notice to Agent, and
(ii) in minimum increments of $500,000.00. No prepayment of all or part of the Loan shall be permitted unless same is made together
with the payment of all interest accrued on the Loan through the date of prepayment and an amount equal to all Breakage Costs
and attorneys  fees and disbursements incurred by each Lender as a result of the prepayment.

4.5.       Required
                                         Principal Payments.    

In
addition to and not in lieu of each monthly interest payment required under  Section 5.1(a) , principal under the Notes shall
be due and payable in monthly installments, commencing on August 10, 2018, and continuing on the tenth (10 th ) day of
each successive month thereafter until the Final Maturity Date. Each such installment shall be in an amount sufficient to fully
amortize the Loan on a thirty (30) year amortization schedule at per annum interest rate of six percent (6.0%). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the aggregate outstanding balance of the Loan plus all accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and
payable in full on the Final Maturity Date.  

Any
and all amounts due hereunder or under the other Loan Documents which remain unpaid more than ten (10) days after the date said
amount was due and payable shall incur a fee (the   Late Charge  ) of four percent (4%) of said amount, which
payment shall be in addition to all of Lenders  other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, provided that no Late
Charge shall apply to the final payment of principal on the Final Maturity Date.  

ARTICLE 5  
  INTEREST    

(a)          The
Loan will bear interest at the Applicable Rate, unless the Default Rate is applicable. Except as expressly provided herein, the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be the  Applicable Rate . Borrowers shall pay interest in arrears on the tenth (10 th )
day of every calendar month in the amount of all interest accrued and unpaid. All payments (whether of principal or of interest)
shall be deemed credited to Borrowers  account only if received by 12:00 noon Brooklyn, Ohio, time on a Business Day; otherwise,
such payment shall be deemed received on the next Business Day.  

(b)          If
Agent determines in its reasonable discretion (i) that Dollar deposits in an amount approximately equal to the Loan for the designated
LIBOR Rate Interest Period are not generally available at such time in the London interbank market for deposits in Dollars, (ii)
that the rate at which such deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lenders of maintaining
a LIBOR Rate on such portion of the Loan or of funding the same for such LIBOR Rate Interest Period due to circumstances affecting
the London interbank market generally, (iii) that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining a LIBOR Rate, or (iv) that an
Adjusted LIBOR Rate would be in excess of the maximum interest rate which Borrowers may by law pay, then, in any such event, Agent
shall so notify Borrowers and all portions of the Loan bearing interest at an Adjusted LIBOR Rate that are so affected shall,
as of the date of such notification with respect to an event described in clause (ii) or (iv) above, or as of the expiration of
the applicable LIBOR Rate Interest Period with respect to an event described in clause (i) or (iii) above, bear interest at the
Adjusted Base Rate (or such lower rate as required by applicable law) until such time as the situations described above are no
longer in effect or can be avoided, at which time the Loan shall again accrue interest at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate. At no time
may there be more than three (3) LIBOR Rate Interest Periods in effect with respect to the Loan.  

(c)          Interest
at the Applicable Rate (or Default Rate) shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year,
including the first date of the applicable period to, but not including, the date of repayment.  

(d)          Borrowers
shall pay all Breakage Costs incurred from time to time by Lenders upon demand.  

(e)          If
the introduction of or any change in any Law, regulation or treaty, or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof, shall make it unlawful for Lender to maintain the Applicable Rate at
an Adjusted LIBOR Rate with respect to the Loan or any portion thereof, or to fund the Loan or any portion thereof in Dollars
in the London interbank market, or to give effect to its obligations regarding the accrual of interest on the Loan at the Adjusted
LIBOR Rate as contemplated by the Loan Documents, then (1) Agent shall notify Borrowers that Lenders are no longer able to maintain
the Applicable Rate at an Adjusted LIBOR Rate, (2) the Applicable Rate for any portion of the Loan for which the Applicable Rate
is then an Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall automatically be converted to the Adjusted Base Rate, and (3) Borrowers shall pay to Agent
the amount of Breakage Costs (if any) incurred in connection with such conversion. Thereafter, the Loan shall accrue interest
at the Adjusted Base Rate until such time as the situation described herein is no longer in effect or can be avoided, at which
time the Loan shall again accrue interest at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  19     

(f)           The
Loan shall bear interest at the Default Rate upon the election of the Lenders at any time at which an Event of Default shall exist.  

ARTICLE 6  
  COSTS OF MAINTAINING LOAN    

6.1.       Increased
                                         Costs and Capital Adequacy.    

(a)          Borrowers
recognize that the cost to the Lenders of maintaining the Loan or any portion thereof may fluctuate and, Borrowers agree to pay
Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders additional amounts to compensate the Lenders for any increase in its actual costs
incurred in maintaining the Loan or any portion thereof outstanding or for the reduction of any amounts received or receivable
from Borrowers as a result of:  

(i)          any
change after the date hereof in any applicable Law, regulation or treaty, or in the interpretation or administration thereof,
or by any domestic or foreign court, (A) changing the basis of taxation of payments under this Agreement to Agent (other than
taxes imposed on all or any portion of the overall net income or receipts of any Lender), or (B) imposing, modifying or applying
any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, credit extended by,
or any other acquisition of funds for loans by Lenders (which includes the Loan or any applicable portion thereof), or (C) imposing
on any Lender, or the London interbank market generally, any other condition affecting the Loan, provided that the result of the
foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of maintaining the Loan or any portion thereof or to reduce the amount of any
sum received or receivable from Borrower by Lenders under the Loan Documents; or  

(ii)          the
maintenance by any Lender of reserves in accordance with reserve requirements promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System of the United States with respect to  Eurocurrency Liabilities  of a similar term to that of the applicable
portion of the Loan (without duplication for reserves already accounted for in the calculation of a LIBOR Rate pursuant to the
terms hereof).  

(b)          If
the application of any Law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted or arising out of the July, 1988 report of the Basel Committee
on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled  International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
Standards , or the adoption after the date hereof of any other Law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy,
or any change after the date hereof in any of the foregoing, or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any domestic
or foreign Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof,
or compliance by Lender, with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lender s capital
to a level below that which Lender would have achieved but for such application, adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
the policies of Lender with respect to capital adequacy), then, from time to time Borrowers shall pay to Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate Lender for such reduction with respect to any portion of the Loan outstanding.  

(c)          Any
amount payable by Borrowers under  subsection (a)  or  subsection (b)  of this  Section 6.1  shall be paid within
ten (10) days of receipt by Borrowers of a certificate signed by an authorized officer of Agent setting forth the amount due and
the basis for the determination of such amount, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrowers, absent manifest
error. Failure on the part of Agent to demand payment from Borrowers for any such amount attributable to any particular period
shall not constitute a waiver of each Lender s right to demand payment of such amount for any subsequent or prior period.
Agent shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to Borrowers prompt notice of any event described in  subsection (a)  or  (b)
 above, of the amount of the reserve and capital adequacy payments resulting therefrom and the reasons therefor and of the
basis of calculation of such amount;  provided ,  however , that any failure by Agent to so notify Borrowers shall not
affect Borrowers  obligation to pay the reserve and capital adequacy payment resulting therefrom.

6.2.       Borrower
                                         Withholding.    

If
by reason of a change in any applicable Laws occurring after the date hereof, any Borrower is required by Law to make any deduction
or withholding in respect of any taxes (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the net income of any Lender or any franchise
tax imposed on any Lender), duties or other charges from any payment due under the Notes, the sums due from such Borrower in respect
of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding,
Lender receives and retains a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
required to be made.

Borrowers
shall pay all expenses and fees incurred as of the Loan Opening on the Loan Opening Date (unless sooner required herein). At the
time of the Opening of the Loan, Agent may pay from the proceeds of the initial disbursement of the Loan all Loan expenses. Agent
is hereby authorized, without any specific request or direction by Borrowers, to make disbursements from time to time in payment
of or to reimburse Agent for all reasonable Loan expenses and fees.

Any

In

Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (after the expiration of applicable grace periods, except in the event of an emergency

Liens and Contest Thereof . Borrowers will not suffer or permit any mechanics  lien claims to be filed or otherwise asserted
against any Project, and will promptly discharge the same in case of the filing of any claims for lien or proceedings for the
enforcement thereof,  provided ,  however , that Borrowers shall have the right to contest in good faith and with reasonable
diligence the validity of any such lien or claim upon furnishing to the Title Insurer such security or indemnity as it may require
to induce said Title Insurer to issue an endorsement to the Title Policy insuring against all such claims or liens; and provided
further, that the aggregate amount of liens so insured against at any time shall not exceed $25,000.00 for any one Project or
$150,000.00 in the aggregate without Agent s prior written consent.  

(d)           Settlement
of Mechanics  Lien Claims . If Borrowers shall fail promptly either (i) to discharge any such lien, or (ii) to
contest claims asserted and give security or indemnity in the manner provided in  subsection (c)  of this Section, or
having commenced to contest the same, and having given such security or indemnity, shall fail to prosecute such contest with diligence,
or to maintain such indemnity or security so required by the Title Insurer for its full amount, or upon adverse conclusion of
any such contest, to cause any judgment or decree to be satisfied and lien to be released, then and in any such event Agent may,
at its election (but shall not be required to), procure the release and discharge of any such claim and any judgment or decree
thereon and, further, may in its sole discretion effect any settlement or compromise of the same, or may furnish such security
or indemnity to the Title Insurer, and any amounts so expended by Agent or any Lender, including premiums paid or security furnished
in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be deemed to constitute disbursement of the proceeds of the

of such taxes so contested and also of preventing the sale or forfeiture of the Project or any part thereof or any interest therein,
(ii) Borrowers have notified Agent of their intent to contest such taxes, and (iii) Borrowers have deposited security
in form and amount satisfactory to Agent, in its sole discretion. If Borrowers fail to commence such contest or, having commenced
to contest the same, and having deposited such security required by Agent for its full amount, shall thereafter fail to prosecute
such contest in good faith or with due diligence, or, upon adverse conclusion of any such contest, shall fail to pay such tax,
assessment or charge, Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may, at its election (but shall not be required to), pay and discharge
any such tax, assessment or charge, and any interest or penalty thereon, and any amounts so expended by Agent shall be deemed
to constitute disbursements of the Loan proceeds hereunder (even if the total amount of disbursements would exceed the face amount
of the Notes). Borrowers shall furnish to Agent evidence that taxes are paid at least five (5) days prior to the last date for
payment of such taxes and before imposition of any penalty or accrual of interest.

Agent in Agent's name and under its sole dominion and control. All payments deposited in the escrow account, and all interest
accruing thereon, are pledged as additional collateral for the Loan. Notwithstanding Agent's holding of the escrow account, nothing
herein shall obligate Agent or any Lender to pay any insurance premiums or real property taxes with respect to any portion of
the Projects, provided that, so long as no Event of Default exists, Agent shall make available to Borrowers such funds as may
be deposited in the escrow account from time to time for Borrowers' payment of insurance premiums or real property taxes due with
respect to the Projects.

notice and cure periods, upon Lenders  request, Borrowers shall promptly engage oversight management services from a management
company reasonably acceptable to the Lenders. In the event that bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are instituted by or against

(j)           Defaults
Under Leases . Borrowers will not suffer or permit any breach or material default to occur in any of Borrowers  obligations
under any of the Leases nor suffer or permit the same to terminate by reason of any failure of Borrowers to meet any requirement
of any Lease, which default or failure results in a Material Adverse Change, including, without limitation, under any Operating
Lease between any of the Borrowers and any Operator.  

(k)           Agent s
Attorneys  Fees for Enforcement of Agreement . In case of any default or Event of Default hereunder, Borrowers (in addition

of this Agreement; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if at any time or times hereafter Agent or any Lender employs
counsel (whether or not any suit has been or shall be filed and whether or not other legal proceedings have been or shall be instituted)
for advice or other representation with respect to the Projects, this Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, or to protect,
collect, lease, sell, take possession of, or liquidate the Project, or to attempt to enforce any security interest or lien in
any portion of the Project, or to enforce any rights of Agent and each Lender or any of Borrowers  obligations hereunder,
then in any of such events all of the reasonable attorneys  fees arising from such services, and any expenses, costs and
charges relating thereto, shall constitute an additional liability owing by Borrowers to Agent and/or the applicable Lender, on
a joint and several basis, payable on demand.

respective sole cost and expense, if (i) an Event of Default exists, or (ii) if Lender has reasonable grounds to believe that

be. Lender further reserves the right to require such other financial information of Borrowers, Guarantor, and/or the Projects,
at such other times (including monthly or more frequently) as it shall deem necessary. All financial statements must be in the

encumber, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interest (direct or indirect) in such Borrower, attempt

Lenders  rights in connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code
or otherwise result in any Lender being deemed in violation of any applicable provision of ERISA. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify
and hold Agent and each Lender free and harmless from and against all losses, costs (including reasonable attorneys  fees

to Lenders;  

(d)          Exercise
or pursue any other remedy or cause of action permitted under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, or conferred upon Lenders

only and are not to be considered as defining or limiting in any way the scope or intent of the provisions hereof.  

No
modification, waiver, amendment or discharge of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be valid unless the same is in
writing and signed by the party against which the enforcement of such modification, waiver, amendment or discharge is sought.  

EXCEPT
AS SET FORTH IN THE MORTGAGE, ALL OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE

                                         Not to Constitute Waiver of Lenders  Requirements.    

Each
and every covenant and condition for the benefit of the Lenders contained in this Agreement may be waived by the Lenders, provided,
however, that to the extent that the Lenders may have acquiesced in any noncompliance with any construction or nonconstruction
conditions precedent to the Opening of the Loan or to any subsequent disbursement of Loan proceeds, such acquiescence shall not
be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Lenders of such requirements with respect to any future disbursements of Loan proceeds.  

This
Agreement is made for the sole benefit of Borrowers and the Lenders, and no other person or persons shall have any benefits, rights
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, or by reason of any actions taken by Agent or the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement.
Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be liable for any debts or claims accruing in favor of any such parties against any Borrower
or others or against the Project. The Lenders, by making the Loan or taking any action pursuant to any of the Loan Documents,

                                         Invalidity; Severability.    

If
any of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person, party or circumstances, shall, to any extent,
be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such provision or provisions to persons, parties
or circumstances other than those as to whom or which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and
every provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  

16.7.       Definitions
                                         Include Amendments.    

Definitions
contained in this Agreement which identify documents, including, but not limited to, the Loan Documents, shall be deemed to include
all amendments and supplements to such documents from the date hereof, and all future amendments and supplements thereto entered
into from time to time to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement or otherwise with the consent of Agent (and, to the extent
applicable, the Required Lenders). Reference to this Agreement contained in any of the foregoing documents shall be deemed to
include all amendments and supplements to this Agreement.  

This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.  

This
Agreement, taken together with all of the other Loan Documents and all certificates and other documents delivered by Borrowers
to the Lenders, embody the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements, written or oral, relating to the subject matter
hereof.  

In
no event shall Agent or any Lender be liable to any Borrower for punitive, exemplary or consequential damages, including, without
limitation, lost profits, whatever the nature of a breach by Agent or any Lender of its obligations under this Agreement or any
of the Loan Documents, and each Borrower for itself and Guarantor waive all claims for punitive, exemplary or consequential damages.  

Neither
Agent nor any Lender shall not be in default under this Agreement, or under any other Loan Documents, unless a written notice
specifically setting forth the claim of any Borrower shall have been given to Agent within three (3) months after such Borrower
first had knowledge of the occurrence of the event which such Borrower alleges gave rise to such claim and such person does not
remedy or cure the default, if any there be, promptly thereafter. Each Borrower waives any claim, set-off or defense against Agent
or any Lender arising by reason of any alleged default by Agent or any Lender as to which such Borrower does not give such notice
timely as aforesaid. Each Borrower acknowledges that such waiver is or may be essential to the Lenders  ability to enforce
its remedies without delay and that such waiver therefore constitutes a substantial part of the bargain between the Lenders and
Borrowers with regard to the Loan.

withheld, conditioned or delayed (provided that no consent of Borrower shall be required if the Eligible Assignee is also a Lender
as of the date hereof or if an Event of Default then exists) and no consent of the Agent shall be required if the Eligible Assignee
is also a Lender; provided, however, that (i) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent, for its
approval and acceptance, an Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit H attached hereto (the  Assignment
and Assumption ), (ii) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of the assigning Lender s
rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iii) if the potential assignee is not already a Lender hereunder, at least ten (10)
days prior to the date of the assignment, the potential assignee shall deliver to Agent all information reasonably necessary for
Agent to successfully complete the Agent s Patriot Act Customer Identification Process and OFAC Review Process, (iv) unless
the Agent and, so long as no Event of Default exists, Borrowers otherwise consent, the aggregate amount of the Commitment of the
assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment shall in no event be less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000),
(v) the Agent shall receive from the assigning Lender a processing fee of Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500), and (vi)
if the assignment is less than the assigning Lender s entire interest in the Loan, the assigning Lender must retain at least
a Ten Million Dollar ($10,000,000.00) interest in the Loan. The Agent may designate any Eligible Assignee accepting an assignment
of a specified portion of the Loan to be a Co-Agent, an  Arranger  or similar title, but such designation shall not
confer on such Assignee the rights or duties of the Agent. Upon such execution, delivery, approval and acceptance, and upon the
effective date specified in the applicable Assignment and Assumption, (a) the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and Borrowers hereby agree that all
of the rights and remedies of Lenders in connection with the interest so assigned shall be enforceable against Borrowers by an
Eligible Assignee with the same force and effect and to the same extent as the same would have been enforceable but for such assignment,
and (b) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
hereunder and thereunder.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  37     

(b)          By
executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Eligible Assignee thereunder confirm
to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) except as provided in such Assignment and Assumption,
such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties
or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished in connection therewith; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility
with respect to the financial condition of Borrowers or the performance or observance by each Borrower of any of its obligations
under any Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished in connection therewith; (iii) such Eligible Assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement together with such financial statements, Loan Documents and other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into the Assignment and Assumption
and to become a Lender hereunder; (iv) such Eligible Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon Agent, the assigning
Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such Eligible Assignee appoints and authorizes
the Agent to take such action as the Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and
(vi) such Eligible Assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.  

(c)          Agent
shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it and shall record in its records the names
and address of each Lender and the Commitment of, and Percentage of the Loan owing to, such Lender from time to time. Borrowers,
the Agent and Lenders may treat each entity whose name is so recorded as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  

(d)          Upon
receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee, Agent shall, if such Assignment
and Assumption has been properly completed and consented to if required herein, accept such Assignment and Assumption, and record
the information contained therein in its records, and the Agent shall use its best efforts to give prompt notice thereof to Borrowers
(provided that neither the Agent nor the Lenders shall be liable for any failure to give such notice).  

(e)          Borrowers
shall, at no cost or expense to Borrowers, use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Agent and each Lender in connection with the
assignment of interests under this Agreement or the sale of participations herein.  

(f)           Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, and without the need to comply with any of the formal or procedural requirements
of this Agreement, including this Section, any Lender may at any time and from time to time pledge and assign all or any portion
of its rights under all or any of the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall
release such Lender from its obligations hereunder. To facilitate any such pledge or assignment, the Agent shall, at the request
of such Lender, enter into a letter agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank in, or substantially in, the form of the exhibit to
Appendix C to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Operating Circular No. 12.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  38     

(g)          Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any Lender may assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to another branch or Affiliate of such Lender without first obtaining the approval of any Agent or the Borrowers,
provided that (i) such Lender remains liable hereunder unless the Borrowers and Agent shall otherwise agree, (ii) at the time
of such assignment such Lender is not a Defaulting Lender, (iii) such Lender gives the Agent and Borrower at least fifteen (15)
days prior written notice of any such assignment; (iv) the parties to each such assignment execute and deliver to Agent an Assignment
and Assumption, and (v) the Agent receives from the assigning Lender a processing fee of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500).  

(h)          Each
Lender shall have the right, without the consent of the Borrowers, to sell participations to one or more Eligible Assignees in
or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Loan and the Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i) such Lender s
obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation its Commitment to Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii)
such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations (iii) the Borrowers,
the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s
rights and obligations under this Agreement and with regard to any and all payments to be made under this Agreement and (iv) the
holder of any such participation shall not be entitled to voting rights under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (but
such holder may contract with the Lender selling such Eligible Assignee its interest in such Lender s share of the Loan
as to voting of such Lender s interest under  Section 20.6(b)  [but not under any other section of this Agreement],
provided that any such agreement by a Lender shall bind only such Lender alone and not Borrowers, the other Lenders or the Agent).  

(i)           No
Eligible Assignee of any rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be permitted to subassign such rights and obligations.
No participant in any rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be permitted to sell subparticipations of such rights
and obligations.  

(j)           Borrowers
acknowledge and agree that Lenders may provide to any Eligible Assignee or participant originals or copies of this Agreement,
any other Loan Document and any other documents, instruments, certificates, opinions, insurance policies, letters of credit, reports,
requisitions and other materials and information of every nature or description, and may communicate all oral information, at
any time submitted by or on behalf of Borrowers or received by any Lender in connection with the Loan or with respect to Borrowers,
provided that prior to any such delivery or communication, such Eligible Assignees or participants shall agree to preserve the
confidentiality of any of the foregoing to the same extent that such Lender agreed to preserve such confidentiality. In order
to facilitate assignments to Eligible Assignees and sales to Eligible Assignees, Borrowers shall execute such further documents,
instruments or agreements as Lenders may reasonably require; provided, that no Borrower shall be required (i) to execute any document
or agreement which would materially decrease its rights, or materially increase its obligations, relative to those set forth in
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (including financial obligations, personal recourse, representations and warranties
and reporting requirements), or (ii) to expend more than incidental sums of money or incidental administrative time for which
it does not receive reasonable reimbursement in order to comply with any requests or requirements of any Lender in connection
with such assignment or sale arrangement. In addition, Borrowers agrees to cooperate fully with Lenders in the exercise of Lenders 
rights pursuant to this Section, including providing such information and documentation regarding Borrower as any Lender or any
potential Eligible Assignee or participant may reasonably request and to meet with potential Eligible Assignees.  

Anything
in this Agreement contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Lender to Borrowers under this Agreement
are several and not joint and several; each Lender shall only be obligated to fund its Percentage of each disbursement to be made
hereunder up to the amount of its Commitment. During any time, and only during such time, as Agent is the sole Lender and has
not assigned any portion or portions of its interest in the Loan to another Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
Agent in its individual capacity shall be liable for all of the obligations of the Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. From and after the date that Agent as the sole Lender assigns any portion or portions of its interest in the Loan to
another Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, then Agent shall act as the administrative agent on behalf
of itself as a Lender and the other Lenders.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  39     

ARTICLE 20  
  AGENT    

KeyBank
National Association is hereby appointed as Agent hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each Lender hereby irrevocably
authorizes the Agent to act as agent for such Lender and to take such actions as such Lender is obligated or entitled to take
under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Agent agrees to act as such upon the express conditions contained
in this Article in substantially the same manner that it would act in dealing with a loan held for its own account. Agent shall
not have a fiduciary relationship with respect to any Lender by reason of this Agreement.  

The
provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and Borrowers shall not have any rights to
rely on or enforce any of the provisions hereof except as provided in  Section 20.2  below. In performing its functions and
duties under this Agreement, the Agent shall act solely as agent of Lender and does not assume, and shall not be deemed to have
assumed, any obligations toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Borrowers.  

All
acts of and communications by the Agent, as agent for the Lenders, shall be deemed legally conclusive and binding; and Borrower
or any third party (including any court) shall rely on any and all communications or acts of the Agent with respect to the exercise
of any rights or the granting of any consent, waiver or approval on behalf of a Lender in all circumstances where an action by
such Lender is required or permitted pursuant to this Agreement or the provisions of any other Loan Document or by applicable
law without the right or necessity of making any inquiry of any individual Lender as to the authority of Agent with respect to
such matter. In no event shall any of the foregoing limit the rights or obligations of any Lender with respect to any other Lender
pursuant to this  Article 20 .  

The
Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms
of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto or are otherwise necessary or desirable in connection
with the administration of the Loan, and may exercise all other powers of Lenders as are not made subject to the consent of the
Required Lenders pursuant to  Section 20.6(a)  or to the consent of all Lenders pursuant to  Section 20.6(b) .
Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent may consent to or execute easements, plats, dedications, release of minor portions of
the collateral and similar documents. The Agent shall not be considered, or be deemed, a separate agent of the Lenders hereunder,
but is, and shall be deemed, acting in its contractual capacity as Agent, exercising such rights and powers under the Loan Documents
as are specifically delegated to the Agent or Agent is otherwise entitled to take hereunder. Agent shall have no implied duties
to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents
to be taken by the Agent.  

(a)          At
least one (1) Business Day (by 11:00 a.m. Cleveland time) prior to the date the Loan is to be disbursed hereunder pursuant to
this Agreement (or at least two (2) LIBOR Business Days [by 11:00 a.m. Cleveland time] for such disbursement to be made at the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate), the Agent shall notify each Lender of the proposed disbursement. Each Lender shall make available to Agent
(or the funding Lender or entity designated by the Agent), the amount of such Lender s Percentage of such disbursement (with
respect to such Lender, such amount being referred to herein as an   Advance  ) in immediately available funds
not later than 11:00 a.m. (Cleveland time) on the date such disbursement is to be made (such date being referred to herein as
a   Funding Date  ). Unless the Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to such time for funding in
respect of any Advance that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Agent such Lender s Advance, the Agent
may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Agent and the Agent, in its sole discretion, may, but shall
not be obligated to, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available
to the Agent by such Lender on or prior to the respective Funding Date, such Lender agrees to pay and Borrowers agree to repay
to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount
is made available to Borrowers until the date such amount is paid or repaid to Agent, at (A) in the case of such Lender, the Federal
Funds Effective Rate, and (B) in the case of Borrowers, the interest rate applicable at the time to a disbursement made on such
Funding Date. If such Lender shall pay to Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s
Advance, and if both such Lender and Borrowers shall have paid and repaid, respectively, such corresponding amount, Agent shall
promptly return to Borrowers such corresponding amount in same day funds.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  40     

(b)          Requests
by the Agent for funding by the Lenders of disbursements of the Loan will be made by facsimile. Each Lender shall make its Advance
available to the Agent in dollars and in immediately available funds to such Lender and account as the Agent may designate, not
later than Noon (Cleveland time) on the Funding Date. Nothing in this  Section 20.4  shall be deemed to relieve any Lender
of its obligation hereunder to make any Advance on any Funding Date, nor shall any Lender be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to perform its obligations to make any Advance hereunder, and the Commitment of any Lender shall not be increased
or decreased as a result of the failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Advances hereunder.  

20.5.       Distribution
                                         and Apportionment of Payments.    

(a)          Subject
to  Section 20.5(b) , payments actually received by Agent for the account of the Lenders shall be paid to them promptly
after receipt thereof by Agent, but in any event within one (1) Business Day, provided that, if any such payments are not distributed
to the Lenders within one (1) Business Day after Agent s receipt thereof, Agent shall pay to such Lenders interest thereon,
at the lesser of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) if the applicable payment represents repayment of a portion of
the principal of the Loan, the rate of interest applicable to such portion of the Loan, from the date of receipt of such funds
by Agent until such funds are paid in immediately available funds to such Lenders provided such funds are received by Agent not
later than 11:00 A.M. (Cleveland time) on the date of receipt. All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Loan,
all payments of the fees described in this Agreement (but not in any separate fee letter except to the extent expressly set forth
therein), and all payments in respect of any other obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be allocated among such
of Lenders as are entitled thereto, in proportion of their respective Percentages or otherwise as provided herein in the other
Loan Documents, as the case may be. The Agent shall distribute to each Lender at its primary address set forth herein or in its
Assignment and Assumption, or at such other address as a Lender may request in writing, such funds as it may be entitled to receive,
provided that the Agent shall in any event not be bound to inquire into or determine the validity, scope or priority of any interest
or entitlement of any Lender and may suspend all payments and seek appropriate relief (including without limitation instructions
from the Required Lenders, or all Lenders, as applicable, or an action in the nature of interpleader) in the event of any doubt
or dispute as to any apportionment or distribution contemplated hereby. The order of priority herein is set forth solely to determine
the rights and priorities of the Lenders as among themselves and may at any time or from time to time be changed by the Lenders
as they may elect, in writing, without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by Borrowers.  

(b)          If
a Lender (a  Defaulting Lender ) defaults in making any Advance or paying any other sum payable by it hereunder, such
sum together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date such amount was due until repaid (such sum and interest thereon
as aforesaid referred to, collectively, as the  Lender Default Obligation ) shall be payable by the Defaulting Lender
(i) to any Lender(s) which elect, at their sole option (and with no obligation to do so), to fund the amount which the Defaulting
Lender failed to fund or (ii) to Agent or any other Lender which under the terms of this Agreement is entitled to reimbursement
from the Defaulting Lender for the amounts advanced or expended. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, until such
time as a Defaulting Lender has repaid the Lender Default Obligation in full, all amounts which would otherwise be distributed
to the Defaulting Lender shall instead be applied first to repay the Lender Default Obligation (to be applied first to interest
at the Default Rate and then to principal) until the Lender Default Obligation has been repaid in full (whether by such application
or by cure by the Defaulting Lender), whereupon such Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender. Any interest collected from
Borrowers on account of principal advanced by any Lender(s) on behalf of a Defaulting Lender shall be paid to the Lender(s) who
made such advance and shall be credited against the Defaulting Lender s obligation to pay interest on the amount advanced
at the Default Rate. If no other Lender makes an advance a Defaulting Lender failed to fund, a portion of the indebtedness of
Borrowers to the Defaulting Lender equal to the Lender Default Obligation shall be subordinated to the indebtedness of Borrowers
to all other Lenders and shall be paid only after the indebtedness of Borrowers to all other Lenders is paid. The provisions of
this Section shall apply and be effective regardless of whether an Event of Default occurs and is then continuing, and notwithstanding
(i) any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary or (ii) any instruction of Borrowers as to their desired application
of payments. No Defaulting Lender shall have the right to vote on matters which are subject to the consent or approval of Required
Lenders or all Lenders and while any Lender is a Defaulting Lender the requisite percentage of Lenders which constitutes the Required
Lenders shall be calculated exclusive of the Percentage of the Defaulting Lender. The Agent shall be entitled to (i) withhold
or set off, and to apply to the payment of the Lender Default Obligation any amounts to be paid to such Defaulting Lender under
this Agreement, and (ii) bring an action or suit against such Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover
the Lender Default Obligation and, to the extent such recovery would not fully compensate the Lenders for the Defaulting Lender s
breach of this Agreement, to collect damages. In addition, the Defaulting Lender shall indemnify, defend and hold Agent and each
of the other Lenders harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
attorneys  fees and expenses), plus interest thereon at the Default Rate, for funds advanced by Agent or any other Lender
on account of the Defaulting Lender or any other damages such persons may sustain or incur by reason of or as a direct consequence
of the Defaulting Lender s failure or refusal to abide by its obligations under this Agreement.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  41     

(c)          At
least five Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Lender,
each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver
to the Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI, certifying in either
case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Note without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI further undertakes to deliver the
Agent two additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete
or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto
or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement and the Note without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes,
unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which
any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from
duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises the Agent that it is not capable of receiving
payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.  

(a)          Each
of the following shall require the approval or consent of the Required Lenders:  

(i)           The
exercise of any rights and remedies under the Loan Documents following an Event of Default, provided that absent any direction
from the Required Lenders, Agent may exercise any right or remedy under the Loan Documents as Agent may determine in good faith
to be necessary or appropriate to protect the Lenders or the collateral securing the Loan;  

(ii)          Appointment
of a successor Agent;  

(iii)         Approval
of Post-Default Plan (defined in  Section 20.7(d) ); and  

(iv)         Except
as referred to in subsection (b) below, approval of any amendment or modification of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
or issuance of any waiver of any material provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;  

(b)          Each
of the following shall require the approval or consent of all the Lenders:  

(i)           Extension
of the Maturity Date (beyond any extension permitted herein) or forgiveness of all or any portion of the principal amount of the
Loan or any accrued interest thereon, or any other amendment of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents which would reduce
the interest rate options or the rate at which fees are calculated or forgive any loan fee, or extend the time of payment of any
principal, interest or fees;  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  42     

(ii)          Reduction
of the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders;  

(iii)         Increasing
the amount of the Loan or any non-consenting Lender s Commitment;  

(iv)         Release
of any lien on any material collateral (except as Borrowers are entitled to under the Loan Documents); and  

(v)          Amendment
of the provisions of this  Section 20.6 .  

(c)          In
addition to the required consents or approvals referred to in  subsections (a)  and  (b)  above, the Agent may at any
time request instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the terms of this Agreement
or of any of the Loan Documents, the Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant without instructions from any Lenders,
and if such instructions are promptly requested, the Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to
withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever for refraining from taking any action or withholding any
approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have received such instructions from the Required Lenders. Without limiting
the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a result of such Agent acting or refraining
from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders
or, where applicable, all Lenders. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender at any time that the Required Lenders have instructed
the Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.  

(d)          Each
Lender authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into the Loan Documents other than this Agreement for the benefit of the Lenders.
Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Agent at the direction or with the consent of the Required Lenders in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and the exercise by the Agent at the direction or with the consent
of the Required Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all Lenders, except for actions specifically requiring the approval of all Lenders.
All communications from the Agent to the Lenders requesting Lenders  determination, consent, approval or disapproval (i)
shall be given in the form of a written notice to each Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter or item
as to which such determination, approval, consent or disapproval is requested, or shall advise each Lender where such matter or
item may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved, (iii) shall include, if reasonably requested
by a Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials and a summary of all oral information
provided to the Agent by Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved, and (iv) shall include the Agent s recommended
course of action or determination in respect thereof. Each Lender shall reply promptly, but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt of the request therefor from the Agent (the   Lender Reply Period  ). Unless a Lender shall
give written notice to the Agent that it objects to the recommendation or determination of the Agent (together with a written
explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within the Lender Reply Period, such Lender shall be deemed to have approved
of or consented to such recommendation or determination. With respect to decisions requiring the approval of the Required Lenders
or all Lenders, the Agent shall upon receiving the required approval or consent follow the course of action or determination recommended
to the Lenders by the Agent or such other course of action recommended by the Required Lenders.  

20.7.       Agency
                                         Provisions Relating to Collateral.    

(a)          The
Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any Lender,
at any time and from time to time, to take any action with respect to any collateral for the Loan or any Loan Document which may
be necessary to preserve and maintain such collateral or to perfect and maintain perfected the liens upon such collateral granted
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  

(b)          Except
as provided in this Agreement, the Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any other person or entity to
assure that any collateral exists or is owned by any Borrower or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or
that the liens granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or pursuant hereto or thereto have been properly or sufficiently
or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  43     

(c)          Should
the Agent commence any proceeding or in any way seek to enforce the Agent s or the Lenders  rights or remedies under
the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether as a result thereof the Agent shall acquire title to any collateral, each Lender,
upon demand therefor from time to time, shall contribute its share (based on its Percentage) of the reasonable costs and/or expenses
of any such enforcement or acquisition, including, but not limited to, fees of receivers or trustees, court costs, title company
charges, filing and recording fees, appraisers  fees and fees and expenses of attorneys to the extent not otherwise reimbursed
by Borrowers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender shall contribute its share (based on its Percentage)
of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses) if the Agent
employs counsel for advice or other representation (whether or not any suit has been or shall be filed) with respect to any collateral
for the Loan or any part thereof, or any of the Loan Documents, or the attempt to enforce any security interest or lien on any
collateral, or to enforce any rights of the Agent or the Lenders or any of Borrowers  or any other party s obligations
under any of the Loan Documents, but not with respect to any dispute between Agent and any other Lender(s). It is understood and
agreed that in the event the Agent determines it is necessary to engage counsel for Lender from and after the occurrence of a
Default or Event of Default, said counsel shall be selected by the Agent and written notice of such selection, together with a
copy of such counsel s engagement letter and fee estimate, shall be delivered to the Lenders.  

(d)          In
the event that all or any portion of the collateral for the Loan is acquired by the Agent as the result of the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or is retained in satisfaction of all or any part of Borrowers  obligations
under the Loan Documents, title to any such collateral or any portion thereof shall be held in the name of the Agent or a nominee
or subsidiary of Agent, as agent, for the ratable benefit of the Agent and the Lenders. The Agent shall prepare a recommended
course of action for such collateral (the   Post-Default Plan  ), which shall be subject to the approval of the
Required Lenders. The Agent shall administer the collateral in accordance with the Post-Default Plan, and upon demand therefor
from time to time, each Lender will contribute its share (based on its Percentage) of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by the Agent pursuant to the Post-Default Plan, including without limitation, any operating losses and all necessary operating
reserves. To the extent there is net operating income from such collateral, the Agent shall, in accordance with the Post-Default
Plan, determine the amount and timing of distributions to Lenders. All such distributions shall be made to Lenders in accordance
with their respective Percentages. In no event shall the provisions of this subsection or the Post-Default Plan require the Agent
or any Lender to take an action which would cause such Lender to be in violation of any applicable regulatory requirements.  

20.8.       Lender
                                         Actions Against Borrower or the Collateral.    

Each
Lender agrees that it will not take any action, nor institute any actions or proceedings, against any Borrower or any other person
hereunder or under any other Loan Documents with respect to exercising claims against such Borrower or rights in any collateral
without the consent of the Required Lenders. With respect to any action by the Agent to enforce the rights and remedies of the
Agent and Lenders with respect to such Borrower and any collateral in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, each Lender
hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the court in which such action is maintained.  

No
Lender shall be permitted to assign or sell all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Borrower
or any Affiliate of any Borrower.  

Subject
to  Sections 20.4  and  20.5 , Lenders agree among themselves that (i) with respect to all amounts received by them
which are applicable to the payment of the Loan, equitable adjustment will be made so that, in effect, all such amounts will be
shared among them ratably in accordance with their Percentages, whether received by voluntary payment, by the exercise of the
right of set-off or bankers  lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any or all of the Loan Documents
or any collateral and (ii) if any of them shall by voluntary payment or by the exercise of any right of counterclaim, set-off,
bankers  lien or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of the Loan held by it which is greater
than its Percentage of the payments on account of the Loan, the one receiving such excess payment shall purchase, without recourse
or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (which it shall be deemed to have done simultaneously upon the receipt of
such payment) in such obligations owed to the others so that all such recoveries with respect to such obligations shall be applied
ratably in accordance with their Percentages; provided, that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing
party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations
shall be returned to that party to the extent necessary to adjust for such recovery, but without interest except to the extent
the purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection with such recovery. Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing
a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights
of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor
of Borrowers in the amount of such participation.

Neither
Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to Borrowers or any Lender for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, except
for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the absence of gross negligence, the Agent shall not be liable
for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith pursuant to  Section 20.5 , and if any such apportionment
or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due,
but not made, shall be to recover from the recipients of such payments any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined
to have been entitled.  

Neither
Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire
into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any use of the
Loan; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any party to any Loan Document; (iii) the
satisfaction of any condition specified in this Agreement, except receipt of items purporting to be the items required to be delivered
to any Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing
furnished in connection therewith, provided that the foregoing shall not release Agent from liability for its gross negligence
or willful misconduct.  

The
Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document
in accordance with written instructions signed by all the Lenders (or the Required Lenders, if such action may be directed hereunder
by the Required Lenders), and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all
of Lenders. Each Lender, severally to the extent of its Percentage, hereby agrees to indemnify Agent against and hold it harmless
from any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, provided
that the foregoing shall not release Agent from liability for its gross negligence or willful misconduct.  

The
Agent may undertake any of its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents, and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable to Lenders, except as to money or securities received by them or their authorized agents,
for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be
entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its duties hereunder and under
any other Loan Document.  

The
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to legal
matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel may be an employee of Agent, provided that the foregoing
shall not release the Agent from liability for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any such counsel shall be deemed to
be acting on behalf of Lender in assisting the Agent with respect to the Loan, but shall not be precluded from also representing
Agent in any matter in which the interests of Agent and the other Lenders may differ.

20.16.       Agent s
                                         Reimbursement and Indemnification.    

Lenders
agree to reimburse and indemnify Agent ratably (i) for any amounts (excluding principal and interest on the Loan and loan
fees) not reimbursed by Borrowers for which Agent is entitled to reimbursement under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other
expenses incurred by Agent on behalf of Lender, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement
of the Loan Documents, if not paid by Borrowers, (iii) for any expenses incurred by Agent on behalf of Lender which may be necessary
or desirable to preserve and maintain collateral or to perfect and maintain perfected the liens upon the collateral granted pursuant
to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, if not paid by Borrowers, (iv) for any amounts and other expenses incurred by
Agent on behalf of Lender in connection with any default by any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, if not paid
by such Lender, and (v) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated
thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent.  

With
respect to its Commitment, if any, Agent shall have the same rights, powers and obligations hereunder and under any other Loan
Document as any Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not an Agent, and the term  Lender 
or  Lenders  shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include Agent in its individual capacities. Borrowers
and each Lender acknowledge and agree that Agent and/or its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, hold other investments
in, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction or have other relationships, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with Borrowers or any of their affiliates in which Borrowers or such
affiliate are not restricted hereby from engaging with any other person.  

Each
Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial
statements and other information prepared by Borrowers and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges
that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.  

Should
Agent receive any written notice of the occurrence of a default or Event of Default, or should the Agent send Borrowers a notice
of Default or Event of Default, the Agent shall promptly furnish a copy thereof to each Lender.  

(a)          Agent
may resign from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Lenders and Borrowers. Such resignation shall take effect on the date set forth in such notice or as otherwise
provided below. Such resignation by Agent as agent shall not affect its obligations hereunder, if any, as a Lender.  

SECURED LOAN AGREEMENT       Page  46     

(b)          Upon
resignation by the Agent, or any successor Agent, the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent with the written consent
of Borrowers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (provided that no consent of Borrowers shall be
required if an Event of Default then exists). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders (with
the consent of Borrowers as set forth in the preceding sentence), and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30)
days after the retiring Agent s giving notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may appoint a successor Agent with
the consent of Borrower, which shall not unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (provided that no consent of Borrower shall
be required if an Event of Default then exists). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Agent
and the Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
other than its liability, if any, for duties and obligations accrued prior to its retirement. After any retiring Agent s
resignation hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this  Article 20  shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
In the event that Synovus Bank, in its sole discretion, elects to become successor Agent, the consent of Borrowers shall not be
required.  

ARTICLE 21  
  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL    

EACH
BORROWER AND LENDER EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR RELATING THERETO OR ARISING FROM THE LENDING RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS THE SUBJECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

AGREEMENTS  

NOW, THEREFORE, intending
to be legally bound, Guarantor, in consideration of the matters described in the foregoing Recitals, which Recitals are incorporated
herein and made a part hereof, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged,
hereby covenants and agrees with Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees,
participants and assigns as follows: 

GUARANTY AGREEMENT       Page  1      

1.           Guarantor
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Agent for the benefit of the Lenders: 

(a)          the
full and prompt payment of the principal of and interest on the Note when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, and at all times thereafter; 

(b)          the
full and prompt payment of any Enforcement Costs (as hereinafter defined in  Section 10  hereof); 

(c)          any

with the intentional misapplication or conversion of any tenant security deposits, insurance proceeds, condemnation awards, or
any proceeds from the sale of a portion of any Project received by any Borrower and not delivered over to Agent or used to restore
the Project in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement; 

(d)          to
the extent any Project generates sufficient income to pay for the same and subject to any right to contest such matters as provided
in the Loan Documents, any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability or obligation suffered or incurred by the Lenders arising out
or on account of or based upon any fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact by any Borrower or Guarantor in any document
executed or presented to Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loan; 

(e)          any
amount(s) necessary to repair or replace any damage to or destruction of any Project which is the result of willful misconduct
or gross negligence on the part of any Borrower including, without limitation, waste, any act of arson or malicious destruction
by any Borrower; 

(f)          any
loss, damage, cost, expense, liability or obligation suffered or incurred by the Lenders out of or on account of or based upon
the failure to maintain insurance as required by the Loan Documents or the failure to timely pay insurance premiums for any such
required insurance for any Project; 

(g)         any
loss, damage, cost, expense, liability or obligation suffered or incurred by the Lenders out of or on account of or based upon
the failure to timely pay any valid real estate taxes for any Project which could create liens on any portion of any Project which
would be superior to the lien or security title of the applicable Mortgage or the other Loan Documents, to the full extent of the
amount claimed by any such lien claimant, except to the extent such loss results from Lenders  failure to pay any valid real
estate taxes for any Project from funds escrowed pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement; 

GUARANTY AGREEMENT       Page  2      

(h)          the
aggregate amount outstanding under the Loan Documents upon any Borrower (i) making a general assignment for the benefit of
its creditors; (ii) filing a petition, answer or consent seeking, or having entered against it an order for relief (or any
similar remedy) under any provision of Title 11 of the United States Code or any other federal, state or foreign Law relating
to insolvency, bankruptcy, rehabilitation, liquidation or reorganization not dismissed within sixty (60) days, or consent to the
institution of any proceedings thereunder; (iii) convening a meeting of its creditors, or any class thereof, for the purpose
of effecting a moratorium upon or extension or composition of its debts; (iv) admitting in writing that it is generally not
able to pay its debts as they mature; or (v) applying for a consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian,
liquidator or other similar official of all or a portion of its assets; and 

(i)          any
loss, damage, cost, expense, liability or obligation suffered or incurred by the Lenders arising out of, on account of, or in connection
with a distribution by any Borrower of Monthly Excess Cash Flow in violation of the provisions of the Loan Documents. 

All amounts due, debts, liabilities and payment
obligations described in subsections (a)   (i) of this  Section 1  shall be hereinafter collectively referred to
as the   Guaranteed Indebtedness .  

2.           In
the event of any default by Borrowers in the payment of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, after the expiration of any applicable cure
or grace period, Guarantor agrees, on demand by Agent or the holder of any Note, to pay the Guaranteed Indebtedness regardless
of any defense, right of set-off or claims which any Borrower or Guarantor may have against Agent or any Lender or the holder of
any Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Guaranty to the contrary, Agent agrees that Guarantor s
liability solely with respect to the amounts described in subsection (a) of Section 1 of this Guaranty shall be limited to thirty
percent (30%) the Loan Amount and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, Guarantor shall be fully
liable for all other amounts described in subsections (b) through (i) of Section 1 of this Guaranty until the payment in full of
the Guaranteed Indebtedness. 

3.           All
of the remedies set forth herein and/or provided for in any of the Loan Documents or at law or equity shall be equally available
to Agent and the Lenders, and the choice by Agent or the Lenders of one such alternative over another shall not be subject to question
or challenge by Guarantor or any other person, nor shall any such choice be asserted as a defense, setoff, or failure to mitigate
damages in any action, proceeding, or counteraction by Agent to recover or seeking any other remedy under this Guaranty, nor shall
such choice preclude Agent from subsequently electing to exercise a different remedy. The parties have agreed to the alternative
remedies provided herein in part because they recognize that the choice of remedies in the event of a default hereunder will necessarily
be and should properly be a matter of good faith business judgment, which the passage of time and events may or may not prove to
have been the best choice to maximize recovery by Agent and the Lenders at the lowest cost to Borrowers and/or Guarantor. It is
the intention of the parties that such good faith choice by Agent or any Lender be given conclusive effect regardless of such subsequent
developments. 

GUARANTY AGREEMENT       Page  3      

4.           Guarantor
does hereby (a) waive notice of acceptance of this Guaranty by Agent and the Lenders and any and all notices and demands of
every kind which may be required to be given by any statute, rule or law, (b) agree to refrain from asserting, until after
repayment in full of the Loan, any defense, right of set-off or other claim which such Guarantor may have against any Borrower,
(c) waive any defense, right of set-off or other claim which any Borrower or Guarantor may have against any Agent, any Lender,
or the holder of any Note, (d) waive any and all rights such Guarantor may have under any anti-deficiency statute or other similar
protections, (e) waive presentment for payment, demand for payment, notice of nonpayment or dishonor, protest and notice of
protest, diligence in collection and any and all formalities which otherwise might be legally required to charge such Guarantor
with liability, and (f) waive any failure by Agent or any Lender to inform such Guarantor of any facts Agent or any Lender
may now or hereafter know about any Borrower, any Project, the Loan, or the transactions contemplated by the Loan Agreement, it
being understood and agreed that neither Agent nor any Lender has any duty so to inform and that such Guarantor is fully responsible
for being and remaining informed by Borrowers of all circumstances bearing on the risk of nonperformance of any Borrower s
obligations. Credit may be granted or continued from time to time by the Lenders to any Borrower without notice to or authorization
from Guarantor, regardless of the financial or other condition of such Borrower at the time of any such grant or continuation.
Neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with Guarantor its assessment of the financial condition
of such Borrower. Guarantor acknowledges that no representations of any kind whatsoever have been made by Agent or any Lender.
No modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Guaranty shall be binding upon Agent or any Lender except as expressly
set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered by Agent on behalf of the Lenders. 

5.           Guarantor
further agrees that Guarantor s liability as guarantor shall in not be impaired or affected by any renewals or extensions
which may be made from time to time, with or without the knowledge or consent of such Guarantor of the time for payment of interest
or principal under the Notes or by any forbearance or delay in collecting interest or principal under the Notes, or by any waiver
by Agent or any Lender under the Loan Agreement, any Mortgage or any other Loan Documents, or by Agent s or any Lender s
failure or election not to pursue any other remedies it may have against any Borrower or Guarantor, or by any change or modification
in any Note, the Loan Agreement, any Mortgage or any other Loan Document, or by the acceptance by Agent or any Lender of any additional
security or any increase, substitution or change therein, or by the release by Agent or any Lender of any security or any withdrawal
thereof or decrease therein, or by the application of payments received from any source to the payment of any obligation other
than the Guaranteed Indebtedness even though Agent or any Lender might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part
or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, it being the intent hereof that, subject to Agent s and the Lenders  compliance
with the terms of this Guaranty, Guarantor shall remain liable for the payment of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, until the Guaranteed
Indebtedness has been paid in full, notwithstanding any act or thing which might otherwise operate as a legal or equitable discharge
of a surety. Guarantor further understands and agrees that Agent and the Lenders may at any time enter into agreements with Borrowers
to amend and modify the Notes, the Loan Agreement, the Mortgages or other Loan Documents (other than this Guaranty), and may waive
or release any provision or provisions of the Notes, the Loan Agreement, the Mortgages and other Loan Documents (other than this
Guaranty) or any thereof, and, with reference to such instruments, may make and enter into any such agreement or agreements as
Agent, the Lenders and Borrowers may deem proper and desirable, without in any manner impairing or affecting this Guaranty or any
of Agent s or Lenders  rights hereunder or Guarantor s obligations hereunder. 

GUARANTY AGREEMENT       Page  4      

6.           This
is an absolute, present and continuing guaranty of payment and not of collection. Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty may be enforced
by Agent on behalf of the Lenders without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any other security or collateral
given in connection herewith or with the Notes, the Loan Agreement, any Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents through foreclosure
or sale proceedings, as the case may be, under any Mortgage or otherwise, or resorting to any other guaranties, and Guarantor hereby
waives any right to require Agent or any Lender to join any Borrower in any action brought hereunder or to commence any action
against or obtain any judgment against any Borrower or to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right. Guarantor further
agrees that nothing contained herein or otherwise shall prevent Agent on behalf of the Lenders from pursuing concurrently or successively
all rights and remedies available to it at law and/or in equity or under the Notes, the Loan Agreement, any Mortgage or any other
Loan Documents, and the exercise of any of its rights or the completion of any of its remedies shall not constitute a discharge
of Guarantor s obligations hereunder, it being the purpose and intent of such Guarantor that the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever. None of Guarantor s
obligations under this Guaranty or any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed or released in any
manner whatsoever by any impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the liability of any Borrower under the Notes,
the Loan Agreement, any Mortgage or other Loan Documents or by reason of the bankruptcy of any Borrower or by reason of any creditor
or bankruptcy proceeding instituted by or against any Borrower. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated (as
the case may be) if at any time payment of all or any part of any sum payable pursuant to the Notes, the Loan Agreement, any Mortgage
or any other Loan Document is rescinded or otherwise required to be returned by Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
dissolution, liquidation, or reorganization of any Borrower, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor,
custodian or conservator of or trustee or similar officer for, any Borrower or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise,
all as though such payment to Agent or such Lender had not been made, regardless of whether Agent or such Lender contested the
order requiring the return of such payment. In the event of the foreclosure of the Mortgage and of a deficiency, Guarantor hereby
promises and agrees forthwith to pay the amount of such deficiency notwithstanding the fact that recovery of said deficiency against
Borrowers would not be allowed by applicable law; however, the foregoing shall not be deemed to require that Agent on behalf of
the Lenders institute foreclosure proceedings or otherwise resort to or exhaust any other collateral or security prior to or concurrently
with enforcing this Guaranty. 

7.           Guarantor
hereby covenants as follows: 

(a)          Guarantor
shall maintain a Tangible Net Worth (as defined below) of not less than the Two Hundred Million and No/100 Dollars ($200,000,000.00);
and 

(b)          Guarantor
shall maintain a minimum of Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) in Cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined below) and
Marketable Securities (as defined below).

political subdivision of any such state or any public instrumentality thereof maturing within ninety (90) days after the date of

rating services as may be acceptable to Lender) and not listed for possible down-grade in Credit Watch published by Standard  
Poor s; (iii) commercial paper, other than commercial paper issued by any Borrower or any of its affiliates, maturing no
more than ninety (90) days after the date of creation thereof and, at the time of acquisition, having a rating of at least A-1

shall be rating such obligations, then the highest rating from such other nationally recognized rating services as may be acceptable
to Agent); and (iv) domestic and Eurodollar certificates of deposit or time deposits or bankers  acceptances maturing within
ninety (90) days after the date of acquisition thereof, overnight securities repurchase agreements, or reverse repurchase agreements
secured by any of the foregoing types of securities or debt instruments issued, in each case, by (A) any commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or Canada having combined capital
and surplus of not less than Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000) or (B) Agent. 

Marketable Securities  
shall mean securities regularly traded, and currently listed, on a nationally recognized exchange. 

Tangible Net Worth  
means, as of a given date, all amounts that would be included under net assets (the result of total assets on a gross basis, defined
as total assets plus accumulated depreciation, minus total liabilities) on the consolidated statement of net assets of Guarantor
and its consolidated subsidiaries at such date, determined pursuant to sound accounting principles that fairly represent the financial
position of the Guarantor. 

8.           Guarantor
agrees to deliver to Lender on an annual basis within one hundred-twenty (120) days after each December 31, the audited financial
statements of Guarantor along with a covenant compliance certificate in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit A  certified
by an authorized officer of Guarantor. Guarantor agrees that the failure to furnish such financial statements shall constitute
a default subject to the notice and cure provisions set forth in  Section 14.1(a)(ii)  of the Loan Agreement. 

9.           In
the event any Lender or any holder of any Note shall assign any Note to any lender or other entity to secure a loan from such lender
or other entity to any Lender or such holder for an amount not in excess of the amount which will be due, from time to time, from
Borrowers to any Lender under such Note with interest not in excess of the rate of interest which is payable by Borrowers under
such Note, Guarantor will accord full recognition thereto and agree that all rights and remedies of such Lender or such holder
hereunder shall be enforceable against such Guarantor by such lender or other entity with the same force and effect and to the
same extent as would have been enforceable by such lender or such holder but for such assignment; provided, however, that unless
Agent shall otherwise consent in writing, Agent shall have an unimpaired right, prior and superior to that of its assignee or transferee,
to enforce this Guaranty for Lender s benefit to the extent any portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or any interest therein
is not assigned or transferred.

10.         If:
(a) this Guaranty is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or is collected through any legal proceeding; (b) an
attorney is reasonably required and retained to represent Agent or any Lender in any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership,
or other proceedings affecting creditors  rights and involving a claim under this Guaranty; (c) an attorney is retained
to provide advice to Agent or any Lender or other representative of Agent or any other Lender in any proceedings whatsoever in
connection with this Guaranty and Agent or such Lender prevails in such proceedings, then Guarantor shall pay to Agent or such
Lender upon demand all reasonable attorney s fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (all of which are
referred to herein as   Enforcement Costs  ), in addition to all other amounts due hereunder, regardless of whether
all or a portion of such Enforcement Costs are incurred in a single proceeding brought to enforce this Guaranty as well as the
other Loan Documents. 

11.         The
parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this Guaranty comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws
and judicial decisions. However, if any provision or provisions, or if any portion of any provision or provisions, in this Guaranty
is found by a court of law to be in violation of any applicable local, state or federal ordinance, statute, law, administrative
or judicial decision, or public policy, and if such court should declare such portion, provision or provisions of this Guaranty
to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that such portion,
provision or provisions shall be given force to the fullest possible extent that they are legal, valid and enforceable, that the
remainder of this Guaranty shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable portion, provision or
provisions were not contained therein, and that the rights, obligations and interest of Agent and the Lenders under the remainder
of this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect. 

12.          TO
THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE MARSHALLING OF ASSETS BY AGENT. WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY (EACH, A   PROCEEDING  ), AGENT (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE
HEREOF) AND GUARANTOR IRREVOCABLY (A) SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS HAVING JURISDICTION
IN THE CITY OF CLEVELAND AND STATE OF OHIO, AND (B) WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE AT ANY TIME TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
OF ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT, WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT ANY PROCEEDING HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND
FURTHER WAIVES THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING, THAT SUCH COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER SUCH PARTY.
NOTHING IN THIS GUARANTY SHALL PRECLUDE AGENT FROM BRINGING A PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION NOR WILL THE BRINGING OF A PROCEEDING
IN ANY ONE OR MORE JURISDICTIONS PRECLUDE THE BRINGING OF A PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. AGENT AND GUARANTOR FURTHER AGREE
AND CONSENT THAT, IN ADDITION TO ANY METHODS OF SERVICE OF PROCESS PROVIDED FOR UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SERVICE OF PROCESS IN
ANY PROCEEDING IN ANY OHIO STATE OR UNITED STATES COURT SITTING IN THE CITY OF CLEVELAND AND MAY BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED
MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, DIRECTED TO THE APPLICABLE PARTY AT THE ADDRESS INDICATED BELOW, AND SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE COMPLETE
UPON RECEIPT;  EXCEPT  THAT IF SUCH PARTY SHALL REFUSE TO ACCEPT DELIVERY, SERVICE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETE FIVE (5) DAYS
AFTER THE SAME SHALL HAVE BEEN SO MAILED.  

GUARANTY AGREEMENT       Page  7      

13.         Any
indebtedness of any Borrower to Guarantor now or hereafter existing is hereby subordinated to the payment of the Guaranteed Indebtedness.
Guarantor agrees that, until the entire Guaranteed Indebtedness has been paid in full, no Guarantor will seek, accept, or retain
for its own account, any payment from such Borrower on account of such subordinated debt. Any payments to Guarantor on account
of such subordinated debt shall be collected and received by Guarantor in trust for the Lenders and shall be paid over to Agent
for the benefit of the Lenders on account of the Guaranteed Indebtedness without impairing or releasing the obligations of Guarantor
hereunder. 

14.         Any
amounts received by the Lenders from any source on account of the Loan may be utilized by the Lenders for the payment of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness and any other obligations of any Borrower to the Lenders in such order as the Lenders may from time to time elect.
Additionally, if the Guaranteed Indebtedness guaranteed hereby is less than the full indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, all rents,
proceeds and avails of each Project, including proceeds of realization of the Lenders  collateral, shall be deemed applied
on the Guaranteed Indebtedness of Borrowers to the Lenders that is not guaranteed by Guarantor until such unguaranteed indebtedness
of Borrowers to the Lenders has been fully repaid before being applied upon the Guaranteed Indebtedness guaranteed by Guarantor. 

15.          GUARANTOR
AND AGENT (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF) HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND
ANY RIGHT UNDER THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR RELATING THERETO OR ARISING FROM THE LENDING RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS
THE SUBJECT OF THIS GUARANTY AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.  

16.         Any
notice, demand, request or other communication which any party hereto may be required or may desire to give hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given (a) if hand delivered, when delivered; (b) if mailed by United States
Certified Mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested), three Business Days after mailing (c) if by Federal Express or other
reliable overnight courier service, on the next Business Day after delivered to such courier service or (d) if by telecopier on
the day of transmission so long as copy is sent on the same day by overnight courier as set forth below:

or at such other address as the party to be
served with notice may have furnished in writing to the party seeking or desiring to serve notice as a place for the service of
notice. 

17.         In
order to induce the Lenders to make the Loan, Guarantor makes the following representations and warranties to the Agent for the
benefit of the Lender set forth in this Section. Guarantor acknowledges that but for the truth and accuracy of the matters covered
by the following representations and warranties, the Lenders would not have agreed to make the Loan: 

(a)          Guarantor
is duly formed, validly existing, and in good standing in its state of organization and has qualified to do business and is in
good standing in any state in which it is necessary in the conduct of its business; 

(b)          Guarantor
maintains an office at the address set forth for such party in  Section 16 ; 

GUARANTY AGREEMENT       Page  9      

(c)          Any
and all balance sheets, net worth statements, and other financial data with respect to Guarantor which have heretofore been given
to Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of Guarantor fairly and accurately present the financial condition of Guarantor in all material
respects as of the respective dates thereof; 

(d)          The
execution, delivery, and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty does not and will not contravene or conflict with (i) any
material Laws, order, rule, regulation, writ, injunction or decree now in effect of any Government Authority, or court having jurisdiction
over Guarantor, (ii) any contractual restriction binding on or affecting Guarantor or Guarantor s property or assets
which may adversely affect Guarantor s ability to fulfill its obligations under this Guaranty, (iii) the instruments creating
any trust holding title to any assets included in Guarantor s financial statements, or (iv) the organizational documents
of Guarantor; 

(e)          This
Guaranty creates legal, valid, and binding obligations of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms; 

(f)           there
is no action, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Guarantor, threatened or affecting Guarantor, which
may adversely affect Guarantor s ability to fulfill its material obligations under this Guaranty. There are no judgments
or orders for the payment of money rendered against Guarantor for an amount in excess of $100,000 which have been undischarged
for a period of ten (10) or more consecutive days or the enforcement of which is not stayed by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise.
To the best of Guarantor s knowledge, Guarantor is not in default under any agreements which may adversely affect Guarantor s
ability to fulfill its material obligations under this Guaranty; and 

(g)          All
statements set forth in the Recitals are true and correct. 

All of the foregoing representations
and warranties shall be deemed remade on the date of the first disbursement of Loan proceeds, on the date of each advance of Loan
proceeds, and upon any extension of the Loan pursuant to the Loan Agreement. Guarantor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Agent
and each Lender free and harmless from and against all loss, cost, liability, damage, and expense, including reasonable attorney s
fees and costs, which Agent or any Lender may sustain by reason of the inaccuracy or breach of any of the foregoing representations
and warranties as of the date the foregoing representations and warranties are made and are remade. 

18.         Guarantor
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Agent all of the applicable financial statements to be delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Agreement. 

19.         This
Guaranty shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, legal and personal representatives, successors and assigns of Guarantor. 

20.          This
Guaranty shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the
State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such state that would require the application of the laws of
a jurisdiction other than such state.  

GUARANTY AGREEMENT       Page  10      

21.         The
Lenders shall be entitled to honor any request for Loan proceeds made by Borrowers and shall have no obligation to see to the proper
disposition of such advances. Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released or affected by reason of any
improper disposition by Borrowers of such Loan proceeds. 

22.         This
Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
