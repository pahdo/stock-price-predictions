    Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  :   
     
   Nature of Operations:  Consumers Bancorp, Inc. (the Corporation) is a bank holding company headquartered in Minerva, Ohio that provides, through its banking subsidiary, Consumers National Bank (the Bank), a broad array of products and services throughout its   primary market area of Carroll, Columbiana, Stark, Summit, Wayne and contiguous counties in Ohio.   The Bank s business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its primary market area.  
       
   Basis of Presentation : The consolidated financial statements for interim periods are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments), which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The unaudited financial statements are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and do not include all disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Corporation s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The results of operations for the interim period disclosed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year.  
     
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and the Bank. All significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
   Segment Information:  The Corporation is a bank holding company engaged in the business of commercial and retail banking, which accounts for substantially all of the revenues, operating income, and assets. Accordingly, all of its operations are recorded in one segment, banking.  
       
   Reclassifications:  Certain items in prior financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Any reclassifications had no impact on prior year net income or shareholders  equity.  
     
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective:  In June 2016, FASB Issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   This ASU adds a new Topic 326 to the Codification and removes the thresholds that companies apply to measure credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost, such as loans, receivables, and held-to-maturity debt securities. Under current U.S. GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses when it is probable that the loss has been incurred. The revised guidance will remove all current loss recognition thresholds and will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost basis of a financial instrument and the amount of amortized cost that the corporation expects to collect over the instrument s contractual life. ASU 2016-13 also amends the credit loss measurement guidance for available-for-sale debt securities and beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for  public business entities,  as defined, that are SEC filers for fiscal years and for interim periods with those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the guidance is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Corporation s consolidated financial statements.

Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities were as follows:  

The income tax provision applicable to these net realized gains amounted to $35 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $12 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
     
  The amortized cost and fair values of debt securities at September 30, 2016, by expected maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Securities not due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and the pooled trust preferred security are shown separately.

  The following table summarizes the securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:   

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI model. Investment securities are generally evaluated for OTTI under FASB ASC Topic 320,  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities .   
     
  In determining OTTI under the ASC Topic 320 model, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.

 (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
   
  The unrealized losses within the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2016 have not been recognized into income because the decline in fair value is not attributed to credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value of the mortgage-backed securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions and collateralized mortgage obligations is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.     The mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were primarily issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. The Corporation does not own any private label mortgage-backed securities.

As of June 30, 2016, the recorded investment of loans classified as troubled debt restructurings was $3,529 with $43 of specific reserves allocated to these loans.   As of June 30, 2016, the Corporation had committed to lend any additional $207 to customers with outstanding loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings.

   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   
   (Unaudited) (continued)   
     
  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 
  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there were no loan modifications completed that were classified as troubled debt restructurings. There were no charge offs from troubled debt restructurings that were completed during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
     
  There were no loans classified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within 12 months following the modification during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.   
     
   Credit Quality Indicators:   
  The Corporation categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, current economic trends and other relevant information. The Corporation analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes loans with a total outstanding loan relationship greater than $100 and non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans. Management monitors the loans on an ongoing basis for any changes in the borrower s ability to service their debt and affirm the risk ratings for the loans and leases in their respective portfolio on an annual basis. The Corporation uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  
     
   Special Mention.  Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date.  
     
   Substandard.  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  
     
   Doubtful.  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed as not rated are either less than $100 or are included in groups of homogeneous loans. These loans are evaluated based on delinquency status, which are disclosed in the previous table within this footnote. Based on the most recent analysis performed, the recorded investment by risk category of loans by class of loans was as follows:

    Note 4 - Fair Value       
   
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:  
     
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.  
     
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.   
     
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  
     
  Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following:   
     
   Securities available-for-sale:    When available, the fair values of available-for-sale securities are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs). For securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3 inputs).   
     
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:

       Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  
     
  Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include the following:  
      
   Impaired Loans:  At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.   
     
  Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:

Impaired loans, which are generally measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a recorded investment of $1,531, with a valuation allowance of $787 at September 30, 2016. The resulting impact to the provision for loan losses was an increase of $41 being recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the recorded investment of impaired loans was $2,150, with a valuation allowance of $747. The resulting impact to the provision for loan losses was a reduction of $3 being recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

  The following table shows the estimated fair values of financial instruments that are reported at amortized cost in the Corporation s consolidated balance sheets, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:  

The assumptions used to estimate fair value are described as follows:  
     
   Cash and cash equivalents:    The carrying value of cash, deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold were considered to approximate fair value resulting in a Level 1 classification.  
     
   Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions:    Fair value of certificates of deposits in other financial institutions was estimated using current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
     
   Accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings:    The carrying value of accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings were considered to approximate fair value due to their short-term duration resulting in a Level 2 classification.   
  Loans held for sale: The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
     
   Loans:    Fair value for loans was estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. For adjustable rate loans that reprice at least annually and for fixed rate commercial loans with maturities of six months or less which possess normal risk characteristics, carrying value was determined to be fair value. Fair value of other types of loans (including adjustable rate loans which reprice less frequently than annually and fixed rate term loans or loans which possess higher risk characteristics) was estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for similar anticipated maturities resulting in a Level 3 classification. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.  
     
   Securities held-to-maturity:    The held-to-maturity securities are general obligation and revenue bonds made to local municipalities.   The fair values of these securities are estimated using a spread to the applicable municipal fair market curve resulting in a Level 3 classification.   
     
   Time deposits:    Fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit was estimated using the rates offered at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Estimated fair value does not include the benefit that results from low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market resulting in a Level 2 classification.   
     
   Federal Home Loan Bank advances:    Fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances was estimated using current rates at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 for similar financing resulting in a Level 2 classification.   
     
   Federal bank and other restricted stocks, at cost:    Federal bank and other restricted stocks include stock acquired for regulatory purposes, such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock that are accounted for at cost due to restrictions placed on their transferability; and therefore, are not subject to the fair value disclosure requirements.  
     
   Off-balance sheet commitments:    The Corporation s lending commitments have variable interest rates and  escape  clauses if the customer s credit quality deteriorates. Therefore, the fair values of these items are not significant and are not included in the above table.

    Note 5   Earnings Per Share    

Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and is equal to net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares that may be issued upon the vesting of restricted stock awards.  There were no equity instruments that were anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following table details the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
     
   (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)    
     
   General   
  The following is management s analysis of the Corporation s results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016, compared to June 30, 2016. This discussion is designed to provide a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial condition than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report.  
     
   Overview   
  Consumers Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio (the Corporation), owns all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Consumers National Bank, a bank chartered under the laws of the United States of America (the Bank). The Corporation s activities have been limited primarily to holding the common shares of the Bank. The Bank s business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its market area, consisting primarily of Carroll, Columbiana, Stark, Summit, Wayne and contiguous counties in Ohio. The Bank also invests in securities consisting primarily of U.S. government sponsored entities, municipal obligations, mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.    
     
   Results of Operations   
   Three Months Ended September   30  , 2016 and   September 30  , 2015   
     
  In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, net income was $901, or $0.33 per common share, compared to $727, or $0.27 per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The following are key highlights of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016:   

loan loss provision expense in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 totaled $136 compared to $92 in the same prior year period;     

non-interest expenses increased by $149, or 4.7%, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period principally as a result of   higher occupancy and equipment expenses.

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  
  and Results of Operation (continued)  
     
 (Dollars in thousand, except per share data) 
   
  Return on average equity and return on average assets were 8.12% and 0.83%, respectively, for the first three months of fiscal year 2017 compared to 6.90% and 0.70%, respectively, for the same prior year period.  
     
   Net Interest Income    
  Net interest income, the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of the Corporation s earnings. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes, rates and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis (FTE) by total average interest-earning assets. FTE income includes tax-exempt income, restated to a pre-tax equivalent, based on the statutory federal income tax rate. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans are included in average loan balances.  
     
  The Corporation s net interest margin was 3.87% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 3.69% for the same period in 2015.     FTE net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $334, or 9.3%, to $3,908 from $3,574 for the same year ago period.   
     
  FTE interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $347, or 9.1%, from the same year ago period. The Corporation s yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase from 3.93% for the same period last year. Interest income was positively impacted by $191 as the result of the payoff of two loan relationships that were on non-accrual. Excluding the interest income recognized on the non-accrual loans, the yield on average interest-earning assets would have been 3.92% for the current quarter ended September 30, 2016. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $13, or 5.7%, from the same year ago period. The Corporation s cost of funds was 0.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 0.33% for the same year ago period.

   Provision for Loan Losses      
  The provision for loan losses represents the charge to income necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that represents management s assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the Bank s loan portfolio that have been incurred at each balance sheet date. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for loan losses was $136 compared to $92 for the same prior year period. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net charge-offs totaled $18, or an annualized net charge-offs to total loan ratio of 0.03%, compared with $10, or 0.02% of total loans, for the same period last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.41% at September 30, 2016 and 1.39% at June 30, 2016.  
     
  The provision for loan losses for the period ended September 30, 2016 was considered sufficient by management for maintaining an appropriate allowance for probable incurred credit losses.  
     
   Non-Interest Income    
  Non-interest income increased by $113 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same period last year. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, a $103 net gain was recognized from the sale of securities compared with a $35 net gain in the same prior year period.   
     
   Non-Interest Expenses    
  Total non-interest expenses increased to $3,286, or by 4.7%, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared with $3,137 during the same year ago period. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $110, or 32.2%, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same period last year primarily as a result of an increase in building depreciation expense and real estate taxes since the new branch and corporate office facility in Minerva, Ohio was completed during the third fiscal quarter of 2016.   
     
   Income Taxes      
  Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $80, to $252 compared to a year ago. The effective tax rate was 21.9% for the current quarter as compared to 19.1% for the same period last year.  
     
  The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate principally as a result of tax-exempt income from obligations of states and political subdivisions, loans and earnings on bank owned life insurance.   
     
   Financial Condition   
  Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $433,424 compared to $430,390 at June 30, 2016, an increase of $3,034, or an annualized 2.8%.

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  
  and Results of Operations (continued)  
     
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
   
  Total loans increased by $4,209, or an annualized 6.6%, from $256,278 at June 30, 2016 to $260,487 at September 30, 2016. The growth in loans was primarily attributed to the investments in two newer loan production offices in the Stow and Wooster, Ohio markets as well as additions in commercial loan staff. The loan growth was primarily funded by an increase of $6,323, or an annualized 7.3%, in total deposits.   
     
   Non-Performing Assets   
  The following table presents the aggregate amounts of non-performing assets and respective ratios as of the dates indicated.  

Non-accrual loans decreased from June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of receiving full payoff of two loan relationships with a recorded investment of $3.1 million. As of September 30, 2016, impaired loans totaled $3,122, of which $2,354 are included in non-accrual loans. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are classified as impaired if management determines that full collection of principal and interest, in accordance with the terms of the loan documents, is not probable. Impaired loans and non-performing loans have been considered in management s analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Management and the Board of Directors are closely monitoring these loans and believe that the prospects for recovery of principal and interest, less identified specific reserves, are favorable.  
     
   Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
   Liquidity   
  The objective of liquidity management is to ensure adequate cash flows to accommodate the demands of our customers and provide adequate flexibility for the Corporation to take advantage of market opportunities under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress.     Cash is used to fund loans, purchase investments, fund the maturity of liabilities, and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities. The Corporation s principal sources of funds are deposits; amortization and prepayments of loans; maturities, sales and principal receipts from securities; borrowings; and operations.   Management considers the asset position of the Corporation to be sufficiently liquid to meet normal operating needs and conditions. The Corporation s earning assets are mainly comprised of loans and investment securities. Management continually strives to obtain the best mix of loans and investments to both maximize yield and insure the soundness of the portfolio, as well as to provide funding for loan demand as needed.

   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition   
   and Results of Operations (continued)      
     
  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  
   
  Net cash inflow from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $581, net cash outflows from investing activities was $727 and net cash inflows from financing activities was $2,498. A major source of cash was $7,585 from sales, maturities, calls or principal pay downs on available-for-sale securities, a $6,323 increase in deposits and a net increase of $1,417 in short-term borrowings. A major use of cash included the $4,229 purchase of securities and $4,237 increase in loans. Total cash and cash equivalents was $12,533 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $10,181 at June 30, 2016 and $13,648 at September 30, 2015.  
     
  The Bank offers several types of deposit products to its customers. The rates offered by the Bank and the fees charged for them are competitive with others currently available in the market area. Deposits totaled $352,971 at September 30, 2016 compared with $346,648 at June 30, 2016.   
     
  To provide an additional source of liquidity, the Corporation has entered into an agreement with the FHLB of Cincinnati. At September 30, 2016, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati totaled $12,366 as compared with $17,281 at June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional $14,277 from the FHLB of Cincinnati based on a blanket pledge of qualifying first mortgage and multi-family loans.   The Corporation considers the FHLB of Cincinnati to be a reliable source of liquidity funding, secondary to its deposit base.   
     
  Short-term borrowings consisted of repurchase agreements, which is a financing arrangement that matures daily, and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks. The Bank pledges securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Short-term borrowings increased to $20,546 at September 30, 2016 from $19,129 at June 30, 2016.  
     
  Jumbo time deposits (those with balances of $100 and over) totaled $27,174 at September 30, 2016 and $26,879 at June 30, 2016  . These deposits are monitored closely by the Corporation and are mainly priced on an individual basis. When these deposits are from a municipality, certain bank-owned securities are pledged to guarantee the safety of these public fund deposits as required by Ohio law. The Corporation has the option to use a fee-paid broker to obtain deposits from outside its normal service area as an additional source of funding. The Corporation, however, does not rely upon these deposits as a primary source of funding. Although management monitors interest rates on an ongoing basis, a quarterly rate sensitivity report is used to determine the effect of interest rate changes on the financial statements. In the opinion of management, enough assets or liabilities could be repriced over the near term (up to three years) to compensate for such changes. The spread on interest rates, or the difference between the average earning assets and the average interest-bearing liabilities, is monitored quarterly.   
     
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
  In the normal course of business, to meet the financial needs of our customers, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, and involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.   Since commitments to extend credit have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause, some commitments will expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The same credit policies are used in making commitments as are used for on-balance sheet instruments and collateral is required in instances where deemed necessary. Undisbursed balances of loans closed include funds not disbursed but committed for construction projects. Unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed, but committed for, home equity, commercial and consumer lines of credit. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Total unused commitments were $47,703 at September 30, 2016 and $47,728 at June 30, 2016.  
     
   Capital Resources   
  Total shareholders  equity increased to $44,020 as of September 30, 2016 from $43,793 as of June 30, 2016. The increase was the result of $901 in net income during the first quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, which was partially offset by $327 in cash dividends paid and a net reduction of $347 in accumulated other comprehensive income from a decline in unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities.   
     
  The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal regulatory agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective-action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the Corporation s financial statements.

   and Results of Operations (continued)      
     
  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
  
 The Bank s leverage, common equity tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of September 30, 2016 were 9.44%, 13.46% and 14.69%, respectively. This compares to leverage, common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios of 9.25%, 13.37% and 14.58%, respectively, as of June 30, 2016. The Bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized for both periods. Management is not aware of any matters occurring subsequent to September 30, 2016 that would cause the Bank s capital category to change.
     
   Critical Accounting Policies   
  The financial condition and results of operations for the Corporation presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are, to a large degree, dependent upon the Corporation s accounting policies. The selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change  .   
     
  The Corporation has identified the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy and an understanding of this policy is necessary to understand the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Note one (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses), note three (Loans) and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates) of the 2016 Form 10-K provide detail with regard to the Corporation s accounting for the allowance for loan losses. There have been no significant changes in the application of accounting policies since June 30, 2016.

material unforeseen changes in the financial condition or results of Consumers National Bank s customers;     

the economic impact from the oil and gas activity in the region could be less than expected or the timeline for development could be longer than anticipated;     

regional and national economic conditions becoming less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality of assets and the underlying value of collateral could prove to be less valuable than otherwise assumed or debtors being unable to meet their obligations;     

an extended period in which market levels of interest rates remain at historical low levels which could reduce, or put pressure on our ability to maintain, anticipated or actual margins;     

competitive pressures on product pricing and services;      

pricing and liquidity pressures that may result in a rising market rate environment; and     

the nature, extent, and timing of government and regulatory actions.      
     
  The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks the Corporation faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Corporation or that the Corporation currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Corporation. Should any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, those developments could have material adverse effects on the Corporation s business, financial condition and results of operations.

   Item 4   Controls and Procedures   
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
  As of the end of the period covered by the report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15e. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
     
   Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting   
  There have not been any changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Corporation s last quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
