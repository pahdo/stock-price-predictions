ElITE GROUP, INC.  
  F/K/A Elite Books, Inc.  
  Notes To The Unaudited Financial Statements  
  For the Three months ended June 30, 2016  
   
  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS  
   
 Elite Group Inc. (the  Company ) is a corporation, registered in the State of Nevada on May 21, 2013. We are a company at its start up stage. Our business intention was to sell books utilizing the internet, and grow customer base by selling unique editions of books. Currently, we plan to acquire water properties for the oilfield service sector. Management specializes in the acquisition of assets relating to the management of oilfield water used in upstream oil and gas operations. Management's objective is to acquire and consolidate water processing assets in prolific oil and gas exploration areas. Management believes it will accomplish its goal to maximize shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, effective business model design and economies of scale to a fragmented industry. The Company will control the entire process from wellhead to the final destination and use the most environmental friendly practices in all aspects of our operations to protect and conserve the environment for future generations. 
   
 As a result of a private transaction, on January 26, 2016, the control block of stock of this company, represented by 2,000,000 shares of common stock, were cancelled by Vesna Pesic, and 2,020,000 shares of common stock were issued to Terrence Tecco, and a change of control of the Company occurred. 
   
 On July 22, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the  Amended and Restated Articles ) that had the effect of changing the name of the corporation to Elite Group, Inc. and designating 74,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as common stock, par value $0.001 and 1,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as preferred stock, par value $0.001, with the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions designated by the Company s board of directors. 
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Basis of Presentation   
   
 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. 
   
   Accounting Basis   
   
 The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP  accounting). The Company has adopted a calendar year end. 
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
   
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
   
 The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s promissory note obligations approximate fair value, as the terms of these notes are consistent with terms available in the market for instruments with similar risk. 
   
 We account for our derivative financial instruments, consisting solely of certain stock purchase warrants that contain non-standard anti-dilutions provisions and/or cash settlement features, and certain conversion options embedded in our convertible instruments, at fair value using level 3 inputs. We determine the fair value of these derivative liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model when appropriate, and in certain circumstances using binomial lattice models or other accepted valuation practices. 
   
 When determining the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we are required to use various estimates and unobservable inputs, including, among other things, contractual terms of the instruments, expected volatility of our stock price, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. Changes in any of the assumptions related to the unobservable inputs identified above may change the fair value of the instrument. Increases in expected term, anticipated volatility and expected dividends generally result in increases in fair value, while decreases in the unobservable inputs generally result in decreases in fair value. 

6 

Income Taxes   
   
 Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 
   
   Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 Revenue will be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned.  Specifically, revenue will be recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) Service has occurred, customer acceptance has been achieved; (3) Our selling price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) Collection is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenue when services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. 
   
   Stock-Based Compensation   
   
 Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. 
   
   Basic Income (Loss) Per Share   
   
 Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common share equivalents outstanding as of June 30, 2016. 
   
   Comprehensive Income   
   
 The Company has established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Shareholders  Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income. 
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 In February 2016, FASB issued ASU-2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).   The guidance requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right of use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For finance leases: the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income; and repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For operating leases: the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; a single lease cost will be recognized, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis; and all cash payments will be classified within operating activities in the statement of cash flows.   Under Topic 842 the accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The amendments in Topic 842 are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 

7 

In January 2016, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ( FASB ),  issued Accounting  Standards Update ( ASU )  2016-01,   Financial  Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition  and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification  and measurement  of financial instruments.  Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 
   
 In  November  2015,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2015-17,   Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Balance  Sheet  Classification   of  Deferred  Taxes,   which  simplifies  the presentation  of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities  and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this standard will not have any impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 
   
  NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. 
   
 Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
   
 Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of June 30, 2016, the amounts reported for cash, accrued interest and other expenses, notes payables, and derivative liability approximate the fair value because of their short maturities. 
   
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and 

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 

We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at June 30, 2016: 

The following is a reconciliation of the derivative liability for which Level 3 inputs were used in determining the approximate fair value: 

The following tables set forth a description of the financial instruments classified as derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2016 and the assumption used to value the instruments. 
   
  Convertible Debentures  
   
 The derivative liabilities related to the embedded conversion feature were valued using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the following assumptions on the following dates:

  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF   OPERATION  
   
   Business in general   
   
 Elite Group Inc. (the  Company ) was formed in the State of Nevada on May 21, 2013. On January 26, 2016, as a result of a private transaction, whereby 2,000,000 shares of common stock, has been cancelled by the former CEO and 2,020,000 shares of common stock have been issued to Terrence Tecco, a change of control of the Company occurred. 
   
 On July 22, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation that had the effect of changing the name of the corporation to Elite Group, Inc. (previously Elite Books, Inc.) and designating 74,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as common stock, par value $0.001 and 1,000,000 shares of the authorized capital stock of the Company as preferred stock, par value $0.001, with the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions designated by the Company s board of directors. 
    
   General strategy   
   
 The Company plans to acquire water properties for the oilfield service sector. Management specializes in the acquisition of assets relating to the management of oilfield water used in upstream oil and gas operations. Management's objective is to acquire and consolidate water processing assets in prolific oil and gas exploration areas. Management believes it will accomplish its goal to maximize shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, effective business model design and economies of scale to a fragmented industry. The Company will control the entire process from wellhead to the final destination and use the most environmental friendly practices in all aspects of our operations to protect and conserve the environment for future generations. 
   
  CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS  
   
 The Company plans to concentrate its development efforts in the Eagle Ford Formation in South Texas.  We believe such opportunities exist in the United States with the recent improvements in water disposal. We have only recently begun our planned business operations. To date our operations have primarily been devoted to forming the entity and developing our business plan. We have several properties under contract and have completed most of the financing for these acquisitions. 

12 

Results of Operations   
   
 Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 
   
 We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 
   
  Three Month Period Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Month Period Ended June 30, 2015.  
   
 Our net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $489,091compared to a net loss of $2,856, during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our loss was attributable to financing and administrative costs and professional fees incurred compared to nominal business activity in the prior year. 
   
 This change in net loss was primarily the result of the following: 
   
  Revenue  
   
 We recognized $0 of revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $100 of revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease in revenue was attributable to limited resources to maintain revenue. 
   
  Operating expenses  
   
 We incurred operating expenses of $118,294 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $2,956 of operating expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The primary expense in the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $30,000 of salary expense to our Chief Executive Officer in accordance with an employment agreement dated January 26, 2016. Other operating expenses consisted of general and administrative fees of $75,338 in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $2,956 in the three months ended June 30, 2015 related to office, compliance and professional fees.  
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 We incurred interest expense of $45,123 and financing costs of $64,420 related to our convertible debenture in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Additionally, the change in fair value of the Company s derivative instruments amounted to $193,088 and $3,895 of amortization of debt discount during the period. 
   
  Furthermore, the Company into an advisory services agreement with TCA Global Master Fund for investment banking services. The Company shall issue $250,000 in the form of restricted shares of the Company common stock. The issuance of shares are subject to an anti-dilution share issuances to the extent the cash proceeds from the share issuances are inadequate to satisfy the $250,000 fee. The Company issued 139,750 shares of common stock at closing valued at a price equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the average of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock during the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the agreement date. As of June 30, 2016, an additional issuance of 693,613 shares with a fair market value of $208,084 are required to satisfied the advisory agreement whereby an additional financing costs has been recorded to common stock payable.  The Company recorded $64,271 of stock-based financing costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016. 
   
 There was no Other Income (expense) during the three months ended June 30, 2015.  
   
  Net Losses  
   
 Our net loss for the fiscal three months ended June 30, 2016   was $489,091compared to a net loss of $2,856 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to the factors discussed above.    
   
  Weighted average number of shares  
   
 The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 3,014,719 and 2,799,999 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted average number of shares is an average calculation incorporating changes to the shares outstanding within the period reported. 

13 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
 As of June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we had $1,402 and $17 of cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 
   
 We have experienced losses of $489,091and $2,856 for the three months  ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and have an accumulated deficit of $16,313,668 at June 30, 2016. In addition, we have not completed our efforts to establish a stable recurring source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future. There is no assurances that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for our near term requirements or the long-term development and exploration of our leases. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a  going concern . 
   
 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of  convertible debt and/or issuance of common stock.   
   
 Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management's efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern. 
   
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  
   
 We have generated negative cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $70,518 consisting primarily of a net loss of $489,091, offset by the amortization of financing costs of $62,554, non-cash stock compensation of $64,271 and a change in derivative liability of $193,088, an increase of $34,893 in accounts payables and accrued liabilities, an increase of $14,750 of accrued officer salary and an increase of $21,365 in accrued interest payable. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $2,856 consisting of a net loss of $2,856. 
   
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
   
 We neither used nor generated cash from investing activities.   
   
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  
   
 We have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of convertible debt in the three months ended June 30, 2016. We generated cash from financing activities of $70,000 in the issuance of convertible debentures, offset by $7,197 of financing costs, and $9,100 from shareholder loans in the three months ended June 30, 2016. There were no financing activities in the three months ended June 30, 2015.   
   
 PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business 
   
 Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to the acquisition of assets. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

14 

MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' audit report accompanying our March 31, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARANGEMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.  A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s promissory note obligations approximate fair value, as the terms of these notes are consistent with terms available in the market for instruments with similar risk. 
   
 We account for our derivative financial instruments, consisting solely of certain stock purchase warrants that contain non-standard anti-dilutions provisions and/or cash settlement features, and certain conversion options embedded in our convertible instruments, at fair value using level 3 inputs. We determine the fair value of these derivative liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model when appropriate, and in certain circumstances using binomial lattice models or other accepted valuation practices. 
   
 When determining the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we are required to use various estimates and unobservable inputs, including, among other things, contractual terms of the instruments, expected volatility of our stock price, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. Changes in any of the assumptions related to the unobservable inputs identified above may change the fair value of the instrument. Increases in expected term, anticipated volatility and expected dividends generally result in increases in fair value, while decreases in the unobservable inputs generally result in decreases in fair value. 
   
   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   
   
 No report required. 

15 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission  s  rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required  disclosure. 
   
 An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial   reporting. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
   
   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
   
 Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.
