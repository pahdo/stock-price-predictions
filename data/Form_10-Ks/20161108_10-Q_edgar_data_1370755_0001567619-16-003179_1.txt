1. Organization and Nature of Operations

TCP Capital Corp. (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation formed on April 2, 2012 as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). The Company s investment objective is to achieve high total returns through current income and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection. The Company invests primarily in the debt of middle-market companies as well as small businesses, including senior secured loans, junior loans, mezzanine debt and bonds. Such investments may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, the Company may make equity investments directly. The Company was formed through the conversion on April 2, 2012 of the Company s predecessor, Special Value Continuation Fund, LLC, from a limited liability company to a corporation in a non-taxable transaction, leaving the Company as the surviving entity. On April 3, 2012, the Company completed its initial public offering.

Investment operations are conducted in Special Value Continuation Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the  Operating Company ), of which the Company owns 100% of the common limited partner interests, or in one of the Operating Company s wholly owned subsidiaries, TCPC Funding I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( TCPC Funding ) and TCPC SBIC, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the  SBIC ). The Operating Company has also elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The SBIC was organized in June 2013, and, on April 22, 2014, received a license from the United States Small Business Administration (the  SBA ) to operate as a small business investment company under the provisions of Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding and the SBIC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.

The Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, the Company will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. The Operating Company, TCPC Funding, and the SBIC have elected to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The general partner of the Operating Company is SVOF/MM, LLC, which also serves as the administrator of both the Company and the Operating Company (the  Administrator  or the  General Partner ). The managing member of the General Partner is Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC (the  Advisor ), which serves as the investment manager to the Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding, and the SBIC. Most of the equity interests in the General Partner are owned directly or indirectly by the Advisor and its employees.

Company management consists of the Advisor and the Company s board of directors. Operating Company management consists of the General Partner and the Operating Company s board of directors. The Advisor and the General Partner direct and execute the day-to-day operations of the Company and the Operating Company, respectively, subject to oversight from the respective board of directors, which sets the broad policies of the respective entity and performs certain functions required by the 1940 Act in the case of the Operating Company. The board of directors of the Operating Company has delegated investment management of the Operating Company s assets to the Advisor. Each board of directors consists of six persons, four of whom are independent.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The Company is an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies . The Company has consolidated the results of its wholly owned subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 946. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies of the Company and the Operating Company.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities relating to deferred debt issuance costs were reclassified to debt to conform to the current period presentation resulting from the adoption of two Accounting Standards Updates (see  Recent Accounting Pronouncements ).  Certain prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations relating to interest expense, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and commitment fees have been reclassified into  interest and other debt expenses  to conform to the current period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Although management believes these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material.

Investment Valuation

The Company s investments are generally held by the Operating Company, either directly or through either TCPC Funding or the SBIC. Management values investments at fair value in accordance with GAAP, based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies adopted by the board of directors. Fair value is generally defined as the amount for which an investment would be sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

All investments are valued at least quarterly based on quotations or other affirmative pricing from independent third-party sources, with the exception of investments priced directly by the Advisor which in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the capitalization of the Operating Company. Investments listed on a recognized exchange or market quotation system, whether U.S. or foreign, are valued using the closing price on the date of valuation.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Investments not listed on a recognized exchange or market quotation system, but for which reliable market quotations are readily available are valued using prices provided by a nationally recognized pricing service or by using quotations from broker-dealers.

Investments for which market quotations are either not readily available or are determined to be unreliable are priced at fair value using affirmative valuations performed by independent valuation services approved by the board of directors or, for investments aggregating less than 5% of the total capitalization of the Operating Company, using valuations determined directly by the Advisor. Such valuations are determined under a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by the board of directors.

Pursuant to this policy, the Advisor provides recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms as applicable, which firms evaluate such materials along with relevant observable market data to conduct independent appraisals each quarter, and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the Advisor. The audit committee of the board of directors discusses the valuations, and the board of directors approves the fair value of the investments in good faith based on the input of the Advisor, the respective independent valuation firms as applicable, and the audit committee of the board of directors.

Generally, to increase objectivity in valuing the investments, the Advisor will utilize external measures of value, such as public markets or third-party transactions, whenever possible. The Advisor s valuation is not based on long-term work-out value, immediate liquidation value, nor incremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future. The values assigned to investments are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot reasonably be determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated. The foregoing policies apply to all investments, including any in companies and groups of affiliated companies aggregating more than 5% of the Company s assets.

Fair valuations of investments in each asset class are determined using one or more methodologies including the market approach, income approach, or, in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Such information may include observed multiples of earnings and/or revenues at which transactions in securities of comparable companies occur, with appropriate adjustments for differences in company size, operations or other factors affecting comparability.

The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The discount rates used for such analyses reflect market yields for comparable investments, considering such factors as relative credit quality, capital structure, and other factors.

In following these approaches, the types of factors that may be taken into account also include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, comparable costs of capital, the principal market in which the investment trades and enterprise values, among other factors.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in valuing such investments. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized as of the beginning of the reporting period.

At September 30, 2016, the Company s investments were categorized as follows:

* 
 
 For example, quoted prices in inactive markets or quotes for comparable investments

Unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 investments as of September 30, 2016 included the following:

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date, except for private transactions that have conditions to closing, which are recorded on the closing date. The cost of investments purchased is based upon the purchase price plus those professional fees which are specifically identifiable to the investment transaction. Realized gains and losses on investments are recorded based on the specific identification method, which typically allocates the highest cost inventory to the basis of investments sold.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash consists of amounts held in accounts with brokerage firms and the custodian bank. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of generally three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy.

Restricted Investments

The Company may invest without limitation in instruments that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. These instruments generally may be resold to institutional investors in transactions exempt from registration or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these investments may involve time-consuming negotiations and additional expense, and prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult. Information regarding restricted investments is included at the end of the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Restricted investments, including any restricted investments in affiliates, are valued in accordance with the investment valuation policies discussed above.

Foreign Investments

The Company may invest in instruments traded in foreign countries and denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency denominated investments comprised approximately 0.2% and 1.4% of total investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Such positions were converted at the respective closing foreign exchange rates in effect at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and reported in U.S. dollars. Purchases and sales of investments and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies, when they occur, are translated into U.S. dollars based on the foreign exchange rates in effect on the respective dates of such transactions. The portion of gains and losses on foreign investments resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies is included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Investments in foreign companies and securities of foreign governments may involve special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and securities of the U.S. government. These risks include, among other things, revaluation of currencies, less reliable information about issuers, different transaction clearance and settlement practices, and potential future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover, investments in foreign companies and securities of foreign governments and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. government.

Derivatives

In order to mitigate certain currency exchange and interest rate risks, the Operating Company has entered into certain swap and option transactions. All derivatives are reported at their gross amounts as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The transactions entered into are accounted for using the mark-to-market method with the resulting change in fair value recognized in earnings for the current period. Risks may arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in interest rates and the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company was required under the terms of its swap agreement to pledge assets as collateral to secure its obligation. As of September 30, 2016, $0.5 million of cash was held as collateral and was included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a GBP put option with a notional amount of  2.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s interest rate cap with a notional amount of $25.0 million expired and the Company exited its cross currency basis swap with a notional amount of $16.4 million. The put option is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as options.  Gains and losses from derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were included in net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows: 

The Company did not enter into any new derivative transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2015, the Company held an interest rate cap with a notional amount of $25.0 million and a cross currency basis swap with a notional amount of $16.4 million. The interest rate cap and the cross currency basis swap are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as options and unrealized appreciation on swaps, respectively. Gains and losses from derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were included in net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Valuations of derivatives held at September 30, 2016 and 2015 were determined using observable market inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and, accordingly, are classified as Level 2 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

Costs of approximately $4.1 million were incurred in September 2016 in connection with placing the Company s unsecured convertible notes (see Note 4). Costs of approximately $1.8 million were incurred during 2015 in connection with the extension of the Operating Company s credit facility (see Note 4). Costs of approximately $1.9 million were incurred during 2015 in connection with placing and extending TCPC Funding s revolving credit facility (see Note 4). Costs of approximately $0.5 million and $0.4 million were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, in connection with placing the SBA Debentures (see Note 4). These costs were deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the respective instruments. The impact of utilizing the straight-line amortization method versus the effective-interest method is not material to the operations of the Company.

Revenue Recognition

Interest and dividend income, including income paid in kind, is recorded on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment. Other fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar income due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income.

Certain debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as general market factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the effective-interest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in excess of the loan s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income.

Income Taxes

The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all federal income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes is required in the consolidated financial statements. The income or loss of the Operating Company, TCPC Funding and the SBIC is reported in the respective partners  income tax returns. In accordance with ASC Topic 740    Income Taxes , the Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements the effect of a tax position when it is determined that such position is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, to be sustained upon examination. As of September 30, 2016, all tax years of the Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding and the SBIC since January 1, 2012 remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities. No such examinations are currently pending.

Cost and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Operating Company s investments (including derivatives) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . In particular, the new pronouncement changed the manner in which a reporting entity evaluates whether 1) an entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE ), 2) fees paid to decision makers or service providers are variable interests in a VIE, and 3) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties require the reporting entity to consolidate the VIE. The pronouncement also introduced a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities. ASU 2015-02 also eliminated the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

The Company also adopted ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  as well as ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 .  Together, these ASUs required, in most cases, that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount.  Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements, however, may continue to be presented as an asset in the balance sheet. The adoption of these ASUs resulted in the reclassification of certain debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan, convertible notes and SBA Debentures (as defined in Note 4) from deferred debt issuance costs to debt in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $8.0 million and $4.2 million in debt issuance costs, respectively, were included in debt in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition . Under this new pronouncement, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 applies to all entities and, for public entities, is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted, but no earlier than annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The more significant changes to the current GAAP model resulting from ASU 2016-01 include 1) elimination of the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost, 2) requiring public entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and 3) requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Management Fees, Incentive Compensation and Other Expenses

The Company s management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) on a consolidated basis as of the beginning of each quarter and is payable to the Advisor quarterly in arrears.

Incentive compensation is only paid to the extent the total performance of the Company exceeds a cumulative 8% annual return since January 1, 2013 (the  Total Return Hurdle ). Beginning January 1, 2013, the incentive compensation equals 20% of net investment income (reduced by preferred dividends) and 20% of net realized gains (reduced by any net unrealized losses), subject to the Total Return Hurdle. The incentive compensation is payable quarterly in arrears as an allocation and distribution to the General Partner and is calculated as the difference between cumulative incentive compensation earned since January 1, 2013 and cumulative incentive compensation paid since January 1, 2013. A reserve for incentive compensation is accrued based on the amount of additional incentive compensation that would have been distributable to the General Partner assuming a hypothetical liquidation of the Company at net asset value on the balance sheet date. The General Partner s equity interest in the Operating Company is comprised entirely of such reserve amount, if any. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no such reserve was accrued.

Total expenses related to debt include:

Amounts outstanding under the SVCP Facility, the TCPC Funding Facility, the convertible notes and the SBA Debentures are carried at amortized cost in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of September 30, 2016, the estimated fair values of the SVCP Facility, the TCPC Funding Facility and the SBA Debentures approximated their carrying values, and the 2019 Convertible Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes had estimated fair values of $115.2 million and $141.6 million, respectively. The estimated fair values of the SVCP Facility, the TCPC Funding Facility, the convertible notes and the SBA Debentures are determined by discounting projected remaining payments using market interest rates for borrowings of the Company and entities with similar credit risks at the measurement date. At September 30, 2016, the fair values of the SVCP Facility, the TCPC Funding Facility, the convertible notes and the SBA Debentures as prepared for disclosure purposes were deemed to be Level 3 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy.

Convertible Notes

On June 11, 2014, the Company issued $108.0 million of convertible senior unsecured notes that mature on December 15, 2019, unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The 2019 Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company, and rank structurally junior to the SVCP Facility and the TCPC Funding Facility. The Company does not have the right to redeem the 2019 Convertible Notes prior to maturity. The 2019 Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.25%, payable semi-annually. In certain circumstances, the 2019 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock (such combination to be at the Company s election), at an initial conversion rate of 50.9100 shares of common stock per one thousand dollar principal amount, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $19.64 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilutional adjustments. The initial conversion price was approximately 12.5% above the $17.46 per share closing price of the Company s common stock on June 11, 2014. At September 30, 2016, the principal amount of the 2019 Convertible Notes exceeded the value of the conversion rate multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company s common stock. Therefore, no additional shares have been added to the calculation of diluted earnings per common share and weighted average common shares outstanding.

Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2019, holders may convert their 2019 Convertible Notes only under certain circumstances set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2019 Convertible Notes. On or after June 15, 2019 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding December 15, 2019, holders may convert their 2019 Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, at its election, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, subject to the requirements of the indenture.

On August 30, 2016, the Company issued $140.0 million of convertible senior unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2022, unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The 2022 Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company, and rank structurally junior to the SVCP Facility and the TCPC Funding Facility. The Company does not have the right to redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes prior to maturity. The 2022 Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.625%, payable semi-annually. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock (such combination to be at the Company s election), at an initial conversion rate of 54.5019 shares of common stock per one thousand dollar principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $18.35 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilutional adjustments. The initial conversion price was approximately 10.0% above the $16.68 per share closing price of the Company s common stock on August 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes exceeded the value of the conversion rate multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company s common stock. Therefore, no additional shares have been added to the calculation of diluted earnings per common share and weighted average common shares outstanding.

Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2021, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes only under certain circumstances set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes. On or after September 1, 2021 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 1, 2022, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, at its election, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, subject to the requirements of the indenture.

The 2019 Convertible Notes and 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20    Debt with Conversion and Other Options . Upon conversion of any of the 2019 Convertible Notes or the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Company intends to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, has the option to pay the excess amount in cash or shares of the Company s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares), subject to the requirements of the respective indenture. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2022 Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. At the time of issuance the estimated values of the debt and equity components of the 2019 Convertible Notes were approximately 97.7% and 2.3%, respectively. At the time of issuance the estimated values of the debt and equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes were approximately 97.6% and 2.4%, respectively.

The original issue discounts equal to the equity components of the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2022 Convertible Notes were recorded in  paid-in capital in excess of par  in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As a result, the Company records interest expense comprised of both stated interest and amortization of the original issue discounts. At the time of issuance, the equity components of the 2019 Convertible Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes were $2.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the components of the carrying value of the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2022 Convertible Notes were as follows:

As of September 30, 2016, the Operating Company had committed $75.0 million of regulatory capital to the SBIC, all of which had been funded. SBA Debentures are non-recourse and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. Once drawn, the SBIC debentures bear an interim interest rate of LIBOR plus 30 basis points. The rate then becomes fixed at the time of SBA pooling, which occurs twice each year, and is set to the then-current 10-year treasury rate plus a spread and an annual SBA charge.

The CNO Note had a maturity of April 30, 2021 unless previously converted.  The CNO Note was convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 30, 2021, in integral multiples of $1,000,000 principal amount. However, the CNO Note was automatically convertible in its entirety, without any further action by the holder, on the date on which the closing price of the common stock of the Company was at or above the Company s most recent publicly reported net asset value per share of common stock for at least ten trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a 20 consecutive trading day period. The conversion price was the greater of (a) the closing price of the Company s common shares on the conversion date and (b) the then-current net asset value of the Company. On June 7, 2016, the Company issued 2,011,900 shares of its common stock pursuant to the full conversion, at the holder s option, of the $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount (plus accrued interest) of the CNO Note.

In the normal course of business, investment activities involve executions, settlement and financing of various transactions resulting in receivables from, and payables to, brokers, dealers and the custodian. These activities may expose the Company to risk in the event that such parties are unable to fulfill contractual obligations. Management does not anticipate any material losses from counterparties with whom it conducts business. Consistent with standard business practice, the Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding and the SBIC enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications, and are engaged from time to time in   various legal actions. The maximum exposure under these arrangements and activities is unknown. However, management expects the risk of material loss to be remote.

The Consolidated Schedules of Investments include certain revolving loan facilities and other commitments with unfunded balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as follow:

6. Related Party Transactions

The Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding, the SBIC, the Advisor, the General Partner and their members and affiliates may be considered related parties. From time to time, the Operating Company advances payments to third parties on behalf of the Company which are reimbursable through deductions from distributions to the Company. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no such amounts were outstanding. From time to time, the Advisor advances payments to third parties on behalf of the Company and the Operating Company and receives reimbursement from the Company and the Operating Company. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, amounts reimbursable to the Advisor totaled $0.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

Pursuant to administration agreements between the Administrator and each of the Company and the Operating Company (the  Administration Agreements ), the Administrator may be reimbursed for costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to the Company or the Operating Company, as well as costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator or its affiliates relating to any administrative, operating, or other non-investment advisory services provided by the Administrator or its affiliates to the Company or the Operating Company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, expenses allocated pursuant to the Administration Agreements totaled $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

On November 25, 2014, the Company and the Operating Company obtained an exemptive order (the  Exemptive Order ) from the Securities and Exchange Commission permitting the Company and Operating Company to purchase certain investments from affiliated investment companies at fair value. The Exemptive Order exempts the Company and the Operating Company from provisions of Sections 17(a) and 57(a) of the 1940 Act which would otherwise restrict such transfers. All such purchases are subject to the conditions set forth in the Exemptive Order, which among others include certain procedures to verify that each purchase is done at the current fair value of the respective investment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company purchased approximately $0.0 million and $94.5 million, respectively, of investments from affiliates (as defined in the 1940 Act), which were classified as Level 2 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy at the time of the transfer. The selling party has no continuing involvement in the transferred assets. All of the transfers were consummated in accordance with the provisions of the Exemptive Order and were accounted for as a purchase in accordance with ASC 860,  Transfers and Servicing .

On February 24, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan (the  Company Repurchase Plan ) to acquire up to $50.0 million in the aggregate of the Company s common stock at prices at certain thresholds below the Company s net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company Repurchase Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company Repurchase Plan requires an agent selected by the Company to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company s behalf if and when the market price per share is at certain thresholds below the most recently reported net asset value per share. Under the plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made if the price of the Company s common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchased depends on the terms and conditions of the Company Repurchase Plan, the market price of the common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased. The Company Repurchase Plan was re-approved on August 3, 2016, to be in effect through the earlier of two trading days after the Company s third quarter 2016 earnings release unless further extended or terminated by the Company s board of directors, or such time as the approved $50.0 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions. On November 2, 2016, the Company s board of directors re-approved the Company Repurchase Plan, to be in effect through the earlier of two trading days after the Company s fourth quarter 2016 earnings release or such time as the approved $50.0 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.

On November 8, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared a fourth quarter regular dividend of $0.36 per share payable on December 30, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.

Overview

The Holding Company is a Delaware corporation formed on April 2, 2012 and is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Holding Company was formed through the conversion of a pre-existing closed-end investment company.  The Holding Company elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). Our investment objective is to seek to achieve high total returns through current income and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection. We invest primarily in the debt of middle-market companies as well as small businesses, including senior secured loans, junior loans, mezzanine debt and bonds. Such investments may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, we may make equity investments directly. Investment operations are conducted either in Special Value Continuation Partners, LP, a Delaware Limited Partnership (the  Operating Company ), of which the Holding Company owns 100% of the common limited partner interests, or in one of the Operating Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries, TCPC Funding I, LLC ( TCPC Funding ) and TCPC SBIC, LP (the  SBIC ). The Operating Company has also elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The General Partner of the Operating Company is SVOF/MM, LLC ( SVOF/MM ), which also serves as the administrator (the  Administrator ) of the Holding Company and the Operating Company. The managing member of SVOF/MM is Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC (the  Advisor ), which serves as the investment manager to the Holding Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding, and the SBIC. Most of the equity interests in the General Partner are owned directly or indirectly by the Advisor and its employees.  The SBIC was organized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2013. On April 22, 2014, the SBIC received a license from the United States Small Business Administration (the  SBA ) to operate as a small business investment company under the provisions of Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.

The Holding Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, the Holding Company will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. The Operating Company, TCPC Funding, and the SBIC have elected to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Our leverage program is comprised of $116.0 million in available debt under a senior secured revolving credit facility issued by the Operating Company (the  SVCP Revolver ), a $100.5 million term loan issued by the Operating Company (the  Term Loan  and together with the SVCP Revolver, the  SVCP Facility ), $350.0 million in available debt under a senior secured revolving credit facility issued by TCPC Funding (the  TCPC Funding Facility ), $108.0 million in convertible senior unsecured notes issued by the Holding Company maturing in 2019 (the  2019 Convertible Notes ), $140.0 million in convertible senior unsecured notes issued by the Holding Company maturing in 2022 (the  2022 Convertible Notes ) and $75.0 million in committed leverage from the SBA (the  SBA Program  and, together with the SVCP Facility, the TCPC Funding Facility and the convertible notes the  Leverage Program ). Prior to the repurchase and retirement of the remaining preferred interests on September 3, 2015, the Leverage Program also included amounts outstanding under a preferred equity facility issued by the Operating Company (the  Preferred Interests ).

To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we satisfy those requirements.

Investments

Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.

As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in  qualifying assets,  including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies, public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than $250.0 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We are also permitted to make certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. As of September 30, 2016, 86.3% of our total assets were invested in qualifying assets.

Revenues

We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from dividends on our equity interests, capital gains on the disposition of investments, and certain lease, fee, and other income. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, end-of-term or exit fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment related income.

52 

Expenses

Our primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee and, depending on our operating results, incentive compensation, expenses reimbursable under the management agreement, administration fees and the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement. The base management fee and incentive compensation remunerates the Advisor for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. Our administration agreement with SVOF/MM, LLC (the  Administrator ) provides that the Administrator may be reimbursed for costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to us under the administration agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator or its affiliates relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Administrator or its affiliates to us. We also bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions (and the Holding Company s common stockholders indirectly bear all of the costs and expenses of the Holding Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding and the SBIC), which may include those relating to:

our organization;

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments;

costs of future offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any;

the base management fee and any incentive compensation;

dividends and distributions on our preferred shares, if any, and common shares;

administration fees payable under the administration agreement;

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments;

transfer agent and custodial fees;

registration fees;

listing fees;

taxes;

director fees and expenses;

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC;

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs;

our fidelity bond;

directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;

indemnification payments;

direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit and legal costs; and

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us and the Administrator in connection with administering our business, such as the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement, including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs.

53 

The investment management agreement provides that the base management fee be calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base management fee,  total assets  is determined without deduction for any borrowings or other liabilities. The base management fee is calculated based on the value of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter.

Additionally, the investment management agreement and the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement provide that the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to incentive compensation under certain circumstances. According to the terms of such agreements, no incentive compensation was incurred prior to January 1, 2013. Beginning January 1, 2013, the incentive compensation equals the sum of (1) 20% of all ordinary income since January 1, 2013 and (2) 20% of all net realized capital gains (net of any net unrealized capital depreciation) since January 1, 2013, with each component being subject to a total return requirement of 8% of contributed common equity annually. The incentive compensation is payable to the General Partner by the Operating Company pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement. If the Operating Company is terminated or for any other reason incentive compensation is not paid by the Operating Company, it would be paid pursuant to the investment management agreement between us and the Advisor. The determination of incentive compensation is subject to limitations under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act.

Critical accounting policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the financial statements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our financial statements.

Valuation of portfolio investments

We value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies adopted by our board of directors. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset that (i) are independent of us, (ii) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all available information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (iii) are able to transact for the asset, and (iv) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so).

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to represent fair value. We generally obtain market quotations from recognized exchanges, market quotation systems, independent pricing services or one or more broker-dealers or market makers. However, short term debt investments with remaining maturities within 90 days are generally valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available, which is the case for many of our investments, or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, are valued at fair value using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with our documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors, who also approve in good faith the valuation of such securities as of the end of each quarter. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where we believe that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser, or the market for a particular security cause current market quotations to not reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a  forced  sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread.

54 

The valuation process approved by our board of directors with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value is as follows:

The investment professionals of the Advisor provide recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms approved by our board of directors.

Such firms evaluate this information along with relevant observable market data to conduct independent appraisals each quarter, and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the Advisor.

The fair value of smaller investments comprising in the aggregate less than 5% of our total capitalization may be determined by the Advisor in good faith in accordance with our valuation policy without the employment of an independent valuation firm.

The audit committee of the board of directors discusses the valuations, and the board of directors approves the fair value of the investments in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Advisor, the respective independent valuation firms (to the extent applicable) and the audit committee of the board of directors.

Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values.

When valuing all of our investments, we strive to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Our investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in their valuation. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Investments are classified by GAAP into the three broad levels as follows:

Level 1   Investments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

Level 2   Investments valued using other unadjusted observable market inputs, e.g. quoted prices in markets that are not active or quotes for comparable instruments.

Level 3   Investments that are valued using quotes and other observable market data to the extent available, but which also take into consideration one or more unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation taken as a whole.

As of September 30, 2016, none of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 9.1% were categorized as Level 2, 90.7% were Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by independent third party sources, and 0.2% were Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by the Advisor.

Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on the financial statements.

55 

Revenue recognition

Interest and dividend income, including income paid in kind, is recorded on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment. Other fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar income due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income.

Certain of our debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as general market factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the effective-interest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in excess of the loan s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income.

Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation

We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

Results of operations

Investment income

Investment income totaled $38.5 million and $35.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, of which $38.3 million and $33.8 million were attributable to interest and fees on our debt investments, $0.1 million and $0.4 million to lease income, and $0.1 million and $1.3 million to other income, respectively. Included in interest and fees on our debt investments were $3.0 million and $1.0 million of non-recurring income related to prepayments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The increase in investment income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflects an increase in interest income due to the higher non-recurring income related to a higher level of prepayments in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by decreases in other income and lease income.

Investment income totaled $108.7 million and $107.3 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, of which $105.9 million and $102.9 million were attributable to interest and fees on our debt investments, $1.5 million and $1.0 million to lease income and $1.3 million and $3.4 million to other income, respectively. Included in interest and fees on our debt investments were $5.9 million and $6.0 million of non-recurring income related to prepayments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The increase in investment income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects an increase in interest income due to the larger portfolio size and an increase in lease income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a decrease in other income.

Expenses

Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $12.8 million and $11.2 million respectively, comprised of $6.2 million and $4.6 million in interest expense and related fees, $4.8 million and $4.7 million in base management fees, $0.6 million and $0.4 million in legal and other professional fees, $0.4 million and $0.4 million in administrative expenses, and $0.8 million and $1.1 million in other expenses, respectively. The increase in expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflects the increase in interest expense and other costs related to the increase in available and outstanding debt, including the conversion of the Preferred Interests to term debt, as well as the higher average interest rate following the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the increase in LIBOR rates.

Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $37.0 million and $32.8 million, respectively, comprised of $17.6 million and $13.0 million in interest expense and related fees, $14.0 million and $13.7 million in base management fees, $1.8 million and $2.0 million in legal and professional fees, $1.2 million and $1.2 million in administrative expenses, and $2.4 million and $2.9 million in other expenses, respectively. The increase in expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflects the increase in interest expense and other costs related to the increase in available and outstanding debt, including the conversion of the Preferred Interests to term debt, as well as the higher average interest rate following the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the increase in LIBOR rates.

Net investment income

Net investment income was $25.7 million and $24.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in net investment income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflects the increase in investment income, partially offset by the increase in expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Net investment income was $71.7 million and $74.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in net investment income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflects the increase in expenses, partially offset by the increase in investment income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Net realized and unrealized gain or loss

Net realized gains (losses) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(0.7) million and $5.7 million, respectively. The net realized gain during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily comprised of a $5.9 million gain on the disposition of most of our investment in NEXTracker, Inc.

58 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the change in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation was an increase of $0.9 million and a decrease of $7.6 million, respectively. The change in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was comprised primarily of mark-to-market adjustments resulting from narrower market yield spreads during the quarter. The change in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily comprised of a $4.0 million unrealized gain on our investment in KAGY Holding Company, Inc., a $3.6 million reversal of prior period unrealized appreciation on our investment in NEXTracker, Inc., $2.4 million in unrealized depreciation on our loan to CORE Entertainment, Inc., and other mark-to-market adjustments primarily due to increases in market yield spreads.

Net realized losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $4.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The net realized loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due primarily to the taxable reorganization of our investment in Boomerang Tube, LLC. The net realized loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due primarily to the restructure of our loan to Edmentum, in which we received debt and equity in a delevered company, partially offset by the $5.9 million gain on the partial disposition of our NEXTracker investment.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the change in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation was an increase of $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.

Income tax expense, including excise tax

The Holding Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code ( the Code ) and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, the Holding Company must, among other things, timely distribute to its stockholders generally at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes.

Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. Any excise tax expense is recorded at year end as such amounts are known. There was no U.S. federal excise tax recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Gain on repurchase of Series A preferred interests

Gains on the repurchase of Series A preferred interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The gain on repurchase of Series A preferred interests during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to the repurchase of 1,675 Preferred Interests on June 30, 2015 at a price of $31.8 million.

Dividends to preferred equity holders

Dividends on the Preferred Interests for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Dividends on the Preferred Interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  The decrease in dividends on Preferred Interests during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to the repurchase and retirement of all remaining Preferred Interests during 2015.

Incentive compensation

Incentive compensation distributable to the General Partner for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively. Incentive compensation distributable to the General Partner for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $14.3 million and $14.7 million, respectively. Incentive compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was distributable due to our performance exceeding the total return threshold and was calculated by multiplying net investment income, less preferred dividends (if any), by 20%.

Net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations

The net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations was $20.7 million and $17.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The higher net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the higher net investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months September 30, 2015 and the net realized and unrealized gains during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net realized and unrealized losses during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations was $53.4 million and $57.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the lower net investment income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity and capital resources

Since our inception, our liquidity and capital resources have been generated primarily through the initial private placement of common shares of SVCF (the predecessor entity) which were subsequently converted to common stock of the Holding Company, the net proceeds from the initial and secondary public offerings of our common stock, amounts outstanding under our Leverage Program, and cash flows from operations, including investments sales and repayments and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. The primary uses of cash have been investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our equity holders, payments to service our Leverage Program and other general corporate purposes.

On April 18, 2016, the Company issued $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of a 5.25% convertible senior unsecured note due 2021 to CNO Financial Investments Corp. (the  CNO Note ).  On June 7, 2016, the Company issued 2,011,900 shares of its common stock pursuant to the full conversion, at the holder s option, of the $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount (plus accrued interest) of the CNO Note. The CNO Note was converted at a price of $15.02 per share of common stock. No placement agent or underwriting fees were incurred in connection with the issuance or the conversion of the CNO Note.

On October 3, 2014, we entered into an at-the-market equity offering program (the  ATM Program ) with Raymond James   Associates Inc. through which we may offer and sell, by means of at-the-market offerings from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100,000,000.

On February 24, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan (the  Company Repurchase Plan ) to acquire up to $50.0 million in the aggregate of the Company s common stock at prices at certain thresholds below the Company s net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company Repurchase Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company Repurchase Plan requires an agent selected by the Company to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company s behalf if and when the market price per share is at certain thresholds below the most recently reported net asset value per share. Under the plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made if the price of the Company s common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchased depends on the terms and conditions of the Company Repurchase Plan, the market price of the common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased. The Company Repurchase Plan was re-approved on November 2, 2016, to be in effect through the earlier of two trading days after our fourth quarter 2016 earnings release, unless further extended or terminated by our board of directors, or such time as the approved $50.0 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions. The following table summarizes the total shares repurchased and amounts paid by the Company under the Company Repurchase Plan, including broker fees, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

On July 13, 2015, we obtained exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBA Debentures from our 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting the SBIC to borrow up to $150.0 million more than it would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.  At September 30, 2016 the SBIC had a $75.0 million commitment from the SBA, which increased to $150.0 million on October 13, 2016.

Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $38.6 million. Our primary use of cash in operating activities during this period consisted of the settlement of acquisitions of investments (net of dispositions) of $80.4 million, partially offset by net investment income less incentive allocation (net of non-cash income and expenses) of approximately $41.8 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $143.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisting primarily of $140.0 million from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, $35.0 million of net proceeds from the registered direct public offering of our common stock on July 13, 2016, $30.0 million from proceeds from the issuance of the CNO Note (which was subsequently converted to common equity), and $0.2 million of net borrowings reduced by the $54.9 million in regular dividends on common equity, payment of $4.5 million in debt issuance costs, and $1.9 million in common shares repurchases.

At September 30, 2016, we had $140.9 million in cash and cash equivalents.

The SVCP Facility and the TCPC Funding Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets in our portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, and are subject to compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of a minimum shareholders  equity, the maintenance of a ratio of not less than 200% of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness, and restrictions on certain payments and issuance of debt. Unfavorable economic conditions may result in a decrease in the value of our investments, which would affect both the asset coverage ratios and the value of the collateral securing the SVCP Facility and the TCPC Funding Facility, and may therefore impact our ability to borrow under the SVCP Facility and the TCPC Funding Facility. In addition to regulatory restrictions that restrict our ability to raise capital, the Leverage Program contains various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment of debt, thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the Leverage Program.

Unfavorable economic conditions, while potentially creating attractive opportunities for us, may decrease liquidity and raise the cost of capital generally, which could limit our ability to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program on terms as favorable as are currently included therein. If we are unable to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program upon the various dates of maturity, we expect to have sufficient funds to repay the outstanding balances in full from our net investment income and sales of, and repayments of principal from, our portfolio company investments, as well as from anticipated debt and equity capital raises, among other sources. Unfavorable economic conditions may limit our ability to raise capital or the ability of the companies in which we invest to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event, such as a sale, recapitalization or initial public offering. The SVCP Facility, the 2019 Convertible Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes and the TCPC Funding Facility mature in July 2018, December 2019, March 2022 and March 2020, respectively. Any inability to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program could adversely impact our liquidity and ability to find new investments or maintain distributions to our stockholders.

Challenges in the market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the Code and the 1940 Act. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must satisfy, among other requirements, an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least 90% of our ordinary income and short-term capital gains to our stockholders. Because we are required to distribute our income in this manner, and because the illiquidity of many of our investments may make it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments, our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing. While we anticipate being able to continue to satisfy all covenants and repay the outstanding balances under the Leverage Program when due, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so, which could lead to an event of default.

Contractual obligations

In addition to obligations under our Leverage Program, we have entered into several contracts under which we have future commitments. Pursuant to an investment management agreement, the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Payments under the investment management agreement are equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) and an incentive compensation, plus reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by the Advisor. Under our administration agreement, the Administrator provides us with administrative services, facilities and personnel. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations to us, and may include rent and our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs. We are responsible for reimbursing the Advisor for due diligence and negotiation expenses, fees and expenses of custodians, administrators, transfer and distribution agents, counsel and directors, insurance, filings and registrations, proxy expenses, expenses of communications to investors, compliance expenses, interest, taxes, portfolio transaction expenses, costs of responding to regulatory inquiries and reporting to regulatory authorities, costs and expenses of preparing and maintaining our books and records, indemnification, litigation and other extraordinary expenses and such other expenses as are approved by the directors as being reasonably related to our organization, offering, capitalization, operation or administration and any portfolio investments, as applicable. The Advisor is not responsible for any of the foregoing expenses and such services are not investment advisory services under the 1940 Act. Either party may terminate each of the investment management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days  written notice to the other.

Distributions

Our quarterly dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are declared considering our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to stockholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year. We do not have a policy to pay distributions at a specific level and expect to continue to distribute substantially all of our taxable income. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.

We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:

98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year;

98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and

certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.

We may, at our discretion, carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our stockholders. We will accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.

We have adopted an  opt in  dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend or other distribution payable in cash, each stockholder that has not  opted in  to our dividend reinvestment plan will receive such dividends in cash, rather than having their dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock.

We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable RIC tax treatment. In addition, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC and may be subject to an excise tax.

63 

In order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Related Parties

We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:

Each of the Holding Company, the Operating Company, TCPC Funding, and the SBIC has entered into an investment management agreement with the Advisor.

The Administrator provides us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Administrator may be reimbursed by us for expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and the Administrator s administrative staff and providing, at our request and on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.

We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with the Advisor, pursuant to which the Advisor has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  TCP. 

Pursuant to its limited partnership agreement, the general partner of the Operating Company is SVOF/MM, LLC. SVOF/MM, LLC is an affiliate of the Advisor and the general partner or managing member of certain other funds managed by the Advisor.

The Advisor and its affiliates, employees and associates currently do and in the future may manage other funds and accounts. The Advisor and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds or accounts. Accordingly, conflicts may arise regarding the allocation of investments or opportunities among us and those accounts. In general, the Advisor will allocate investment opportunities pro rata among us and the other funds and accounts (assuming the investment satisfies the objectives of each) based on the amount of committed capital each then has available. The allocation of certain investment opportunities in private placements is subject to independent director approval pursuant to the terms of the co-investment exemptive order applicable to us. In certain cases, investment opportunities may be made other than on a pro rata basis. For example, we may desire to retain an asset at the same time that one or more other funds or accounts desire to sell it or we may not have additional capital to invest at a time the other funds or accounts do. If the Advisor is unable to manage our investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective. In addition, the Advisor may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and certain other entities that could impact our investment returns. While our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted under the 1940 Act, we have received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting certain affiliated investments subject to certain conditions. As a result, we may face conflict of interests and investments made pursuant to the exemptive order conditions which could in certain circumstances affect adversely the price paid or received by us or the availability or size of the position purchased or sold by us.

Recent Developments

From October 1, 2016 through November 4, 2016, the Operating Company has invested approximately $82.9 million primarily in five senior secured loans, as well as equity interests in a portfolio of debt assets with a combined effective yield of approximately 10.0%.

On October 13, 2016, the SBIC received an additional $75.0 million commitment from the SBA, increasing its total commitment to $150.0 million.

On November 2, 2016, our board of directors re-approved the Company Repurchase Plan, to be in effect through the earlier of two trading days after our fourth quarter 2016 earnings release or such time as the approved $50.0 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions.

On November 8, 2016, our board of directors declared a fourth quarter regular dividend of $0.36 per share payable on December 30, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.

Item 3:       Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2016, 80.5% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. At September 30, 2016, the percentage of our floating rate debt investments that bore interest based on an interest rate floor was 78.6%. Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor.

Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates.

Based on our September 30, 2016 balance sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net income (excluding the related incentive compensation impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures 

As of the period covered by this report, we, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
