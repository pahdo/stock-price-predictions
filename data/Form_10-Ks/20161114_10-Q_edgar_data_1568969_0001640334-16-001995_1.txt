     Table of Contents          APPYEA, INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER30, 2016 AND 2015    ( UNAUDITED )      1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS      AppYea, Inc. ("AppYea", "the Company", "we" or "us") was incorporated in the State of South Dakota on November 26, 2012, to engage in the acquisition, purchase, maintenance and creation of mobile software applications. The Company is in the development stage with no significant revenues and a limited operating history.     The Company's common stock is traded on the OTC Markets (www.otcmarkets.com) under the symbol "APYP". The first day of trading on the OTC Markets was December 15, 2014.      2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The Company's fiscal year end is June 30. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial reporting and are presented in US dollars. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed financial statements do not include all information and footnote disclosures required for an annual set of financial statements prepared under United States generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of September 30, 2016, and for the interim periods presented herein have been reflected in these unaudited interim condensed financial statements and the notes thereto. Interim results included herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year as a whole. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on September 30, 2016. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.      3. GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY      At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $5,340 and current liabilities of $62,478 and a working capital deficit of $52,471. The Company has generated net losses since inception. The Company anticipates future losses in its business. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.     The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. There is no assurance that this series of events will be satisfactorily completed.      4. FIXED ASSETS      As at September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, the balance of fixed assets represented a vehicle and mobile application software as follows:           Depreciation expense for three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, was $11,093 and $15,615, respectively.                  6       
     Table of Contents          5. CONVERTIBLE LOANS      On March 13, 2015, the Company issued a $10,000 convertible promissory note payable. The unsecured convertible promissory note payable is due upon demand and carries an interest rate of 12% per annum. The note payable is convertible at the option of the holder, at 50% of the lowest traded price for the 60 days preceding conversion as posted on the OTC Markets or on such US National Exchange upon which the Company may be listed. Effective March 13, 2015, the Company evaluated the terms of the conversion features of the convertible debenture in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815 - 40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Stock and determined it is indexed to the Company's common stock and that the conversion features meet the definition of a liability and therefore bifurcated the conversion feature and accounted for it as a separate derivative liability. The Company valued the conversion feature at the issue date (March 13, 2015) at $14,552 using the Black Scholes valuation model. $10,000 of the value assigned to the derivative liability was recognized as a debt discount on the convertible debenture. The debt discount was recorded as a reduction (contra-liability) to the convertible debenture and is being amortized over the life of the convertible debenture. The balance of $4,552 of the value assigned to the derivative liability was expensed on the issue date of the convertible note.     As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the note was $0 and the note had accrued interest of $454.       6. DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES      The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and hedging, and determined that the instrument should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance resulting in there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options.     Fair Value Assumptions Used in Accounting for Derivative Liabilities.     ASC 815 requires we assess the fair market value of derivative liability at the end of each reporting period and recognize any change in the fair market value as other income or expense item.     The Company determined our derivative liabilities to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value as of September 30, 2016. The Black-Scholes model requires six basic data inputs: the exercise or strike price, time to expiration, the risk free interest rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the stock price in the future, and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The fair value of each convertible note is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model.                  7       
     Table of Contents         At September 30, 2016, the estimated fair values of the liabilities measured on a recurring basis are as follows:           The following table summarizes the changes in the derivative liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2016:            The aggregate loss on derivatives during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,178.      7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES       Leases and Long term Contracts      The Company has not entered into any long term leases, contracts or commitments.      Legal      To the best of the Company's knowledge and belief, no legal proceedings are currently pending or threatened.       Rent      As of January 30, 2013, the Company leases office space at $200 per month with three-month terms, which shall be automatically extended for successive three-month periods unless there is the notice to cancel. The lease can be cancelled at any time by either party with 30 days  notice prior to expiration of an applicable term. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $607 and $609, respectively.                    8       
     Table of Contents         8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY       Convertible Preferred Stock      The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock at a par value of $0.0001.     Each convertible preferred share is convertible into 1,500 shares of common stock and has the voting rights of 1,000 shares of common stock.     As at September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, 5,000,000 shares of the Company's convertible preferred stock were issued and outstanding.      Common Stock      The Company is authorized to issue 750,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.0001.     As at September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, 464,667,527 shares of the Company's common stock were issued and outstanding, respectively.      9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      In March 2016, the Company appointed current CEO and approved a base compensation package of $8,000 per month for CEO. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company recorded accrued salary of $56,000 and $32,000.                 9       
     Table of Contents           Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation         Introduction       The following discussion and analysis was prepared to supplement information contained in the accompanying financial statements and is intended to provide certain details regarding the Company s financial condition as of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. It should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto contained in this report as well as the audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016.       Overview       AppYea, Inc. ( AppYea,   we,   our,   us,  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of South Dakota on November 26, 2012. We are engaged in the acquisition, purchase, maintenance and creation of mobile software applications (or  apps ). The Company s current business plans include the marketing of its mobile applications, as well the expansion of its mobile application portfolio through the acquisition of third party developed mobile applications and/or mobile applications development companies. The Company has derived revenue by way of the sale of its developed and acquired mobile applications as well as through advertisement integration. The Company currently uses advertising integration in the free versions of our mobile applications that are downloaded by consumers. The Company plans to continue using advertisement integration in the free versions of its mobile apps. However, at the time of the initial download, or at any time after the initial download of our application, the consumer can choose to pay for the full,  ad-free,  version of the application, at which time the advertisements are removed. We currently have 13 fully developed gaming applications, as well as a group of 14 applications that provide wait times at various amusement parks, and 23 additional source code applications that operate in the following categories: Business, Education, Entertainment, Finance, Lifestyle, Medical, Music, Navigation, News, Travel, Utilities and Wellness. We also have acquired an automobile application and a social media application.     The Company is currently focused on the sale of its fully developed applications to mobile phone users, and finalizing the development of its source code applications.     The Company is currently actively seeking acquisitions of developed mobile applications and/or mobile applications development companies, however, we currently do not have any proposals or arrangements to enter into any acquisition or other business combinations.       Results of Operations        For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015      We generated revenue of $402 and $386 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a larger mobile apps offering than in the corresponding period during the prior year. During our limited history, we have generated nominal revenue and have very little operating history upon which to evaluate our business.     Operating expenses, which consisted of sales and marketing costs, legal and professional fees, general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense, were $42,043 and $899,561, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating expense decreases during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily the result of decreased professional fees.     Other expenses totaled $2,178 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $390,191 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in change in fair value of derivative liabilities and interest expense during the period ended September 30, 2016.            As a result of the foregoing, we incurred losses of $43,819 and $1,289,366 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of September 30, 2016, we had cash or cash equivalents of $5,340.     Net cash used in operating activities was $9,297 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and net cash used in operating activities was $20,502 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred a net loss of $43,819, which was primarily the cause of the increase in our net cash used in operating activities. At September 30, 2016, our operating activities and available capital resources were not sufficient to fund our operations going forward. We believe that we are going to need to obtain additional funding for our activities during the next twelve months to: 1) further fund the development of our source code applications, 2) to fund any potential acquisitions of developed mobile applications and/or mobile applications development companies, and 3) to fund any operating deficits.     Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $70,840 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 we received $81,750 in proceeds from the sale of convertible notes to third parties.     As of September 30, 2016, our total assets were $81,558 and our total liabilities were $62,478. Included in our assets of as of September 30, 2016 was $5,340 of cash, $4,667 in prepaid expenses, and net fixed assets of $71,551. As of June 30, 2016, our total assets were $101,448 and our total liabilities were $38,549.       Plan of Operation and Funding       During the next twelve months, we anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity will consist of any, or all, of the following: 1) proceeds from sales of our common stock, 2) revenue generated from our operations, and 3) additional debt borrowings. While we are presently generating revenue and we anticipate our revenue will continue to increase, we are currently operating at a loss.     On a long-term basis, our ability to ultimately achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully continue to develop our products and our ability to generate revenues.      CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS      This report contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk       Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.              Item 4. Controls and Procedures.         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       The Company s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is communicated to management and the Company s board of directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     Based on this evaluation, it has been concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective since the following material weaknesses exist:                      Since inception our chief executive officer also functions as our chief financial officer. As a result, our officers may not be able to identify errors and irregularities in the financial statements and reports.                          We were unable to maintain full segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function. While this control deficiency did not result in any material adjustments to our financial statements, it could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties.                          Documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete.         To the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, as financial resources become available we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited to, the following:                      Increasing the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures.
