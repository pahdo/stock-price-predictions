 projects,   plans,   believes,   expects,   anticipates,   intends, 
 targeted,   continue,   remain,   will,   should,   may 
and other similar expressions, or the negative or other variations thereof, as well as discussions of strategy that involve risks

differ materially from our projected future results as a result of the risks we face, and actual future events may differ from
anticipated future events because of the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements that have been made regarding such
anticipated events. 

Factors that may cause actual results,
our performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements
include without limitation:

NOTE
1 - NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Nature
of the Business   

Omagine,
Inc. ( Omagine ) is a holding company incorporated in Delaware in October 2004 which operates through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Journey of Light, Inc., a New York corporation ( JOL ) and its 60% owned subsidiary Omagine LLC, a limited
liability company incorporated under the laws of the Sultanate of Oman ( LLC ). Omagine, JOL and LLC are collectively
referred to herein as the  Company . JOL was acquired by Omagine in October 2005. LLC is the Omani real estate development
company organized by Omagine to do business in Oman.  

The
Company is focused on entertainment, hospitality and real-estate development opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa
(the  MENA Region ). On October 2, 2014, LLC signed a Development Agreement with the Government of Oman (the  Government )
for the development of the Omagine Project. On July 2, 2015, a usufruct over one million square meters of beachfront land (the
 Land Rights ) was registered in LLC' s name with the Government. On November 29, 2015, LLC executed a Murabaha
Facility Agreement with Masraf Al Rayan Bank (Qatar) for a $25 million loan to finance the first phase of the Omagine Project
consisting of design, development and initial construction activities. The loan, which is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions
precedent to closing, would bear interest at an annual rate equal to the 12 month LIBOR rate plus 1% and would be payable one
year from the closing date. One condition precedent to closing is that the loan be secured by a $25,000,000 cash deposit in an
LLC account at the Qatari bank. Contingent upon the closing of such loan and/or contingent upon the general contractor advancing
$10 million to LLC upon execution of the construction contract, commencement of these first phase activities is expected to begin
promptly thereafter. (See Note 9    Omagine Project ).  

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
consolidated balance sheet for the Company at the end of the preceding fiscal year has been derived from the audited balance sheet
and notes thereto contained in the Company s amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015
and is presented herein for comparative purposes. All other financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for all periods presented, have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the respective full years.  

Certain
footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) have been omitted in accordance with the published rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.  

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies    

Principles
of Consolidation  - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Omagine, JOL and LLC. LLC is an Omani limited
liability company organized under the laws of the Sultanate of Oman. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Financial
Instruments  - Financial instruments include cash, convertible notes payable and accrued interest, notes payable and accrued
interest, accounts payable, accrued officers  payroll and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The amounts reported
for financial instruments are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values, based on market information available
to management.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at
the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash included approximately $4,500 and
$36,000 respectively in an Oman bank account not covered by FDIC insurance.  

Inventory
   Inventory is stated at cost. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory consists only of the land under
development acquired on July 2, 2015 (which was costed at the fair value of the property at the date of acquisition). The Company s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect an increase of $490,813,363 in inventory resulting
from LLC s July 2, 2015 acquisition of the Land Rights. (See: Note 2    Inventory and Property ).  

Property,
Plant and Equipment  - Property, plant and equipment ( PP E ) are stated at cost. PP E consists of land
under development which is held for investment; furniture and fixtures; and office machinery and equipment. PP E (including
buildings and structures after they are completed and put into service) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their respective
useful service lives. The Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect an increase
of $227,800,637 in PP E resulting from LLC s July 2, 2015 acquisition of the Land Rights. (See: Note 2    Inventory
and Property ).  

Stockholders 
Equity  - Stockholders  equity consists of common stock, capital in excess of par value, deficit, and non-controlling
interests in LLC. The Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect an increase
of $718,614,000 in stockholders  equity resulting from LLC s July 2, 2015 acquisition of the Land Rights (a $431,168,400
increase in Omagine stockholders  equity and a $287,445,600 increase in non-controlling interests in LLC). (See: Note 2
   Inventory and Property ).  

Estimates
and Uncertainties  - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States ( US GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results as determined at a later date could differ
from those estimates. In recording $718,614,000 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2015 as the value of the non-cash consideration received by LLC as Land Rights, management relied to a great extent upon the
written opinions of three expert valuation firms engaged by LLC to value such Land Rights. Furthermore, in allocating such Land
Value to inventory and land under development, management relied to a great extent upon the written opinion of an expert independent
accounting firm engaged by LLC to advise it on the proper accounting to record the Land Value in LLC s financial statements.
Both LLC s independent auditor and the Company s independent auditor are in agreement with and have consented to the
accounting indicated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. (See: Note 2
   Inventory and Property ).  

Revenue
Recognition  - The Company follows the guidelines of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements  (SAB101). LLC signed a development agreement for the Omagine Project with the Government of Oman in October
2014, and will recognize revenue ratably over the development period of the Omagine Project measured by methods appropriate to
the services or products provided.  

Income
Taxes  - Omagine and JOL are subject to United States ( U.S. ) income taxes at both the federal and state level
and LLC is subject to income taxes in Oman. Separate state income tax returns are filed with each state in the U.S. in which Omagine
or any subsidiary of Omagine is incorporated or qualified as a foreign corporation. LLC files an income tax return in Oman. Other
than with respect to LLC, the Company is not presently subject to income taxes in any foreign country. The Company reports interest
and penalties as income tax expense. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the book
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted income tax rates. The Company establishes a provision for U.S.
income taxes by applying the provisions of the applicable enacted tax laws to taxable income, if any, for the relevant period.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  

Stock-based
Compensation  - Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ). For stock options granted, Omagine has recognized
compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For such stock
option awards, Omagine has recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the requisite service
period. ASC 718 requires that stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Stock
option expense for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $405 and $3,114,190, respectively. (See Note
7).  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share  - Basic earnings (loss) per share of Omagine s $0.001 par value common stock ( Common Stock )
is based upon the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock ( Common Shares ) outstanding during the relevant
period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is based upon the weighted-average number of Common Shares and dilutive securities (stock
options, warrants, stock appreciation rights and convertible notes) outstanding during the relevant period. Dilutive securities
having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings (loss) per share are excluded from the calculation.  

For
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Common Shares underlying the following dilutive securities were
excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive:  

Non-controlling
Interests in Omagine LLC  - As of the date of this report LLC is owned 60% by Omagine. In May 2011, Omagine, JOL and three
new investors (the  New Investors ) entered into a shareholders  agreement (the  Shareholder Agreement )
pursuant to which Omagine s 100% ownership of LLC was reduced to 60%.  

The
New Investors are:  

i.  
      The Office of Royal Court Affairs ( RCA ), an Omani organization, and   

ii.  
      Two subsidiaries of Consolidated Contractors International Company, SAL ( CCIC ). CCIC is a 60 year old Lebanese multi-national company headquartered in Athens, Greece having approximately five and one-half (5.5) billion dollars in annual revenue, one hundred thirty thousand (130,000) employees worldwide, and operating subsidiaries in among other places, every country in the Middle East. The two CCIC subsidiaries which are LLC shareholders are:    

1.  
      Consolidated Contracting Company S.A. ( CCC-Panama ), a wholly owned subsidiary of CCIC and is its investment arm, and    

2.    
      Consolidated Contractors (Oman) Company LLC, CCIC s operating subsidiary in Oman which is a construction company with approximately 13,000 employees.   

As
of the date hereof, the shareholders of LLC and their associated ownership percentages as registered with the Government of Oman
are as follows:  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

On
August 27, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on
determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard
requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements
are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial
doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.  The FASB believes that requiring management to perform
the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with IFRS (which
emphasize management's responsibility for performing the going concern assessment). However, the time horizon for the assessment
(look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under U.S. GAAP and IFRS will continue to differ. This ASU 2014-15 is effective
for annual periods ending after December 16, 2016, and interim periods thereafter; early adoption is permitted. The Company
does not believe that this pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.  

Certain
other accounting pronouncements have been issued by the FASB and other standard setting organizations which are not yet effective
and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Company. The impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations
from adoption of these standards is not expected to be material.  

NOTE
2   INVENTORY AND PROPERTY     

The
Company s consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect $718,614,000 of land under
development which the Company has allocated to inventory ($490,813,363) and property ($227,800,637). This $718,614,000 of land
under development was purchased by LLC on July 2, 2015 pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement whereby an LLC shareholder
agreed to transfer the Land Rights over one million square meters of beachfront land to LLC in exchange for the issuance to such
shareholder of 663,750 Omagine LLC shares (the  LLC Shares ). Since the Land Rights represented a non-cash payment
for the LLC Shares, it was necessary to value the Land Rights.  

Three
expert real estate valuation companies were engaged by LLC to independently value the Land Rights in accordance with the professional
standards specified by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( RICS ) and International Financial Reporting
Standards ( IFRS ). The average of the three Land Rights valuations was 276,666,667 Omani Rials ($718,614,000).  

LLC
engaged the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ( PwC ) as its IFRS accounting consultant to definitively determine
the correct method of recording the $718,614,000 average value of its Land Rights in its IFRS compliant financial statements.
After receiving PwC s written opinion, LLC then consulted with its independent auditor, Deloitte   Touche (M.E.)  
Co. LLC ( Deloitte ) with respect to the matter and received Deloitte s written opinion agreeing with the PwC
opinion. Both PwC and Deloitte independently concluded that the Land Rights should be recorded as capital, work-in-process (inventory)
and land on LLC s financial statements. With respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company s
independent auditor in the U.S. has likewise concurred that, pursuant to US GAAP, the Land Rights should also be recorded as capital,
inventory and land.  

In
determining the allocations to inventory and to land, LLC followed the advice of Deloitte by computing the percentage (x) calculated
by dividing (y) the area of the land LLC definitively knew it intended to sell, by (z) the total area of land constituting the
Omagine Site, and then multiplying that percentage (x) by $718,614,000 to get the correct number (N) for inventory. The correct
number for land was then calculated by subtracting N from $718,614,000. Using its detailed internal financial model, management
calculated (x) to be equal to 68.3%, thereby making the inventory number $490,813,363 and the land number $227,800,637. In its
consolidated financial statements therefore, the Company has divided the Land Rights between land under development which is held
for sale (inventory) and land under development which is held for investment (PP E). These percentage allocations may be modified
over time as the more precise land uses become apparent during and after the master planning and construction processes.  

As
more fully described in Note 1 and in Note 9 (See:  the Omagine LLC Shareholder Agreement section of Note 9), financing
for the Omagine Project has not yet been secured. If such financing is not obtained, LLC may not be able to complete the Omagine
Project and may not be able to recover the $718,614,000 value of the land under development described above.

Options/Stock Appreciation Rights    

Omagine s
shareholders approved the reservation by Omagine of 2,500,000 Common Shares for issuance under the 2003 Omagine, Inc. Stock Option
Plan (the  2003 Plan ). The 2003 Plan expired on August 31, 2013. On March 6, 2014, the Board of Directors approved
the adoption of the 2014 Omagine, Inc. Stock Option Plan (the  2014 Plan ).  

Both
the 2003 Plan and the 2014 Plan are designed to attract, retain and motivate employees, directors, consultants and other professional
advisors of Omagine and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Recipients ) by giving such Recipients the opportunity
to acquire stock ownership in Omagine through the issuance of stock options ( Stock Options ) to purchase Common Shares.  

Omagine
has registered for resale the 2.5 million Common Shares reserved for issuance under the 2003 Plan by filing a registration statement
with the SEC on Form S-8. At September 30, 2016, there were 2,279,000 unexpired Stock Options issued but unexercised under the
2003 Plan and all such Stock Options remain valid until the earlier of their exercise date or expiration date.  

Pursuant
to the 2014 Plan, 3,000,000 Common Shares were reserved for issuance. The 2014 Plan was amended to increase the reservation of
3,000,000 Common Shares for issuance to 5,000,000 Common Shares and to permit issuance of stock appreciation rights ( The
Amended 2014 Plan ). Omagine intends to seek its shareholders  ratification of the adoption by Omagine of the Amended
2014 Plan. At September 30, 2016, there were 990,000 unexpired Stock Options and 1,455,000 Stock Appreciation Rights ( SARs )
issued but unexercised under the Amended 2014 Plan.

Tempest Warrants at an exercise price of $1.40 per Common Share for proceeds of $336,000. On October 2, 2014, a further 250,000
Tempest Warrants were exercised by such affiliate at an exercise price of $1.31 per Common Share for proceeds of $327,500. On
June 29, 2015, the investor exercised 158,228 of the Tempest Warrants at an exercise price of $1.58 per Common Share for proceeds
of $250,000. In conjunction with this June 29, 2015 exercise, Omagine agreed with the investor to file a registration statement
with the SEC to register all the aforementioned Common Shares presently owned by the investor and his affiliate as well as the
remaining 351,772 Common Shares underlying the remaining 351,772 Tempest Warrants outstanding at that time. On October 8, 2015,
2,375 Tempest Warrants were transferred to an affiliate, a  Non-U.S. Affiliate . On October 8, 2015, such Non-U.S.
Affiliate exercised such 2,375 Tempest Warrants at an exercise price of $1.28 per Common Share for proceeds to Omagine of $3,040.
The balance of all 349,397 unexercised Tempest Warrants expired on June 23, 2016.  

The
Strategic Warrants    

Omagine
has 6,422,124 Warrants outstanding, 3,211,062 of which are exercisable for the purchase of one Common Share at a per Common Share
exercise price of $5.00 and 3,211,062 of which are exercisable for the purchase of one Common Share at a per Common Share exercise
price of $10.00 (collectively, the  Strategic Warrants ).  

Omagine
filed a post-effective amendment to its registration statement on Form S-1 (Commission File No. 333-183852) whereby the Strategic
Warrants and the 6,422,124 Common Shares underlying the Strategic Warrants were registered by Omagine (the  Warrant Registration ).
The Warrant Registration was declared effective by the SEC and its effective status expired. Omagine filed another post-effective
amendment to the Warrant Registration on February 11, 2015 which was declared effective by the SEC on February 13, 2015 and its
effective status expired. Omagine filed another post-effective amendment to the Warrant Registration on January 14, 2016 which
was declared effective by the SEC on January 25, 2016 (the  Updated Warrant Registration ). As of the date hereof,
the effective status of the Updated Warrant Registration expired and the Company intends to file a post-effective amendment to
such Registration Statement with the SEC in order to again register the Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Strategic
Warrants. Neither the exercise prices of the Strategic Warrants nor the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Strategic Warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, combination or subdivision of the Common Stock, or
a dividend, reclassification, reorganization, or spinoff.  

On
August 18, 2014, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, the expiration date for all Strategic Warrants was extended
for a third time to June 30, 2015 and again on January 5, 2015, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, the expiration
date for all Strategic Warrants was extended to December 31, 2015. Again on August 12, 2015, pursuant to a resolution of the Board
of Directors, the expiration date for all Strategic Warrants was extended to December 31, 2016. All other terms and conditions
of the Strategic Warrants remained the same. All Strategic Warrants expire on December 31, 2016 unless redeemed earlier by Omagine
upon 30 days prior written notice to the Strategic Warrant holders.

Equity
Financing Agreements    

Omagine,
Inc. and YA were parties to a Stand-By Equity Distribution Agreement (the  2011 SEDA ) which was due to expire on
September 1, 2014. On July 21, 2014, the 2011 SEDA was terminated by the mutual consent of Omagine and YA.  

On
April 22, 2014, Omagine and YA entered into a new Standby Equity Distribution Agreement on generally the same terms and conditions
as the 2011 SEDA (the 2014 SEDA ). Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the 2014 SEDA was to terminate
automatically on the earlier of (i) the first day of the month next following the 24-month anniversary of the  Effective
Date  (as hereinafter defined) (i.e. February 1, 2017), or (ii) the date on which YA shall have made payment to Omagine
of Advances pursuant to the 2014 SEDA in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000. On September 20, 2016, the Company and YA entered
into an agreement amending the SEDA extending the term of the 2014 SEDA to February 1, 2019 or to such date on which YA shall
have made payment to Omagine of Advances pursuant to the 2014 SEDA in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (the  Second SEDA
Amendment ). On April 22, 2014, in satisfaction of a $150,000 commitment fee due pursuant to the 2014 SEDA, Omagine issued
85,822 restricted Common Shares to YA Global II SPV, LLC, which is an affiliate of YA (the  Affiliate ). On September
21, 2016 in satisfaction of a $150,000 commitment fee due pursuant to the Second SEDA Amendment, Omagine issued 161,290 restricted
Common shares to the YA Affiliate. (See Note 6)  

Pursuant
to the terms of the 2014 SEDA, Omagine may in its sole discretion, and upon giving written notice to YA (an  Advance Notice ),
periodically sell Common Shares to YA ( Shares ) at a per Share price ( Purchase Price ) equal to 95%
of the lowest daily volume weighted average price (the  VWAP ) for a Common Share as quoted by Bloomberg, L.P. during
the five (5) consecutive Trading Days (as such term is defined in the 2014 SEDA) immediately subsequent to the date of the relevant
Advance Notice (the  Pricing Period ).  

Omagine
is not obligated to sell any Shares to YA but may, over the term of the 2014 SEDA and in its sole discretion, sell to YA that
number of Shares valued at the Purchase Price from time to time in effect that equals up to five million dollars ($5,000,000)
in the aggregate. YA is obligated under the 2014 SEDA to purchase such Shares from Omagine subject to certain conditions including
(i) Omagine filing a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale by YA of the Shares sold to YA under the 2014
SEDA ( Registration Statement ), (ii) the SEC declaring such Registration Statement effective (the date of such declaration
by the SEC being the  Effective Date ), (iii) Omagine certifying to YA at the time of each Advance Notice that Omagine
has performed all covenants and agreements to be performed and has complied with all obligations and conditions contained in the
2014 SEDA, (iv) periodic sales of Shares to YA must be separated by a time period of at least five Trading Days, and (v) the dollar
value of any individual periodic sale of Shares designated by Omagine in any Advance Notice may not exceed the greater of (a)
two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), or (b) the average of the  Daily Value Traded  for each of the five (5) Trading
Days immediately preceding the date of the relevant Advance Notice, where Daily Value Traded is the product obtained by multiplying
the number representing the daily trading volume of Common Shares for such Trading Day by the VWAP for a Common Share on such
Trading Day.  

Omagine
Project    

The
Omagine Project is planned to be developed on one million square meters (equal to approximately 245 acres) of beachfront land
facing the Gulf of Oman just west of the capital city of Muscat and nearby Muscat International Airport (the  Omagine Site ).
LLC has signed a Development Agreement ( DA ) and a Usufruct Agreement ( UA ) for the Omagine Project
with the Government of Oman. (See  Development Agreement and Usufruct Agreement  below). The Omagine Project is planned
to be an integration of cultural, heritage, entertainment and residential components including a high-culture theme park and associated
buildings, shopping and retail establishments, restaurants and approximately 2,100 residences.  

Development
Agreement and Usufruct Agreement   

Omagine s
60% owned subsidiary, LLC, signed a DA with the Government of Oman in October 2014 for the development in Oman by LLC of the Omagine
Project. The legal effectiveness of the DA was conditional upon its ratification by Oman s Ministry of Finance, which Ratification
occurred in March 2015. On July 1, 2015 (the  Operative Date ), the Government and LLC entered into the UA with respect
to the land constituting the Omagine Site.  

The
Land Rights give LLC extensive rights over the land constituting the Omagine Site including the right to sell such land on a freehold
basis. On July 2, 2015, the UA was registered by the Government and a Land Rights registration fee of 20,250 Omani Rials ($52,650)
was paid by LLC to the Government (and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September
30, 2015), which registration legally perfected LLC s ownership of the Land Rights.  

The
five year period commencing on the Operative Date is a rent free period and thereafter LLC will pay annual rent to the Government
based on only the built but unsold commercial area of the Omagine Project (approximately 150,000 square meters) or approximately
45,000 Omani Rials ($117,000) per year based on the current annual per square meter fee of 0.300 Omani Rials ($0.78). The term
of the DA is 20 years and the term of the UA is 50 years (renewable) commencing from the Operative Date. The UA and the DA provisions
relevant to the UA survive the expiration of the term of the DA.  

The
Operative Date of July 1, 2015 is the date from which all time periods for the execution by LLC of various tasks enumerated in
the DA are to be measured. The continued legal effectiveness of the DA subsequent to the Operative Date is dependent upon the
following milestone dates being achieved (any or all of which may be extended or waived by the Government): (1) LLC s delivery
to the Government within twelve months from the Operative Date of a term sheet with lenders for the financing of the first phase,
any other phase or all of the Project, (2) LLC s submission to the Ministry of Tourism of a social impact assessment within
8 months of the Operative Date and the Government s approval thereof within 12 months of the Operative Date, (3) the Government s
approval within 12 months of the Operative Date of the development control plan for the Omagine Project, and (4) the transformation
of LLC into a joint stock company within 12 months of the Operative Date. Company management has had informal discussions with
the concerned government officials and management is confident that given the present economic conditions in the region (of which
the Government is keenly aware), the Company will be granted an extension of time on many of such due dates similar to the extension
of the Operative Date to July 1. 2015 already previously granted by the Government.  

Pursuant
to the DA, LLC must substantially complete the construction of the seven Pearl buildings and one hotel (the  Minimum Build
Obligation  or  MBO ) within 5 years of the Operative Date. Any material breach by LLC of its obligation to
perform the MBO would constitute an event of default under the DA. The DA specifies that the principal construction contracts
should be executed within one year of the Operative Date. LLC is required to provide written notice to the Government in certain
circumstances, such as LLC s change in an anticipated milestone date that would result in a substantial achievement of work
to occur later than 60 days after such milestone date. The DA provides that the Government is required to grant reasonable requests
for the extension of the terms of the DA in such circumstances.  

The
foregoing discussion of the terms of the DA and UA is not meant to be definitive or complete and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the complete texts of the DA and UA as filed by the Company with the SEC.  

Omagine
LLC Shareholder Agreement   

Omagine
and JOL organized LLC in Oman and capitalized it with an initial investment of twenty thousand (20,000) Omani Rials ($52,000).
On April 20, 2011, Omagine, JOL and the New Investors entered into a shareholder agreement relating to LLC (the  Shareholder
Agreement ).  

Pursuant
to the Shareholder Agreement, Omagine invested an additional 70,000 Omani Rials ($182,000) into LLC and agreed to make a further
additional investment into LLC of 210,000 Omani Rials ($546,000) after the execution of the DA (the  OMAG Final Equity Investment ).
As of December 31, 2015, Omagine had invested 300,000 Omani Rials ($780,000) into LLC. Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement,
RCA invested the value of the Land Rights as a non-cash  payment-in-kind  capital contribution to LLC on July 2, 2015.  

Further
pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, the New Investors invested an aggregate of 60,000 Omani Rials ($156,000) into LLC and agreed,
subject to certain conditions precedent, to make further additional investments into LLC in the aggregate amount of 26,628,125
Omani Rials ($69,233,125).  

The
CCC Deferred Investment Obligation and the OMAG Option    

The
conditions precedent to CCC and RCA being required to make their agreed $69,233,125 aggregate additional investments (their  Deferred
Equity Investments ) into LLC include (1) the execution of a construction contract on or before July 1, 2016 between LLC
and CCC-Oman (the  CCC-Contract ) and (2) execution of a legally binding agreement between LLC and a lender pursuant
to which such lender agrees to provide Debt Financing for the first phase or any or all phases of the Omagine Project in an amount
sufficient to finance the first phase of the Omagine Project s construction plus the installment payments due to Omagine
for its Success Fee and Pre-Development Expense Amount.(the  First Financing Agreement Date ).  

The
First Financing Agreement Date occurred on November 29, 2015 but the CCC-Contract was not executed on or before July 1, 2016 nor
has it been executed yet as of the date hereof and the LLC Shareholders are presently re-negotiating portions of the Shareholder
Agreement (an  Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement ).  

The
failure to execute the CCC-Contract by July 1, 2016 does not relieve RCA of its continuing obligation under the Shareholder Agreement
(irrespective of such CCC-Contract failure) to make RCA s approximately $20 million Deferred Investment into LLC; but it
may (under certain conditions) relieve CCC of its obligation under the Shareholder Agreement to make its approximately $49 million
Deferred Investment into LLC.  

Additionally
pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, such failure of the CCC-Contract to occur on or before July 1, 2016 automatically and without
any further action required by any party, triggered and activated on July 2, 2016 an option in favor of Omagine, Inc. (the  OMAG
Option ) to purchase all LLC Shares presently owned by CCC at any time of OMAG s choosing prior to July 1, 2017 at
a price equal to CCC s original purchase price of 22,500 Omani Rials ($58,500). Furthermore pursuant to the Shareholder
Agreement, neither CCC-Oman nor CCC-Panama is permitted to sell any of such LLC Shares presently owned by them prior to July 2,
2017 to any Person other than Omagine, Inc., or to a purchaser designated by Omagine, Inc., in a sale made pursuant to the exercise
of the OMAG Option.  

Although
the LLC Shareholders are presently negotiating an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement, there is no assurance that it will
happen. If agreement is not reached by the LLC Shareholders on the matters presently under discussion, or if alternative financing
is not obtained, or if alternative shareholder arrangements are not agreed, LLC may not be able to complete the Omagine Project
and may not be able to recover the $718,614,000 value of the Land Rights included in the Company s Consolidated Balance
Sheet at September 30, 2016 (See Note 2).  

Further
pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, LLC is required to pay Omagine a Success Fee of $10,000,000 in five equal annual installments
beginning on or within 10 days after the Draw Date and a Pre-Development Expense Amount to be determined (presently estimated
at $17,920,114) payable 50% on or within 10 days after the Draw Date and 50% in five equal annual installments beginning on the
first anniversary of the Draw Date. The Draw Date is defined as  the date upon which LLC draws and receives the first amount
of Debt Financing pursuant to a Financing Agreement . It is possible that the payment terms for the Pre-Development Expense
Amount and the Success Fee may be modified if and only if the LLC Shareholders agree to an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement.

Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Omagine, Inc. ( Omagine 
or the  Registrant ) was incorporated in Delaware in October 2004 and is a holding company which conducts substantially
all its operations through its 60% owned subsidiary Omagine LLC, an Omani limited liability corporation ( LLC ) and
its wholly-owned subsidiary Journey of Light, Inc., a New York corporation ( JOL ). Omagine and JOL are collectively
referred to herein as  OMAG  and Omagine, JOL and LLC are collectively referred to herein as the  Company . 

The Company is focused on entertainment,
hospitality and real estate development opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa (the  MENA Region ) and on
the design and development of distinctive tourism destinations. The Company presently concentrates the majority of its efforts
on the business of LLC and specifically on the Omagine Project. Omagine, Inc. has 20,132,048 shares of its Common Stock issued
and outstanding as of November 14, 2016. 

In November 2009, Omagine organized
LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary under the laws of the Sultanate of Oman ( Oman ) to design, develop, own and operate
our initial project   a mixed-use tourism and real estate project named the  Omagine Project  (See  The
Omagine Project  below). In October 2014, LLC and the Government of Oman (the  Government ) signed an agreement
(the  Development Agreement  or  DA ) for the development in Oman by LLC of the Omagine Project (See: Exhibits
10.7 and 99.1 and  The Development Agreement and the Usufruct Agreement , below). On July 2, 2015, after the Usufruct
Agreement ( UA ) was registered by the Government legally perfecting LLC s ownership of the Land Rights, the
Government and LLC entered into an agreement (the  Operative Agreement ) making July 1, 2015 the  Operative Date 
from which all time periods for the execution by LLC of various tasks enumerated in the DA are to be measured. 

Omagine initially capitalized LLC at
Omani Rials ( OR ) 20,000 [$52,000] and in 2011 Omagine s 100% ownership of LLC was reduced to 60% pursuant to
a shareholders  agreement (the  Shareholder Agreement ) signed in May 2011 by Omagine, JOL and three new LLC
minority investors (See: Exhibit 10.6 and  The Shareholder Agreement  below). 

As of the date hereof, the shareholders
of Omagine LLC (the  LLC Shareholders ) are: 

i.  
      Omagine, Inc. and   

ii.  
      Royal Court Affairs ( RCA ), an organization representing the personal interests of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, the ruler of Oman, and   

iii.  
      Two subsidiaries of Consolidated Contractors International Company, SAL ( CCIC ). CCIC is a 65 year old Lebanese multi-national company headquartered in Athens, Greece having worldwide and operating subsidiaries in among other places, every country in the MENA Region. In its fiscal years immediately prior to 2016, CCIC had approximately five (5) billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue and one hundred thirty thousand (130,000) employees but this may be reduced during its 2016 fiscal year as a result of adverse economic conditions in the MENA Region (See:  Market Conditions  below).  The two CCIC subsidiaries which are LLC shareholders are:   

a.  
      Consolidated Contracting Company S.A. ( CCC-Panama ), a wholly owned subsidiary of CCIC, and   

b.  
      Consolidated Contractors Oman Company LLC ( CCC-Oman ), CCIC s operating subsidiary in Oman.   

CCC-Panama and CCC-Oman are sometimes
referred to collectively in this report as  CCC . 

As previously reported several
obstacles were encountered with regard to concluding the construction contract for the Omagine Project with CCC (the  CCC-Contract ).
It recently appeared that these obstacles would be overcome via an agreement with CCC and an Omani bank with whom CCC has a business
relationship. CCC s introduction and long-standing relationship with the Omani bank was the impetus behind the proposed debt
financing and advisory services to LLC by the Omani bank. All efforts to date to conclude the CCC-Contract with CCC, and recently
to conclude an agreement with the Omani bank referred to us by CCC, have resulted in no forward progress. 

Management was originally pleased
in August 2016 by the prospect of concluding the drawn out negotiations with CCC to finalize the CCC-Contract and the Amended and
Restated Shareholder Agreement with CCC and RCA before concluding a term sheet with the Omani Bank, but all such CCC negotiations
once again foundered and management no longer sees that path as a viable way forward. 

 Also as previously reported, management
has been holding discussions in parallel with several potential LLC investors and as of the date hereof, we are in final discussions
with several such investors and have a signed agreement with one such investor. 

 We presently expect to amend the
Shareholder Agreement as necessary to memorialize the new arrangements and revisions to which the LLC Shareholders may agree (the
 Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement ). We presently expect that the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement
will be signed by the parties within the next month and that serious design, development and construction activities on the Omagine
Project will begin during the first quarter of 2017. 

 Management has also been conducting
parallel project finance discussions with a bank other than the Omani Bank with whom CCC has a business relationship, and we expect
a successful conclusion to that discussion to occur soon after the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement is executed by the
parties. 

 As these matters unfold, management
will report all material developments and agreements to its shareholders in a timely manner. 

 Management s primary goal continues
to be the launch in the first quarter of 2017 of serious design and construction activities for the Omagine Project. Management
cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Investors and
shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statement or forecast, which speaks only as
of the date hereof. 

The Shareholder Agreement     

Upon organizing Omagine LLC in 2009,
Omagine made an initial cash investment into LLC of OR 20,000 [$52,000] in consideration for the issuance to Omagine of 200,000
LLC Shares. 

Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement: 

The CCC Contract was not signed
on or before July 1, 2016 and the Shareholder Agreement is expected to be amended shortly by the Amended and Restated Shareholder
Agreement. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Shareholder Agreement, Omagine, Inc. has the option (the   OMAG Option )
to purchase the 225,000 Initial CCC Shares from CCC for 22,500 Omani Rials ($58,500). The OMAG Options are exercisable at any
time up to and including July 1, 2017 and Omagine, Inc. in its sole discretion, may assign the OMAG Option to any Person. (See:
 the CCC-Contract  below and the CCC-Panama Subscription Agreement and the CCC-Oman Subscription Agreement which are
integral parts of and fully incorporated into the Shareholder Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6). 

As of September 30, 2016 and the date hereof the LLC
shareholders have made cash investments into LLC as indicated in the following Table A: 

Table A  -  LLC
Shareholders  Cash Equity Investments into Omagine LLC  

As of September 30, 2016 and the date
hereof  RCA has made a non-cash payment-in-kind investment into LLC  as indicated in the following Table B: 

Table B  -  RCA s
Non-Cash Equity Investment into Omagine LLC  

As of July 1, 2016 and the date hereof
 RCA is obligated to make an additional Deferred Cash Investment into LLC  as indicated in the following Table C: 

Table C  -  RCA
Deferred Cash Equity Investment into Omagine LLC  

As of September 30, 2016 CCC, in management s
opinion, was obligated to make additional Deferred Cash Investments into LLC as indicated in the following Table D, however it
is management s present opinion that this is now unlikely to occur. 

Table D  -  CCC
Deferred Cash Equity Investments into Omagine LLC  

*  
      All conversions of Omani Rials to U.S. Dollars in this Report are calculated at an exchange rate of one (1) Omani Rial being equivalent to $2.60 except for the land valuation which is calculated at an exchange rate of one (1) Omani Rial being equivalent to $2.5974. See:  The Land Rights  and  Critical Accounting Policies , below.   

In order to bring the Omagine Project
to its present state, Omagine, Inc. (as of September 30, 2016), has: 

(ii)  
      expended $17.9 million of Pre-Development Expenses on behalf of the Omagine Project through the October 2, 2014 DA signing date consisting of both cash and non-cash expense items as Omagine, Inc. had promised to do pursuant to the SHA, and   

(iii)  
      single-handedly kept the Omagine Project and Omagine LLC financially afloat after the October 2, 2014 DA signing date by expending an additional $10.8 million on behalf of the Omagine Project via cash loans from Omagine, Inc. to Omagine LLC ( Loans ) and the direct payment by Omagine, Inc. of Omagine LLC liabilities and accounts payable consisting of both cash and non-cash items ( Advances ), neither of which Loans nor Advances Omagine, Inc. had any obligation whatsoever to do pursuant to the SHA.   

All such Pre-Development Expenses, Loans
and Advances are or will be liabilities of LLC, reimbursable to Omagine, Inc. in accordance with the terms of the Shareholder Agreement
(as may likely be amended; See: the following Table E, and  Pre-Development Expenses and Loans and Advances to LLC ,
below).

The foregoing summary of some of the
terms of the Shareholder Agreement and does not purport to be complete and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the SHA. The full text of the SHA is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6. RCA and Omagine, Inc. are presently in negotiations
with investors which may lead to an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement. 

The Omagine Project   

The Omagine Project is a mixed-use tourism
and residential real estate project. Subject to normal and customary scheduling changes during its development and construction
and to the current delays encountered in getting the CCC-Contract signed, the Omagine Project is now planned to be completed in
2022. It is being developed on one million square meters (equal to 100 hectares or approximately 245 acres) of beachfront land
(the  Existing Land ) facing the Gulf of Oman just west of Oman s capital city of Muscat and approximately six
miles from Muscat International Airport. Present development plans envision the creation of approximately a net additional 106,000
square meters of  Reclaimed Land  which together with the Existing Land will comprise approximately 1,106,000 square
meters of land (the  Project Land ). The Omagine Project will require substantial Project Finance to complete (See:
 The Shareholder Agreement , above and  Financial Advisor , below). 

The Omagine Project is planned to be
an elegant integration of cultural, scientific, heritage, entertainment and residential components, including seven pearl shaped
(20 meter diameter) buildings (the  Pearls ) located along an open boardwalk with associated entertainment exhibitions;
an amphitheater and stage; green landscaped spaces; a canal; an enclosed harbor and marina; boat slips and docking facilities;
retail shops; a variety of restaurants, cafes and entertainment venues; a five-star resort hotel; a four-star hotel; and possibly
an additional three or four-star hotel; shopping and retail establishments integrated with the hotels; commercial office buildings;
and more than two thousand elegant residences to be developed for sale by LLC. The ethos of the project is elegant but relaxed
entertainment and the Company expects that the Pearls will become  the Landmark  for the Sultanate of Oman. 

Pursuant to Omani Law, non-Omani persons
are not permitted to purchase land in Oman unless such land is located within an Integrated Tourism Project ( ITC )
such as the Omagine Project. The Government has designated the Omagine Project as an ITC and has issued a license to LLC (an  ITC
License ) thereby permitting the sale by LLC of the freehold title to the Project Land and to properties developed on the
Project Land to any person, including any non-Omani person. Since the Omagine Project will contain significant hospitality (hotels),
retail, commercial, and entertainment elements, LLC s business operations are expected over time to encompass real estate
development, hospitality, entertainment and property management. 

The Development Agreement and
the Usufruct Agreement     

Omagine s 60% owned subsidiary,
LLC, signed a Development Agreement ( DA ) with the Government of Oman in October 2014 for the development in Oman
by LLC of the Omagine Project. The legal effectiveness of the DA was conditional upon its ratification by Oman s Ministry
of Finance which Ratification occurred in March 2015. On July 1, 2015 (the  Operative Date ), the Government and LLC
entered into a Usufruct Agreement ( UA ) with respect to the Land Rights over the Existing Land and the DA and UA extend
such Land Rights to all of the Project Land. 

On July 2, 2015, after the UA was registered
by the Government legally perfecting LLC s ownership of the Land Rights, the Ministry of Tourism ( MOT ) of the
Government and LLC entered into an agreement (the  Operative Agreement ) making July 1, 2015 the  Operative Date 
from which all time periods for the execution by LLC of various tasks enumerated in the DA are to be measured. In the Operative
Agreement MOT states in relevant part:   We ask you to receive the land and begin procedures for executing the project
as per the development agreement entered into with you, keeping in mind that the effective commencement date of the development
agreement is 1 July 2015 .  The Operative Date is the date from which all time periods for the execution by LLC of various
tasks enumerated in the DA are to be measured (See Exhibits 10.8 and 99.2). 

The DA and UA are the contracts that
govern the design, development, construction, management and ownership of the Omagine Project, the use and sale by LLC of the Project
Land, and the Government s and LLC s rights and obligations with respect to the Omagine Project. In the event of any
conflict between the terms and conditions of the DA and the terms and conditions of the UA, the terms and conditions of the DA
control (See Exhibits 10.7, 99.1, 10.8 and 99.2). The term of the DA is 20 years and the term of the UA is 50 years (renewable)
commencing from the Operative Date. The UA and those DA provisions relevant to the UA survive the expiration of the term of the
DA. 

The Land Rights owned by LLC give it
extensive rights over the Project Land including the right to sell such Project Land on a freehold basis. LLC may use, control,
develop, retain, operate and/or sell the approximately 1.1 million square meters of Project Land to itself or to third parties.
The DA obligates LLC to pay the Government twenty-five (25) Omani Rials ($65) for each square meter of Project Land purchased directly
by LLC or sold by LLC to any third party (the  Land Price ). The average valuation for the Land Rights (net of such
Land Price is OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000) (See:  The Land Rights , below). 

The five year period commencing on the
Operative Date is a rent free period (the  Rent Free Period ) and thereafter LLC will pay annual rent to the Government
(the  Land Rent ) based on only the built but unsold commercial area (excluding the residential area) of the Omagine
Project (approximately 150,000 sq. meters) or approximately OR 45,000 ($117,000) per year based on the current annual per square
meter fee of OR 0.300 ($0.78). No Land Rent is due or owing during the Rent Free Period and no Land Rent is ever due or owing with
respect to plots of Project Land (i) on which there is a residential building, or (ii) on which there is not a substantially completed
non-residential building (i.e. Project Land that is open space, roads, non-residential building work-in-progress, etc. are rent-free). 

The continued legal effectiveness of
the DA subsequent to the Operative Date is dependent upon certain milestone dates being achieved (any or all of which may be extended
or waived by the Government), including: (1) LLC s delivery to the Government by June 30, 2016 of a term sheet with lenders
for the financing of the first or any other phase of the Project, [this milestone date was achieved by the term sheet and financing
agreement which LLC received from a Qatari bank in November 2015], (2) LLC s submission to the Ministry of Tourism of a social
impact assessment by March 31, 2016 and the Government s approval thereof by June 30, 2016, (3) the Government s approval
by June 30, 2016 of the development control plan for the Omagine Project, and (4) the transformation of LLC into a joint stock
company by June 30, 2016 (these milestone dates 2, 3 and 4 are not yet achieved and are expected to be extended if and when the
Operative Date is extended). 

MOT and LLC management have been in
communication with regard to the delays encountered to date by LLC in meeting certain DA milestone dates as measured from the Operative
Date. The MOT (and all Government Ministries) are acutely aware of the unusual fiscal strains imposed on the present banking and
economic environments in the region. In this regard on September 26, 2016 management met with the Minister of Tourism and his senior
staff to update MOT on recent events and to discuss the matter of extending the Operative Date. While no conclusive extension of
the Operative Date was made in the meeting, the MOT anticipates that a follow up meeting with management will be made by end of
year and management is hopeful and presently expects that the Operative Date will be extended once we finalize our ongoing negotiations
and agreements with respect to the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement. No assurance can be given however to what extent,
if any, that the Operative Date will in fact be extended by MOT. 

Pursuant to the DA, LLC must substantially
complete the construction of the seven Pearl buildings and one hotel (the  Minimum Build Obligation  or  MBO )
by June 30, 2020 (the  MBO Completion Date ), as such date may be amended or extended per the DA as indicated above.
The DA imposes no performance timelines on LLC with respect to completing the development or construction of elements of the Omagine
Project other than the MBO but the completion of the MBO will require LLC to obtain the necessary Project Finance to do so. Any
material breach by LLC of its obligation to perform the MBO would constitute an event of default under the DA. The DA specifies
that the principal construction contract (i.e. the CCC Contract) should be executed by June 30, 2016. This did not happen as indicated
above. LLC is required to provide written notice to the Government in certain circumstances, such as LLC s change in an anticipated
milestone date that would result in a substantial achievement of work to occur later than 60 days after such milestone date. Such
notice has been communicated both verbally and in writing to the appropriate government officials in recent communications with
them and was discussed further at the September 26, 2016 meeting with the Minister of Tourism. 

The Company undertook and financed
many development activities on behalf of LLC subsequent to the DA signing (the  Initial Activities ) in an effort to
fast-track the Omagine Project s development. The fast-track advantages sought to be gained thereby however have not materialized
due to LLC s failure to utilize the $25 million Al-Rayan Loan to finance the Initial Activities, LLC s ongoing operations
in Oman, and LLC s previously disclosed phase one design and construction activities (See: our previous disclosures in prior
reports filed with the SEC). 

The cause of such failure was the extended
and drawn out negotiations with CCC relevant to the CCC-Contract and CCC s Deferred Cash Investment after the November 2015
Financing Agreement Date. 

Because of these delays therefore, the
more serious and substantial design, masterplanning and construction activities for the Omagine Project did not begin in December
2015 as required for the fast-track development strategy and as management had planned. (See:  Initial Activities 
and  Pre-Development Expenses and Loans and Advances to LLC , below). The design, development and construction of the
Omagine Project will still benefit from these Initial Activities having been undertaken but not to the extent envisioned by our
planned fast-track development approach.  

Non-Omani persons (such as expatriates
living and working in Oman) are not permitted by Omani law to purchase land or residences in Oman outside of an ITC. The Government s
designation and licensing of the Omagine Project as an ITC therefore permits LLC to sell the freehold title to Project Land and
properties which are developed on Project Land to any Omani or non-Omani individual or juristic person worldwide. Properties within
an ITC enjoy a premium price relative to properties not in an ITC. Any Project Land or buildings remaining unsold at the expiration
of the 50 year Usufruct Term will revert to the Government. LLC does not anticipate that there will be any such unsold properties
at the expiration of the 50 year Usufruct Term. 

The foregoing summary of some of the
terms of the DA and of the UA does not purport to be complete and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts
of such agreements. The full text of the Development Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1. The full text of the
Usufruct Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.8 and 99.2 and also contained in Schedule 2A of the Development Agreement. 

The Land Rights     

The value of the Project Land has been
determined by three highly experienced professional valuation firms in accordance with the requirements and procedures specified
for such a valuation by (i) the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( RICS ) of London, England, and (ii) International
Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). Each of the three firms has a worldwide brand in the real estate valuation
business. 

In November 2014, LLC engaged the Oman office of Savills (http://www.savills.com/ ( Savills ) operating as Arabian Real Estate LLC (http://www.savills.om). Savills provides real estate services from over 600 offices worldwide, is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a FTSE 250 Index company.   

In December 2014, LLC engaged DTZ International Ltd., a Dubai, UAE firm with extensive experience in Oman (http://www.dtzglobal.com) ( DTZ ). DTZ is one of the top three global commercial real estate service companies, with more than 28,000 employees operating across more than 260 offices in 50 countries and $63 billion in transaction volume.   

In January 2015, LLC engaged Jones Lang LaSalle, UAE Limited, Dubai Branch (http://www.jll-mena.com/mena/en-gb/locations/Our-locations-in-MENA/dubai) ( JLL ). JLL has 53,000 employees operating across more than 230 offices in 80 countries.   

The Savills and DTZ final valuation
reports were received by LLC in January 2015. The JLL final valuation report was received by LLC in July 2015. The Company is of
the opinion that JLL s valuation is flawed and most probably represents a statistical outlier. In an abundance of caution
however, management has nevertheless determined to include the JLL valuation in its calculation of the average value of LLC s
Land Rights. The Land Rights valuations by the three aforementioned firms are summarized in the table below: 

In view of the changing economic conditions
in the MENA Region due to the fall in oil prices, LLC may commission an updated land valuation in the coming months. 

The Accounting Treatment for the
Land Rights   

Omagine and JOL prepare their financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) and the Company
prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. LLC s financial statements are prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). 

LLC has land under development valued
at 276,666,667 Omani Rials. Based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate, the Company recorded this land under development
in its financial statements at $718,614,000 and the Company has allocated this amount as follows: 188,963,334 Omani Rials ($490,813,363
based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate) to inventory; and 87,703,333 Omani Rials ($227,800,637 based on a $2.5974 per
1 Omani Rial exchange rate) to property. This land under development was purchased by LLC on July 2, 2015 pursuant to the terms
of the Shareholder Agreement whereby an LLC shareholder subscribed for 663,750 LLC Shares at a purchase price equal to the value
of the Land Rights. Since the Land Rights represented a non-cash payment-in-kind for the LLC Shares, it was necessary to value
the Land Rights. 

Three expert real estate valuation companies
were engaged by LLC to independently value the Land Rights in accordance with the professional standards specified by RICS and
IFRS. The average of the three Land Rights valuations was OR 276,666,667. (See:  The Land Rights , above and Exhibits
99.4, 99.5 and 99.6). 

Since the 276,666,667 Omani Rial value
of the Land Rights was substantial, LLC retained the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ( PwC ) to provide its
written analysis and report to LLC with respect to the correct IFRS accounting method LLC should use to record the 276,666,667
Omani Rial Land Rights value in its IFRS compliant financial statements. PwC did not advise on the valuation of the Land Rights
(as determined by Savills, DTZ and JLL), but only on the correct accounting LLC should use to record such Land Rights valuation
in LLC s financial statements in accordance with IFRS. PwC s written report was received by LLC in August 2015. Promptly
thereafter, LLC consulted with its independent auditor, Deloitte   Touche (M.E.)   Co. LLC ( Deloitte ) with
respect to the matter, and Deloitte s written technical analysis report (which agreed with PwC s analysis) was received
by LLC in November 2015. 

The Land Rights over the Project Land
are extensive, are closely akin to ownership rights and include the right to sell such land on a freehold basis. The Land Rights
are virtually equivalent to ownership rights and like any asset, if its value were to become impaired for any reason (including
any contractual reason pursuant to the DA requirements), a reserve for such impairment would need to be established at such time.
Although it is not required to do so, in view of the unsettled economic environment in Oman and the greater MENA Region, the Company
is considering updating these valuation reports in December 2016 to verify if any material changes in the value of the Project
Land may have occurred since the above three valuation reports were completed thereby possibly requiring the establishment of such
a reserve for impairment. Management s decision as to whether or not to undertake such updated reports will depend to a large
extent upon management s assessment of economic conditions in Oman in December 2016. Both PwC and Deloitte independently
concluded that the Land Rights should be recorded as capital and as tangible assets (work-in-process inventory and land) on LLC s
financial statements. With respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company s independent auditor
in the U.S. has likewise concurred that pursuant to US GAAP, the Land Rights should be recorded as capital, inventory and land. 

In determining the proper amounts to
be allocated to inventory and to land, LLC calculated the percentage (x) by dividing (y) the area of the land LLC presently plans
definitively to sell, by (z) the total area of the Project Land, and then multiplying that percentage (x) by 276,666,667 Omani
Rials to get the number (N) for inventory. The amount to be allocated to property was then calculated by subtracting N from 276,666,667
Omani Rials. Using its detailed internal financial model, management calculated (x) to be equal to 68.3%, thereby making the inventory
number (N) equal to 188,963,334 Omani Rials ($490,813,363 based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate) and the property number
equal to 87,703,333 Omani Rials ($227,800,637 based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate). In its consolidated financial
statements therefore, the Company has allocated the value of the Land Rights between (i) land under development which is held for
sale (inventory), and (ii) land under development which is held for investment (PP E). As more precise land use percentages
emerge during and after the masterplanning and construction of the Omagine Project, the percentage allocations for the value of
the Land Rights may be reclassified to distinguish between the land underlying properties that we will own and operate and those
which we will own and lease. 

Pre-Development Expenses and Loans
and Advances to LLC   

Prior to the DA being signed, Omagine
incurred significant costs related to marketing, planning, concept design, re-design, feasibility studies, engineering, financing,
promotions, capital raising, travel, legal fees, consulting and professional fees, other general and administrative activities
and similar such activities including preparing and making presentations to the Government and to potential investors and all other
activities and matters associated with the negotiation and conclusion of the DA with the Government (collectively, the  Pre-Development
Expenses ). The Shareholder Agreement defines the  Pre-Development Expense Amount  as the total amount of such
Pre-Development Expenses incurred before the DA was signed by the Government and LLC on October 2, 2014. 

Omagine, Inc. expended $17,920,114 to
pay for 100% of the Pre-Development Expense Amount. 

Subsequent to the October 2, 2014 DA
signing date and as of September 30, 2016, Omagine, Inc. has voluntarily - and without any obligation to do so - single-handedly
kept the Omagine Project and Omagine LLC financially afloat by expending an additional $10.8 million on behalf of the Omagine Project
via Loans and Advances to LLC. 

A summary of the Pre-Development Expense
Amount and of the Loans and Advances is detailed in the following table: 

Pre-Development Expenses, Loans and Advances 

The Pre-Development Expense Amount,
Loans and Advances are or will be liabilities of LLC; reimbursable to Omagine, Inc. in accordance with the terms of the Shareholder
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement now being negotiated may change the presently
existing terms and conditions of the existing Shareholder Agreement with respect to the Pre-Development Expense Amount and of the
Loans and Advances. 

The Pre-Development Expense Amount

Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement
as presently in effect, the date subsequent to the first Financing Agreement Date when LLC draws down the first amount of debt
financing is defined as the  Draw Date . 

The first Financing Agreement Date occurred
on November 29, 2015 when LLC and Masraf Al Rayan signed a Financing Agreement. A Draw Date pursuant to that Financing Agreement
never occurred however because CCC (represented by CCIC executive management), after first agreeing in December 2015 to promptly
(i) finalize the negotiation of the CCC-Contract (which in December 2015 was in an advanced stage of completion), (ii) sign the
CCC-Contract, and (iii) invest their Deferred Cash Investments immediately after the CCC-Contract was signed   subsequently
  and on several different occasions - changed its mind. Consequently, these matters have been the subject matter of numerous
and virtually continuous discussions and negotiations since December 2015 with many and varied interim  agreed agreements ,
all of which to date were  agreed  and then later forsaken by CCC. The CCC-Contract negotiations were ultimately abandoned
by management. (See:  The CCC-Contract , below). 

Further pursuant to the Shareholder
Agreement as presently in effect: 

1)  
      the liability for the Pre-Development Expense Amount shall be recorded on LLC s financial records on the Draw Date and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ), and   

2)  
      fifty percent (50%) of the Pre-Development Expense Amount will be paid to Omagine, Inc. on or within ten (10) days after the Draw Date, and   

3)  
      the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Pre-Development Expense Amount will be paid to Omagine, Inc. in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the Draw Date.   

The Loans and Advances to LLC   

The $10,838,378 of Loans and Advances
are payable to Omagine, Inc. by LLC on demand (but as a practical matter, not until LLC has the financial capacity to do so and
Omagine has no present intention of demanding immediate payment of the Loans and Advances). 

The Success Fee     

The Shareholder Agreement defines the
Success Fee as being equal to ten (10) million dollars. Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement as presently in effect: 

1)  
      the liability for the Success Fee shall be recorded on LLC s financial records on the Draw Date and in accordance with the IFRS, and   

2)  
      the Success Fee will be paid to Omagine, Inc. in five annual two (2) million dollar installments beginning on or within ten (10) days after the Draw Date.   

Omagine, may at its option, not enforce
the aforementioned payment schedules for the Pre-Development Expense Amount and/or the Success Fee as agreed in the Shareholder
Agreement and may agree to a different schedule for such payments and Omagine may likewise, at its option, refrain from demanding
payment of the Loans and Advances until LLC is in a financial position to make such payment. 

As of the date hereof, Omagine continues
to make Loans and Advances to and on behalf of LLC for the activities being undertaken by or on behalf of LLC in order to advance
the development schedule for the Omagine Project and expects to do so until the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement is agreed
and signed. 

The Amended and Restated Shareholder
Agreement (assuming it is agreed and executed) is expected to, among other things, address, restate and formalize the terms of
repayment by LLC to Omagine, Inc. of the Pre-Development Expense Amount, the Loans and Advances and the Success Fee but the manner,
terms and conditions to be agreed relative thereto is uncertain at this time. Management s primary goal continues to be the
launch of serious design and construction activities for the Omagine Project and management does not object to any reasonable resolution
of these and other matters preventing that goal from being accomplished. 

LLC Capital Structure  

As of the date hereof the LLC Shareholders
have made: 

LLC is presently capitalized as follows: 

As of the date hereof, as a result of
(i) Omagine having made its OR 210,000 ($560,000) Deferred Cash Investment into LLC, and (ii) RCA having made its OR 276,666,667
($718,614,000) non-cash PIK Investment of the Land Rights into LLC, LLC is presently obligated to issue a further 2,100,000 LLC
Shares to Omagine and a further 663,750 LLC Shares to RCA. As of the date hereof, neither CCC nor RCA have made their respective
Deferred Cash Investments into LLC. 

As of the date hereof, the ownership
percentages of LLC as registered at the Ministry of Commerce   Industry are as follows: 

RCA continues to be obligated to make
further cash investments into LLC in the aggregate amount of OR 7,640,625 [$19,865,625] but the timing and payment of such an RCA
Deferred Cash Investment may change from that memorialized in the Shareholder Agreement presently in effect to what may be agreed
in the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement. 

The Transformation   

At some time subsequent to the execution
of the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement, LLC intends to transform its corporate structure from a limited liability company
into a joint-stock company (the  Transformation ). 

The Shareholder Agreement also specifies,
among other things, the corporate governance and management policies of LLC and it provides for the LLC shares presently owned
by JOL to be transferred to Omagine subsequent to the signing of the DA. We presently expect this share transfer to occur at the
time of the Transformation of LLC into a joint stock company. 

The foregoing summary of the terms of
the Shareholder Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
Shareholder Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6. 

Banks, Investors and Contractors

The Al Rayan Bank    

As previously reported, in November
2015, LLC signed an agreement (the  Al Rayan Loan Agreement ) and arranged a $25 million loan (the  Al Rayan
Bank Loan ) with Masraf Al Rayan, a substantial Qatari bank. Management has continued to have discussions with Masraf Al
Rayan since November 2015 but it is management s opinion that the Al Rayan Loan Agreement and the Al Rayan Bank Loan will
not be utilized by LLC. 

The Omani Bank with whom CCC has
a business relationship   

Extended meetings and discussions with
CCC and with the Omani Bank with whom CCC has a business relationship resulted in changing, confusing and often contradictory paths
being followed before ending unsuccessfully. It was planned by all the LLC Shareholders that CCC and RCA would inject into LLC
a portion (an aggregate of approximately $26 million USD) of their  Deferred Equity Investments  (as such term is defined
in the Shareholder Agreement); that LLC would hire a the Omani Bank as its financial adviser and lender; that LLC would execute
a Phase One valued at approximately $220 million and consisting of one hotel, 250 residences and one Pearl; that LLC and CCC-Oman
will enter into the CCC-Contract; and that an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement would be executed, however all such plans
were apparently based on CCC providing the adequate corporate guarantee to the Omani bank   which to the best of management s
knowledge   did not happen. Discussions with the Omani bank and with CCC on this matter are now ended. 

Management however remains cautiously
optimistic that ongoing discussions with an alternative investor and an alternative bank may be concluded by the end of 2016. 

Design, Development   Construction:   

The design, development and construction
of the Omagine Project will be divided into various phases (each, a  Phase ). Since the CCC-Contract has not and will
not be signed, CCC will not likely be the General Contractor for the project and the construction Phases are now expected to be
put out to bid to various contractors. This bidding process is expected to garner substantial cost savings for LLC. 

Initial Activities   

The Immediate Post-DA Period was the
time period between the DA signing and the first Financing Agreement Date. The execution of many initial activities during this
period by LLC required the parallel launching by LLC management of many diverse efforts and processes on multiple fronts immediately
after the DA Execution Date of October 2, 2014. This early initiative fast track strategy (financed entirely by Omagine) greatly
benefited LLC to date in many ways, among which are: 

1.  
      the DA was Ratified by the Government;   

2.  
      the UA was signed and registered with the Government;   

3.  
      the Operative Date of July 1, 2015 replaced both the Execution Date of October 2, 2014 and the Effective Date of March 11, 2015 referenced in the DA;   

4.  
      three separate valuation studies and reports were commissioned and the valuation of the Land Rights was completed;   

5.  
      expert accounting analyses and reports were received from PwC, Deloitte and the Company s independent auditor regarding LLC s purchase of the Land Rights and the recording thereof in LLC s and the Company s financial statements;   

6.  
      LLC booked OR 276,666,667 of new equity which is also reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements;   

7.  
      a cost accounting budgetary framework to be used during the development, construction and marketing of the Omagine Project was created by an independent accounting and finance consultant;   

8.  
      an expert IT consultant was selected to architect and install the IT framework and solutions we intend to implement across LLC and the Company and across the Omagine Project s  smart city  environment;   

9.  
      an independent third party update to our feasibility study was commissioned and completed;   

10.  
      an update of LLC s internal financial model by specialist real estate investment bankers and advisers was commissioned and completed;   

11.  
      confirmation from banks in Oman (but not from banks outside of Oman) that the value of the Land Rights can be used as collateral to support the Syndicated Bank Financing was received;   

12.  
      the  Brand Identity  and associated brand pillar components and uniform brand messaging platform we intend to implement for Omagine, LLC and the Omagine Project were created;   

13.  
      LLC s strategic plan was completed;   

14.  
      multiple meetings with, and multiple iterations of proposals and presentations from major mission-critical project consultants (architects, designers, Masterplanners, engineers, program managers, quantity surveyors, real estate advisers, hospitality advisers, hotel management companies, financial advisers and others) have been received, reviewed and analyzed by management and selections of many consultants have been made by management;   

15.  
      candidates for ten senior LLC executive positions have been recruited, interviewed and selected;   

16.  
      extensive and multiple presentations and meetings with potential LLC equity investors in six MENA Region countries, Europe, Asia and the U.S. were conducted and while most offers were declined by LLC, negotiations with several selected strategic investors are still ongoing and discussions with one such investor have intensified recently;   

17.  
      extensive and multiple presentations and meetings with local, regional and international banks in Oman, the MENA Region and Europe with respect to the provision of Syndicated Bank Financing have occurred;   

18.  
      Multiple drafts of the CCC Contract were created (most recently in May 2016) and the final attempt to close this transaction ended unsuccessfully after many delays, and   

19.  
      several other contracts for mission-critical consultants are presently being prepared,   

The CCC Contract / Phase One    

All prior disclosures and discussion
of the CCC-Contract and to prior descriptions of Phase One are now inoperative, void and of no consequence since the CCC-Contract
was not and very likely will not be signed with CCC-Oman. Management s primary goal continues to be the launch of serious
design and construction activities for the Omagine Project. Discussions with CCC have ceased and the CCC Contract is not expected
to be signed at all.  

In August 2016, management was optimistic
and positively inclined to believe that a beneficial conclusion for all parties concerned would be forthcoming in a matter of several
weeks but no conclusion occurred and management presently believes that, for whatever reason, no amount of further negotiations
will result in a definitive conclusion of these matters with CCC. 

It is presently expected that several
building contractors will be involved in the project as the various Phases of the work is bid out to local contractors after the
design is substantially completed. As part of the masterplanning, we will develop a phasing program for the entire project and
as the design and/or specifications of any Phase is sufficiently completed such that LLC can tender it for competitive bidding
it will do so. CCC-Oman will be welcome to bid on any such Phase if it so desires. 

Any new construction contracts with
potential contractors will be modeled after the early draft CCC-Contract as envisioned by Omagine and will be based on internationally
accepted contracting standards promulgated by the International Federation of Consulting Engineers ( FIDIC ) and will
contain a set of industry standard performance parameters, incentives and penalties to ensure Omagine LLC s interests are
protected and that value is delivered. 

LLC will manage the bidding and competitive
process by which the various contractors will be chosen. There is an ample supply of qualified contractors in Oman. 

The contractor will only commence construction
activities on a Phase or section of a Phase after the competitive bids therefore are examined and a contract award is made by LLC. 

It is anticipated that several Phases
will be under construction simultaneously in an overlapping manner as the various designs and specifications for the various Phases
are sequentially completed. Construction on Phases will continue until the conclusion of all Permanent Works constituting the Omagine
Project are completed. 

LLC plans to maintain a robust control
of the design of the entire project and of each Phase through to completion. 

Development Phases / Construction
Phases / Project Financing / Masterplanning    

It is anticipated that the Omagine Project
will be developed in several phases and each such phase will likely include one or more Sections of construction. It is expected
therefore that several tranches of project financing from banks or other financial institutions will occur and several Financing
Agreements will likely be executed during the course of the project s phased development and construction. The first Financing
Agreement Date occurred on November 29, 2015 with the signing of the Al Rayan Loan agreement but as stated above that is now unlikely
to be utilized. Until other Financing Agreements are actually executed by the relevant parties however, no assurance can be given
that they actually will be so executed or that Project Financing will be available to LLC. Each such further Financing Agreement,
if any, is expected to coincide approximately with the beginning of a new development and construction phase, all of which phases
will include design, marketing and one or more new Sections of construction activities. The closing of a tranche of Project Finance
whether from banks, financial institutions or from Syndicated Bank Financing will each be likely memorialized by a separate Financing
Agreement. 

The November 29, 2015 execution date
of the first such Financing Agreement with Masraf Al Rayan is defined in the Shareholder Agreement as the  Financing Agreement
Date . The earlier that the Financing Agreement Date occurred, the better it was expected to be for LLC, the Omagine Project,
and all concerned for a variety of reasons but this was ultimately complicated by the CCC-Contract delays described herein. The
present liquidity squeeze in GCC banks which didn t exist a year ago may continue to have a negative impact on our Project
Finance efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the bank with which we are presently negotiating a project finance package
does not have any liquidity issues.  

LLC is presently exploring other possible
Equity Sales and Debt Facilities in order to finance the Omagine Project. One of such Debt Facility presently under consideration
by management is a secured loan from Omagine to LLC if and when sufficient funds are available to Omagine to make such loan. Like
any other Debt Facility, this would also be memorialized by a Financing Agreement. 

No assurance however can be given
at this time as to whether the Company will be successful in arranging either Equity Sales or Debt Facilities or in closing the
financing facility for the Omagine Project until such events actually happen.   

Any reference in this report to a term
or condition of the Development Agreement, the Usufruct Agreement and/or the Shareholders Agreement does not purport to be complete
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts of such agreements. The full text of the Development Agreement
is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1. The full text of the Usufruct Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.8 and 99.2.
The full text of the Shareholder Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6. 

Subject to the Amended and Restated
Shareholder Agreement being signed in December 2016 or January 2017, the masterplanning of the Omagine Project is planned to occur
in the first quarter of 2017. It is presently planned that in parallel with the masterplanning effort we will engage the hospitality,
real estate, insurance and marketing consultants to execute various professional studies which will inform the masterplanning process
and our business plan. These consultants and advisers all contribute to and inform the masterplanning and final design process
for the Omagine Project. 

The preliminary master plan along with
the various studies and our fleshed-out business plan (which in turn is informed by our now completed Strategic Plan) is expected
to be utilized by the financial adviser to drive the Syndicated Bank Financing effort.  

During the masterplanning process, exact
sizes, shapes and placement of the various project elements (residential, hotels, entertainment, landscape, etc.) are determined
and as the master plan evolves and takes shape, the various follow-on Phases of development and construction will also naturally
evolve. Simultaneously with these processes, the Financial Adviser will be updating the Omagine Project s financial model
to reflect the precise and final constituent project elements along with their projected costs and associated projected revenue
streams. Finally, all of the foregoing data and other marketing, sales and strategic planning studies created by or on behalf of
LLC are assembled into an  LLC Business Plan . With the LLC Business Plan in hand and with the LLC Financial Adviser
in the lead, LLC and the Financial Adviser and other select consultants set about the business of making final presentations to
the various banks, with which we are now and will continue to be in touch, with the objective of arranging the Syndicated Bank
Financing. 

Notwithstanding anything contained in
this report regarding possible, proposed or planned (i) sales of equity by Omagine and/or LLC ( Equity Sales ), or
(ii) debt facilities with banks, financial institutions or other persons (including loans from Omagine to LLC) or sale of debt
securities by LLC (collectively,  Debt Facilities ), or (iii) Syndicated Bank Financing or Project Finance, no assurance
can be given at this time as to whether the Company or LLC will be able to obtain the significant amount of financing and Project
Finance necessary over time to execute the development of the Omagine Project. 

Over the past many months, we have conducted,
and continue to conduct, numerous meetings: 

i.  
      with respect to LLC Equity Sales, with several potential equity investors interested in becoming shareholders of LLC, including sovereign funds, investment funds and high net-worth individuals from Europe, China, and several MENA Region countries, and   

ii.  
      with respect to Omagine Equity Sales, with investment funds and high net-worth investors in the U.S., Europe and the MENA Region interested in becoming shareholders of Omagine, and   

iii.  
      with respect to Debt Facilities for LLC other than Syndicated Bank Financing, with several banks and other potential investors (including Omagine) in the U.S., Europe, the GCC countries and Oman, and   

iv.  
      With respect to major local, regional and international banks in Oman and the GCC there appeared to be a significant amount of banking liquidity in 2015, but presently the banking liquidity levels are under severe pressure primarily as a result of the worldwide drop in the price of crude oil and resulting decrease in deposits into these banks by governments. Similarly the large appetite we witnessed in 2015 at such banks for providing Syndicated Bank Financing and Debt Facilities to LLC appears to have cooled in 2016.   

LLC management and financial executives
have held numerous meetings and discussions over the past several months with many major local and international banks, the purpose
of which, among other things, was to discuss the prospects for such banks providing the Syndicated Bank Financing which is expected
to be composed primarily of debt financing from banks. This is a crucial matter to address and accomplish in order to make the
Omagine Project a reality. Based on present assumptions, we estimate that LLC s peak Syndicated Bank Financing requirements
will be approximately $350 to $400 million during the multi-year development cycle of the Omagine Project. 

The process of obtaining project financing
is not a trivial exercise. It is a time-consuming and complicated process which, when successful, culminates in an event known
as a  Financial Close    usually several Financial Close events - as projects of the size and scope of the Omagine
Project are almost always developed in phases. With respect to any proposed Syndicated Bank Financing requirements, the question
of whether or not LLC s Land Rights can or will be used by the various banks as collateral to support such Syndicated Bank
Financing is therefore of considerable importance. At present LLC management is confident that banks within Oman will use LLC s
Land Rights as collateral for bank debt facilities for LLC but we are unclear as to the position of many of the regional and international
banks outside of Oman in this regard. 

The DA addresses this matter in considerable
length and clearly contemplates that LLC - as the registered owner of the Land Rights will be granting a security interest in its
Land Rights to banks and lenders to the project. The DA further obliges the Government - as the registered owner of the land -
to consent to any such grant of a security interest by LLC. (See: Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1, and Clause 22 of the DA - Lenders Security
Interests). The DA states in relevant part: 

the Government
shall enter into Direct Agreements with Lenders acknowledging their rights by way of Security Interests over certain assets of
the Project Company including an assignment to the Lenders of the Development Agreement, the Usufruct Agreement, other related
agreements, and the Project Assets     (See: Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1, Schedule 20 to the DA - Principles of Direct
Agreement). 

The major Omani banks with which LLC
management has met - and with whom we continue to meet and update - have indicated that LLC s Land Rights will be considered
by such Omani banks as collateral to support bank financing debt facilities for the Project Finance for the Omagine Project but
other non-Omani regional and international banks have been less forthcoming with definitive answers until they see more details
about the nature and extent of LLC s Land Rights.  

LLC management is presently confident
that the OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000) value of its Land Rights will be considered by the Omani banks as collateral for the Syndicated
Bank Financing for the Omagine Project but it remains unclear at this stage whether or not banks other than Omani banks will do
likewise. Notwithstanding the foregoing statement however, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty what future
events may alter LLC s present assessment of its ability to use its Land Rights to collateralize any bank debt financing
including any Syndicated Bank Financing. 

Updated Studies   

In addition to the valuation studies
and reports with respect to the Land Rights (See:  The Land Rights , above), management also commissioned: 

(i)  
      an updated feasibility study of the Omagine Project by an independent third party which is a professional real estate, tourism and marketing consultant, and   

(ii)  
      
     an updated LLC internal financial model for the Omagine Project by unaffiliated third parties who are expert financial,
    investment banking and real estate consultants.   

Both the updated feasibility study and
the financial model have been completed and they will be utilized by LLC to fine tune its development plans, and ultimately by
LLC s designated Financial Adviser for the balance of the project in arranging the Syndicated Bank Financing and other financing
for LLC as may be required. 

Omagine LLC s internal financial
model is updated, modified and adjusted from time to time in order to capture what management believes are the then present market
realities and projected trends. The financial model is organized to show best case, worst case and probable case scenarios. The
most recently updated probable case scenario forecasts substantial net positive cash flows for Omagine LLC over the seven year
period subsequent to the signing of the DA and a net present value ( NPV ) of the Omagine Project of approximately
$1.4 billion dollars. Management believes its financial model assumptions are reasonable but cautions that they may change as new
facts and information become available, as the development program and design process unfolds and as market conditions require.
It is virtually certain that the various components of the financial model - and therefore the estimates of total cash flow and
NPV - will change from time to time in line with market fluctuations and as the project unfolds. 

The sale of residential and commercial
properties are a large revenue driver supporting Omagine LLC's internal financial projections. The OR 276,666,667 average valuation
of the Land Rights has had a positive effect on projected revenue at LLC. 

Management cautions that investors
should not place undue reliance on the aforementioned financial model projections or on estimates by market participants mentioned
herein as all such projections, estimates and forecasts are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which
are beyond the Company's control, and no assurance can be given that the projections will be realized or that the estimates or
forecasts will prove to be accurate. Potential investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking
statement or forecast, which, unless otherwise noted to the contrary, speaks only as of the date hereof.   

Off Plan Sales and Land Price
Payments   

As is present practice in Oman, LLC
anticipates that sales contracts with third party purchasers of residential or commercial properties that are purchased  off
plan  (i.e. purchased before the construction thereof), will stipulate the payment to LLC by such purchasers of (i) a deposit
on signing of such sales contract, and (ii) progress payments during the construction period of the relevant property covered by
such sales contract. Since the aggregate of such deposit and progress payments before and during the construction of the relevant
property is expected to be approximately 85% of the sales price of the relevant property stipulated in such sales contract, LLC
anticipates that (i) the construction costs for properties that are sold  off plan  will be substantially  owner-financed 
by the relevant purchaser, and (ii) it will likely be unnecessary therefore for LLC to utilize any or very much Syndicated Bank
Financing in order to pay for the construction costs of properties which are sold pursuant to  off plan  sales contracts.
Management expects that this commonly accepted sales contract and payment process will significantly benefit LLC by reducing its
aggregate requirements for Syndicated Bank Financing from its banks. The consumer appetite for such  off plan  sales
is less today than it was in recent years. (See  Market Conditions  below). 

Furthermore, Land Price Payments to
the Government are not due or owing from LLC until such time as LLC legally transfers the freehold title to land to a purchaser
at the time of the closing of the sale of such land. Such closings will only occur after LLC has received final payment of the
relevant sales contract amount from the purchaser. LLC s financing profile is therefore further enhanced since it is not
obligated to make any Land Price Payments to the Government until after it has already received 100% of the contracted sales price
amount from the relevant purchaser at the closing when the freehold title to such land and property is transferred to the purchaser. 

Consolidated Results    

The financial results of LLC are included
in the consolidated financial results of the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The Company experienced a substantial increase in capital on July 2, 2015 when the Land Rights were registered in LLC s
name and recorded in LLC s and the Company s financial statements. The Company will experience another substantial
increase in capital, if and when the then appropriate percentage representing Omagine s ownership interest in LLC is recorded
in the Company s consolidated financial statements. LLC's ongoing financial results will be included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company as appropriate for as long as Omagine remains a shareholder of LLC. 

In addition to the activities mentioned
above, the Company s preparations for its future business activities also include, but are not limited to: (i) negotiating
various agreements with other major vendors, contractors, consultants and employees proposed to be involved in the Omagine Project,
(ii) arranging the appropriate and required legal, accounting, tax and other professional services both in Oman and the U.S., (iii)
reviewing and complying (to the extent we are presently able) with the listing requirements of various stock exchanges so we may
be prepared to apply for such listing(s) as soon as we are eligible, (iv) examining various other matters we believe will enhance
shareholder value, and (v) examining other potential Company revenue streams which are ancillary to, and derivative of, the Omagine
Project. 

The Company plans to enter businesses
other than real estate development - and ancillary to, and derivative of, the Omagine Project - and the Company presently expects
to generate ongoing revenue streams from such businesses, but no projections of the amount of such revenue, if any, can be made
at this time. 

Although the Company had expected to
generate revenue in the medium term as LLC (i) began reimbursing Omagine for its Pre-Development Expenses, and (ii) begins paying
the Success Fee installments to Omagine, such reimbursements are now likely to be delayed (See:  Pre-Development Expenses
and Loans and Advances to LLC  and  Success Fee  above). The Company is not expected to generate revenue from
sales or operations of properties within the Omagine Project until the development and construction of the Omagine Project is substantially
underway. The masterplanning, development and construction of the Omagine Project is now expected to begin in the first quarter
of 2017. 

Financial Adviser    

LLC s financial adviser ( Financial
Adviser ) for Phase One is expected to be a bank or other professional financial consulting company. As such the Financial
Adviser will arrange the syndication among several banks of the debt financing ( Syndicated Bank Financing ) for the
Omagine Project. 

It is presently expected that a definitive
agreement between LLC and its Financial Adviser will be executed in the first quarter of 2017. No assurance however can be given
that any such agreement will be signed until it is actually signed by the parties. 

Importantly, given the present liquidity
issues at local and MENA Region banks, the matter of Project Finance is an issue that now moves to the forefront (from its previously
deferred position) of all developer s and contractor s agendas. While the required Project Finance for the Omagine
Project (estimated at approximately $400 million)   or any project   is not usually needed until after the masterplanning
and design phase is complete or near complete, given present economic strains both developers and contractors are well advised
to seek to lock up a Project Finance commitment early on rather than waiting to start a syndication at a later date. 

LLC s Financial Adviser will advise
on capital structure and lead the arrangement and placement of the Syndicated Bank Financing. LLC will then work together with
its Financial Advisor to appoint lead arrangers for such Syndicated Bank Financing which may include the Financial Advisor itself. 

The amount of Syndicated Bank Financing
owed at any one time by LLC to its Lenders is expected to fluctuate over the development and construction cycle of the Omagine
Project and will be greatly influenced by (i) any additional Equity Sales, and (ii) the pace and tempo of LLC s receipt of
proceeds from its planned sales of real estate to third parties. The capital of LLC, proceeds from Equity Sales if any, Syndicated
Bank Financing and the proceeds from sales of its residential and commercial properties, are expected to be utilized by LLC to
develop the Omagine Project. 

The maximum amount of such Syndicated
Bank Financing presently expected to be outstanding at any one time during the development and construction cycle of the Omagine
Project is presently estimated by management to be between $350 million and $400 million. 

We have had extensive discussions with
a number of MENA Region financial institutions with respect to such Syndicated Bank Financing and while they remain interested
in discussing the Project Finance for the Omagine Project, virtually all such banks confirmed the tightening of bank liquidity
due to the current economic climate resulting from the sharply reduced price for crude oil. We are presently in discussions with
a bank which is not experiencing such liquidity issues and which has already given LLC a  soft commitment  with respect
to the provision by it of the debt financing required for the Omagine Project. With LLC s Financial Adviser leading this
effort, management remains hopeful with respect to LLC s prospects for arranging the Syndicated Bank Financing for the Omagine
Project but recognizes that given present economic and market conditions, it is not a trivial task and will be challenging. These
discussions are ongoing and no assurances can be given at this time regarding the outcome, if any, from such discussions. The DA
recognizes and addresses this issue when it states, in relevant part: 

The Government recognizes
that the Project Company intends to raise limited recourse financing in relation to the Project and that Lenders may expect to
be afforded certain rights in relation to it. Accordingly, the Project Company will by or before the completion of twelve (12)
months from the Execution Date  [now the Operative Date of July 1, 2015; see Exhibits 10.7, 99.1, 10.8 and 99.2]  enter into
a written term sheet with the Lenders for the financing of the First Phase, any other phase or all of the Project (a  Term
Sheet ). If the Project Company has not delivered a copy of such Term Sheet to the Government by or before the expiry of
the twelve (12) month period referred to above, this Development Agreement then shall have no further effect.   (See Exhibits
10.7 and 99.1). 

The condition referred to above was
fulfilled on November 9, 2015 when LLC entered into a written term sheet with Masraf Al Rayan with respect to the financing of
the First Phase of the Omagine Project. 

MENA Region banks and financial institutions
continue to maintain adequate levels of liquidity but the rapid fall in world oil prices is a challenge to those banks whose liquidity
relies to a great deal on government deposits resulting from the sale of crude oil. Such new and large government borrowings from
commercial banking institutions tend to crowd out commercial borrowing capacity for private companies. The largest banks of course
are weathering this storm more handily then the mid-size or smaller banks. The project financing environment in Oman and the MENA
Region continues to remain cautious after the rapid decline of worldwide oil prices which led to the rapid decline of bank deposits
being received from governments. LLC management has met recently with several internationally recognized Financial Advisers, all
of whom have deep and wide-ranging expertise in the MENA Region project financing markets and as part of their normal business
activities are in regular contact with MENA Region banks and international financial institutions regarding the status of and conditions
prevailing in the project finance marketplace. The Company is now cautiously optimistic (and less confident then it had been before
the 2015 sudden drop in oil prices) that LLC and its yet to be designated Financial Adviser will be able to arrange the necessary
project financing for the Omagine Project. Management believes that all the Financial Advisers and banks with whom it has recently
met concur that there is currently still a reasonable degree of liquidity and appetite among MENA Region banks and financial institutions
for lending to, and investing in, sound development projects in the MENA Region. Most such persons and institutions however are
more cautious than they were a year ago because of the recent rapid fall in oil prices and the continuation of the unsettled military
activities ongoing in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. 

No assurance can be given at this time
that LLC will be able to obtain any, or a sufficient amount of, the project financing required to develop, build and complete the
Omagine Project. If such a circumstance were to occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 

Market Conditions  

As previously disclosed and as has been
and continues to be widely reported by local and international media and press, the worldwide price of crude oil fell very suddenly
and dramatically  in 2014 and 2015 ( from over $100 per barrel to about $25/$30 per barrel )
as robust production in the U.S. and elsewhere created a global glut of crude oil . Presently the price of crude oil is about
$45/bbl. Almost all countries in the MENA Region are dependent on the sale of crude oil to support their economies and their government
spending programs. 

Although MENA Region governments had
100s of billions of dollars of savings in sovereign reserve funds, this oil price shock ushered in an extremely challenging environment
for the MENA Region governments and for the companies of all types   including contractors   operating in the MENA
region. In reaction to the large, rapid and unexpected drop in crude oil prices, government budgets were slashed across the region;
contractors  payments were delayed; and many government sponsored projects were postponed, delayed or cancelled.  Payment
delays and stalled government projects off the back of the decline in oil prices have severely impacted the entire construction
industry in the MENA Region   including in Oman. The  Omagine Project however is not a government sponsored project
and Omagine LLC is a private company. 

Crude oil prices  seem 
to have recently stabilized around the mid-$40s per barrel price and a  rebalancing of the market  seems
to be  is in progress  but the knock-on effects of the lower government spending and the delayed payments by MENA Region
governments to contractors has had a severe economic impact on local economies and contractors. 

Almost all local banking institutions
in the MENA Region are dependent on large deposits from oil and gas sales by governments in order to provide the normally excess
liquidity apparent in the local banking system prior to this recent dramatic worldwide drop in oil prices. With the sudden fall
in deposits from oil sales, bank liquidity at local banking institutions in the GCC and wider MENA Region are under immense pressure
as deposits have fallen dramatically while simultaneously governments became large borrowers where they were not before. 

Now however even some of the largest
contractors are experiencing difficulties. CCIC is a very large multi-national contractor with significant financial resources
but they too had to adjust accordingly to the present economic realities. 

We expect that this sudden business
cycle change will eventually right itself as all market participants adapt to the new realities but we are of the present opinion
that, the Company has succeeded in creatively making a path where none had apparently previously existed. These current economic
conditions however, should they continue unabated, could cause a knock-on effect in the real estate markets resulting in slower
or fewer sales and lower selling prices. 

The market intelligence garnered by
management indicates that local bankers and market participants believe that both transaction volume and pricing in the Omani real
estate market are stable and are expected to improve in 2017 relative to expected performance in 2015 and 2016. We are presently
unsure what the impact on transaction volume and pricing will be from the fall in crude oil prices but we expect some softness
in the market as all participants adjust to the  new normal  of $40 to $50 crude oil prices. From a timing perspective,
LLC plans to now launch residential and commercial sales at the Omagine Project in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. 

Trends in the Omani market during the
past few years have indicated a reduced presence of speculative buyers and a reduced consumer appetite for pre-sales of residence
units ( off-plan  sales) as buyers now frequently demand a finished product before entering into sales contracts with
developers. Although, many societal disorders, military activities and terrorism continue in other parts of the MENA Region, as
long as the politically stable and quite safe conditions existing at present in Oman persist then, market conditions should favorably
impact LLC s future operations. 

Nearby Dubai is experiencing softness
in its residential sales and leasing market but in general Dubai s economy (a regional barometer) remains relatively strong
and, in certain areas, quite robust. Raw material and labor prices remain somewhat volatile in Oman having recently experienced
both downward and upward swings over the past year   but overall construction costs are sharply down due to the severe competition
presently in the market among building contractors. 

In Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya, among
other countries, daily violent military clashes and terrorism are now commonplace. Other Arab countries in the MENA Region have
experienced and are experiencing demonstrations of discontent with the rule of their heads of state and in some cases these demonstrations
are being met with violent pushback by some MENA Region governments but this was not and is not the case in politically and economically
stable Oman. Anxiety over the health of His Majesty, the much beloved Sultan Qaboos, and what effect, if any, that will have on
Oman s political stability and leadership succession seems to have abated and His Majesty has recently returned to Oman from
a medical checkup in Germany and is seen to be actively managing state affairs. 

Construction material costs and property
selling prices in Oman and the surrounding region remain somewhat volatile and undue reliance on present forecasts should be avoided.
Management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
Management fully expects that its cost estimates for the Omagine Project (and therefore, its financial model) will require adjustment
  possibly significant adjustment   as future events unfold. Investors and shareholders are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on any such forward-looking statement or forecast, which speaks only as of the date hereof. 

Nearby Dubai leads the way for the Gulf
tourism market and this is likely to be the case for the foreseeable future, given its existing visitor market, attractions, its
impressive future capital development and marketing investment programs, and especially given its recent selection as the host
for EXPO 2020 which is expected to attract over 25 million visitors. 

Sales and Marketing  

LLC plans to undertake several wide
ranging and continuous marketing, advertising, branding and public relations campaigns to establish its brand identity in anticipation
of its late 2017 launch of residential and commercial properties for sale and to advertise and promote its forthcoming entertainment,
hospitality and retail offerings. 

As we move forward we plan to construct
and operate a sales showroom at the Omagine Site. The sales office/showroom will be staffed with experienced real estate sales
personnel and will contain large scale models of the Omagine Project and its various components as well as associated collateral
sales and marketing materials. 

The anticipated launch date for residential
and commercial sales is presently planned to be in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. Management expects that the continuing
stability of local real estate markets as well as the Government s continuing improvements to Oman s infrastructure
(Muscat International Airport, roads, regional airports, etc.) will contribute positively to LLC s future sales prospects.
The impact of the recent fall in crude oil prices and the knock-on economic effects on consumers and government projects is unknown
and difficult to predict at this time. 

Management expects the Omagine Project
to benefit from Dubai s hosting of EXPO 2020, and similarly from nearby Qatar s hosting of the World Cup Games in 2022.
Both of these events are expected to attract a huge amount of visitors and tourists. The Omagine Project will be conveniently located
one hour from Dubai and Qatar by air and is easily accessible by a fine roadway system in both Oman and the U.A.E. A visit to the
Omagine Project will be a natural and logical addition to a Dubai or Qatar visit. 

Sale prices and rental rates for housing
in other integrated tourism projects in the Muscat area of Oman have remained stable during 2015 and as of the date of this report.
The inventory of unsold housing in the secondary (re-sale) market (both outside of and within ITCs) has diminished due to recent,
albeit quite price-sensitive, sales activity. New housing inventory, especially smaller apartments designed to hit perceived market
price-points, has continued to come onto the local Muscat area market and the market absorption rates (number of market transactions)
for such new residential housing is strong. The DA allows for sales and pre-sales of any of the residential or commercial buildings
that will be developed and built on the Omagine Site. 

The DA stipulates the obligation of
the Government to issue such Licenses and Permits as may be required for the development of the Omagine Project, including but
not limited to issuing an Integrated Tourism Complex License ( ITC License ) designating the Omagine Project as an
ITC. On June 26, 2014, the Government issued an ITC License to LLC designating the Omagine Project as an ITC. 

Non-Omani persons (including expatriates
living and working in Oman) are forbidden by Omani law to purchase land, residences or commercial properties in Oman  unless
such land, residences or commercial properties are located within an ITC . Because it is now licensed as an ITC, the land, residences
and commercial properties within the Omagine Project may be sold to any buyer worldwide - including any non-Omani buyer - and the
freehold title to such land, residences and commercial properties may be transferred to such buyers. Residences in ITCs are viewed
to be highly desirable by purchasers (by both investors and owner-occupiers) and ITC residences therefore enjoy a premium selling
price relative to non-ITC residences. Purchasers of residences within Omagine (or any ITC) are entitled by Omani Law to be issued
a resident visa (for themselves and their immediate family). 

The excellent location of the Omagine
Site is recognized by local market participants and the significance of the provision of the Omagine Site to LLC is substantial.
The increase in the value over the last several years of the land constituting the Omagine Site has had a positive effect on the
valuation of the Land Rights and is expected to have a positive effect on LLC s revenue from the sale of residential and
commercial properties. The value of the land constituting the Omagine Site is expected to be a primary driver of future LLC and
Company revenue and the benefits accruing to LLC and the Company pursuant to LLC s Land Rights over the Project Land is expected
to be material and significant. 

Pursuant to the DA and UA, LLC will
pay the Government OR 25 ($65) per square meter for the Project Land it sells to third party purchasers. The average valuation
for the Land Rights (net of such Land Price) is OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000) (See:  The Land Rights , above). 

Design, Engineering, Construction,
Program Management, Content Development    

The Company does not presently own or
directly operate any design, engineering, content development or construction companies or facilities. With assistance from Omagine
via the Loans and Advances, LLC has during the Immediate Post-DA Period undertaken many critical tasks as indicated above, but
for LLC to fully accomplish its objectives and undertake and finance the Omagine Project, it will have to close an Equity Sale
or Debt Facility transaction (or a combination thereof), the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement and a construction contract.
The failure to date to accomplish these matters with CCC has delayed the Omagine Project and the masterplanning process. 

Subject to the approval of its shareholders
and to negotiating and agreeing to a contract, LLC presently intends to hire Michael Baker International ( Baker )
or a similar internationally prominent firm as its Program Manager and Project Manager. Baker is in the business of providing program
and project management, engineering, design and construction management services to a wide variety of clients including the U.S.
Department of Defense and many state governments and commercial clients. Omagine has employed Baker through the feasibility and
engineering study phases of the Omagine Project. 

Baker is headquartered in Pittsburgh,
PA, with offices throughout the U.S. and in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and is experienced in all aspects of engineering,
program management and construction management for large scale construction and development projects of the magnitude of the Omagine
Project. Baker has significant program management and construction management contracts with the United States military worldwide,
including in the MENA Region. The Company believes it maintains a good working business relationship with Baker but recognizes
that there are presently many such highly reputable program and project management companies available and operating in Oman. The
Company is confident that Baker s inability or unwillingness to perform or the loss of Baker s services altogether,
(none of which circumstances are presently anticipated by or known to the Company), would not have any adverse impact on its or
LLC s business or operations. 

The interpretive design, entertainment
content, and visitor experience design candidates to be hired by LLC have been narrowed to a short list of professional companies.
One or more of such companies ( Content Developers ) will be engaged by LLC to design the transformation of Omagine s
high level strategic vision for the content of the Pearl structures and surrounding areas into physical places offering emotional,
intellectual and physical experiences and interactions. Each of the prospective Content Developers has serviced a diverse client
base, including theme parks, museums, zoos, aquariums and other such complex entertainment centers around the world, including
in the MENA Region, and each continues to regularly produce world class attractions globally of the size and scope of the Omagine
Project. 

LLC presently intends to hire
various local Omani contractors for the construction of the Omagine Project (See:  The CCC Contract , above).   

 To date, Omagine has generally conceived
the development concepts and defined the  scope of work  and then, as required, contracted with various designers,
architects, contractors and consultants in the United States, Europe and the Middle East to perform those tasks. LLC will engage
various firms as its consultants (master planner, engineers, real estate and hospitality consultants, etc.) who will together with
management finalize the design for the entire Omagine Project. There are many such consultants available with competitive pricing
and the Company does not believe that the loss or inability to perform of any such consultant which it has selected would have
a material, adverse impact on its business or operations. The Company believes it maintains a good working business relationship
with its consultants. As presently planned, all copyrights to all material documents, designs and drawings executed by such independent
designers, architects, contractors and consultants are, or will be, the property of either LLC or Omagine. 

Results of Operations  : 

Overview    

The Company is expected to generate
revenue in the near to medium term as (depending on the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement)
LLC begins reimbursing Omagine for its Pre-Development Expenses and the Loans and Advances and begins paying the Success Fee installments
(See:  Pre-Development Expenses and Loans and Advances to LLC , above) but is not expected to generate revenue from
operations in the near term until the development of the Omagine Project is substantially underway. The Company will need to generate
sustainable operating revenue in order to attain its objectives and sustain its operations going forward.  

As the development program for the Omagine
Project becomes more detailed and as the planning and design processes progress, the estimates of construction and development
costs have and will become proportionately more accurate. LLC presently expects, based on the current assumptions underlying its
updated development program, that the development costs (including the costs for design, construction, program management and construction
management) for the Omagine Project will be between $2.1 and $2.5 billion dollars. 

The costs of labor and materials as
well as the selling prices and market absorption rates of new residential and commercial properties remain somewhat volatile in
Oman and accurate forecasts for such future costs, selling prices or market absorption rates cannot be made at this time. (See
 Market Conditions  and  Sales and Marketing , above). 

LLC nevertheless presently expects,
based on current assumptions and market activity that such residential selling prices during its planned multiple sales releases
beginning in late 2017 will be at least equal to the prices that are presently budgeted by LLC. 

In their opinion on our 2014 audited
financial statements, our auditors expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern but in our September
30, 2016 unaudited financial statements included in this report and in our December 31, 2015 audited financial statements that
expression of concern has been removed. Beginning in the Company s September 30, 2015 consolidated financial statements and
continuing to date, the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect a substantial increase in capital resulting from
the inclusion therein as of July 2, 2015 of the value of the Land Rights purchased by LLC. 

 In October 2016, Omagine entered
into two notes, one of which was convertible, for aggregate proceeds to the Company of $125,000. In November 2016 another note
which is only convertible upon default was executed for net proceeds to the Company of $150,000.  

 Our single most important strategic
objective for the past many years was achieved when the DA was signed by Omagine LLC and the Government of Oman on October 2, 2014.
Since that time the DA has been ratified by the Government, the UA has been signed by and registered with the Government and LLC s
Land Rights have been valued by three outside independent experts at an average valuation of seven hundred eighteen million six
hundred fourteen thousand dollars ($718,614,000). 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 vs.  

  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

 The Company did not generate any
revenue or incur any cost of sales during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company is relying on
Omagine LLC s operations for the Company s future revenue generation. Management is presently examining other possible
sources of revenue for the Company which may be added to the Company s operations. 

 Total selling, marketing, general
and administrative operating expenses ( SG A Expenses ) were $738,590 during the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to $3,689,287 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. This $2,950,697 (80%) decrease in SG A Expenses
was attributable to the following expense categories: officers and directors compensation including stock based compensation ($1,862,630),
consulting fees including stock-based compensation ($1,386,390), Travel ($2,677), Occupancy ($30,993) and other selling, general
and administrative costs ($74,908) offset by increases in professional fees ($256,901) and commitment fees ($150,000). 

 The Company sustained a net loss
of $677,045 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $3,695,678 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This $3,018,633 (82%) decrease in the Company's net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior
period was principally attributable to the $2,950,697 decrease in SG A Expenses mentioned above and an increase in amortization
of debt discounts ($12,500), increase in interest expense ($8,035) and an increase in net loss attributable to non-controlling
interests in LLC ($88,471). 

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 vs.  

  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

 The Company did not generate any
revenue or incur any cost of sales for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

 Total SG A Expenses were $2,176,004
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4,963,778 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
$2,787,774 (56%) decrease was attributable to the following expense categories: officers and directors compensation including stock
based compensation ($1,662,297), consulting fees including stock based compensation ($1.279,653), Travel ($34,672), Occupancy ($78,762)
and other selling general and administrative costs ($82,753) offset by increases in professional fees ($200,363) and commitment
fees ($150,000). 

The Company sustained a net loss
of $2,159,877 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $4,935,261 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. This $2,775,384 (56%) decrease in the Company's net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
prior period was principally attributable to the $2,787,774 decrease in SG A Expenses mentioned above and an increases in
amortization of debt discounts ($34,533), increase in interest expense ($15,205) and an increase in net loss attributable to non-controlling
interests in LLC ($37,348). 

    Liquidity and Capital Resources    

 The Company incurred net losses of $2,159,877
and $4,935,261 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company had a decrease in cash of $312,280 resulting from the positive cash flow of $930,700 from financing activities
offset by a negative cash flow of $1,242,980 from operating activities. Financing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 consisted of proceeds from the sale of Common Stock of $584,000, proceeds of $540,000 from a note payable to YA II PN,
Ltd. (p/k/a YA Global Master SPV, Ltd.) ( YA ) (the March 2016 YA Loan), proceeds of $360,000 from a note payable to
YA (the June 2016 YA Loan), proceeds of $1,700 from the exercise of stock options and proceeds of $100,000 from the issuance of
a convertible note payable to an entity owned by two Independent Directors of Omagine, Inc., offset by payment of five monthly
installments totaling $225,000 for the 2015 YA Loan, payment of six monthly installments totaling $315,000 for the March 2016 YA
Loan, and payment of three monthly installments totaling $115,000 for the June 2016 YA Loan. 

The Company had $0 in capital expenditures
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company
had $490,836,876 in current assets, consisting of $490,813,363 of land under development held for sale (See Note 2 to the Company s
consolidated financial statements), $12,423 of cash and $11,090 in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Company's current
liabilities at September 30, 2016 totaled $2,306,901 consisting of $482,110 of convertible notes payable and accrued interest,
$514,842 of notes payable and accrued interest, $942,072 of accounts payable and accrued expenses and $367,877 of accrued officers 
payroll. At September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $488,529,975 compared to working capital of $489,652,283 at
December 31, 2015. Thirty-three percent (33%) of the $2,306,901 of current liabilities at September 30, 2016 ($768,915) is due
and owing to officers and/or directors of Omagine. 

 The $1,122,308 decrease in the Company's
working capital at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is attributable to the increase in current liabilities ($819,351)
and a decrease in cash ($312,280) offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets ($9,323). The Company s
liabilities at September 30, 2016 increased compared to December 31, 2015 due to increases in notes payable and accrued interest
($310,675), accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities ($446,452) and convertible notes payable and accrued
interest ($84,181) offset by decreases in accrued officers  payroll ($21,957). 

Warrants   

As of September 30, 2016, Omagine has
6,422,124 Common Stock purchase warrants ( Warrants ) issued and outstanding, 3,211,062 of which are exercisable for
the purchase of one Common Share at a per Common Share exercise price of $5.00 and 3,211,062 of which are exercisable for the purchase
of one Common Share at a per Common Share exercise price of $10.00 (collectively, the  Strategic Warrants ). 

Management is hopeful that the 6,422,124
outstanding Strategic Warrants will eventually become  in the money  and will be exercised which will provide a future
source of additional financing for Omagine.  

Strategic Warrants   

Of the 6,422,124 Strategic Warrants
distributed, 3,211,062 are exercisable at $5 per Common Share and 3,211,062 are exercisable at $10 per Common Share. On January
14, 2016, Omagine filed a Post-Effective Amendment on Form S-1 (Commission File No. 333-183852) to update the previous registration
of all 6,422,124 then issued and outstanding Strategic Warrants and the 6,422,124 Common Shares underlying such Strategic Warrants
(the  Updated Warrant Registration ). The SEC declared the Updated Warrant Registration effective January 25, 2016.
The effective status of the Updated Warrant Registration expired on October 21, 2016 and the Company intends to file an updated
post-effective amendment to maintain the warrants effective status of such registration statement. Pursuant to a Board of Directors
resolution dated August 12, 2015, the expiration date of all Strategic Warrants was extended from December 31, 2015 to December
31, 2016. All other terms and conditions of the Strategic Warrants remained unchanged. 

Tempest Warrants   

On June 24, 2014, Omagine issued the
1,000,000 Tempest Warrants to an investor each of which are exercisable for the purchase of one restricted Common Share at a per
Common Share exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $1.00 per Common Share, or (b) 80% of the closing sale price for a Common
Share on the Trading Day immediately preceding the relevant exercise date (See: Exhibit 4.4). On August 15, 2014, such investor
transferred 240,000 Tempest Warrants to an affiliate and such affiliate exercised 240,000 Tempest Warrants on August 15, 2014 at
$1.40 per share for the purchase of 240,000 restricted Common Shares. On October 2, 2014, such investor transferred an additional
250,000 Tempest Warrants to such affiliate and such affiliate exercised 250,000 Tempest Warrants on October 2, 2014 at $1.31 per
share for the purchase of 250,000 restricted Common Shares. On June 29, 2015, the investor exercised 158,228 of the Tempest Warrants
at an exercise price of $1.58 per Common Share for proceeds of $250,000. Subsequently on October 8, 2015, such investor transferred
an additional 2,375 Tempest Warrants to an affiliate and such affiliate exercised 2,375 Tempest Warrants on October 8, 2015 at
$1.28 per share for the purchase of 2,375 restricted Common Shares. All 349,397 remaining Tempest Warrants expired on June 23,
2016 and are no longer exercisable. 

Standby Equity Distribution Agreements   

Between 2009 and 2011, Omagine had a
Stand-By Equity Distribution Agreement with an affiliate of YA (the  2009 SEDA ). Omagine and YA were parties to a
second Stand-By Equity Distribution Agreement (the  2011 SEDA ) which was terminated on July 21, 2014. The 2009 SEDA
and the 2011 SEDA are collectively referred to herein as the  Prior SEDAs .  

On April 22, 2014, Omagine and YA entered
into a new Standby Equity Distribution Agreement which was amended on October 10, 2014 (the  2014 SEDA ). The 2014
SEDA is generally on the same terms as the 2011 SEDA. 

Any use by Omagine of the 2014 SEDA
will be guided by several factors, including but not limited to: (i) the availability and cost of alternative financing, (ii) our
ability to rapidly access required financing, (iii) the liquidity and market price of our Common Stock, (iv) the exercise, if any,
of Warrants, (v) the likelihood (or actuality) of the success of our present efforts to arrange (a) new equity investments into
Omagine and (b) new debt and/or equity investments into LLC, (vi) the likelihood (or actuality) of LLC having the financial capacity
to pay Omagine the $10 million Success Fee and the Pre-Development Expense Amount and Post-DA Pre-Development Expenses in excess
of $28.2 million. (See:  Financial Advisor , and  The Shareholder Agreement ,  LLC Capital Structure ,
 Pre-Development Expenses / Post-DA Pre-Development Expenses , above), and (vii) our then current cash requirements. 

Because the market for our Common Stock
has historically exhibited low liquidity levels, we may not be able to take full advantage of the 2014 SEDA if such liquidity levels
do not improve. If the market for our Common Shares is exhibiting low liquidity levels at the time we give YA an Advance Notice
(a  Put ) and if YA sells Common Shares into the public market during the five Trading Day Pricing Period subsequent
to our Put (as is YA s customary practice), it is likely that the price of our Common Shares will decline. Any such price
decline will immediately increase the number of Common Shares we would otherwise be required absent such price decline to deliver
to YA subsequent to the Pricing Period in satisfaction of such Put. If this pattern continued to happen with subsequent Puts by
us, it is likely that we would issue and sell to YA the maximum 3,000,000 shares available under the 2014 SEDA before reaching
the aggregate sales price of $5 million available under the 2014 SEDA. 

LLC is now obligated to design, develop
and construct the $2.5 billion Omagine Project. Given the size and scope of the Omagine Project, it is expected that LLC will require
a minimum of $300 million (possibly up to $500 million) of debt financing / project financing (including the Construction Financing)
over various times during the next 4 to 5 years. This Construction Financing requirement will not be addressed by utilizing the
2014 SEDA. Notwithstanding that fact, the Company expects to have substantial and rapidly forthcoming working capital requirements
other than the Construction Financing for a portion of which it plans to utilize the 2014 SEDA but no assurance can be given that
the Company will be able to obtain the necessary working capital. 

Given the considerable resources we
will be required to bring to bear to execute the Omagine Project, we presently expect that we will fully utilize the entire $5
million amount available to us under the 2014 SEDA. Such use of the 2014 SEDA will of course be guided by the price, liquidity
and volatility of our Common Stock as we move forward. We cannot presently predict what other future sources of financing might
become available to us to cause us to utilize less than the full $5 million available under the 2014 SEDA and our present assessment
is that, we will surely need the full $5 million available under the 2014 SEDA. The Prior SEDAs indisputably provided the Company
the lifeline needed to achieve the DA signing and the 2014 SEDA will likely provide some of the supplementary working capital the
Company will need going forward. 

Prior SEDAs  

The 2009 SEDA expired in 2011. The 2011
SEDA was due to expire on September 1, 2014 but was terminated on July 21, 2014 by the mutual consent of the parties (See: Exhibit
10.19). 

In connection with the 2011 SEDA, Omagine
filed with the SEC a registration statement (the  2011 SEDA Registration Statement ) on Form S-1 (Commission File No.
333-175168) pursuant to which 3,244,216 Common Shares were registered (including 244,216 Common Shares issued to YA in May and
June 2011 in satisfaction of the $300,000 commitment fees due under the 2011 SEDA). Between August 24, 2011 and May 6, 2014, YA
purchased 561,690 Common Shares from Omagine under the 2011 SEDA for an aggregate Purchase Price of $835,000 and YA did not
thereafter purchase any Common Shares from Omagine under the 2011 SEDA. On July 21, 2014 Omagine filed a post-effective amendment
to the 2011 SEDA Registration Statement de-registering the previously registered 2,438,310 Common Shares which were not issued
or sold to YA pursuant to the 2011 SEDA. Such post-effective amendment to the 2011 SEDA Registration Statement was declared effective
by the SEC on July 25, 2014. 

The 2014 SEDA   

On April 22, 2014, Omagine and YA entered
into a new Standby Equity Distribution Agreement which was amended on October 10, 2014 and thereafter amended again on September
20, 2016 to extend the term of the SEDA (the  2014 SEDA ). The 2014 SEDA is generally on the same terms as the 2011
SEDA. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the 2014 SEDA shall automatically expire on the earlier of (i) February
1, 2019, or (ii) the date on which YA shall have made payment of Advances pursuant to the 2014 SEDA in the aggregate amount of
$5,000,000. In satisfaction of a $150,000 commitment fee due pursuant to the 2014 SEDA, Omagine issued 85,822 restricted Common
Shares (the  Commitment Fee Shares ) to YA Global II SPV, LLC which is an affiliate of YA (the  Affiliate ).
In satisfaction of a $150,000 commitment fee pursuant to the  Second SEDA Amendment  in September 2016, the Company
issued 161,290 restricted shares to the Affiliate. 

Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 SEDA,
Omagine may in its sole discretion, and upon giving written notice to YA (an  Advance Notice ), periodically sell Common
Shares to YA ( Shares ) at a per Share price ( Purchase Price ) equal to 95% of the lowest daily volume
weighted average price (the  VWAP ) for a Common Share as quoted by Bloomberg, L.P. during the five (5) consecutive
Trading Days (as such term is defined in the 2014 SEDA) immediately subsequent to the date of the relevant Advance Notice (the
 Pricing Period ). 

Omagine is not obligated to sell any
Shares to YA but may, over the term of the 2014 SEDA and in its sole discretion, sell to YA that number of Shares valued at the
Purchase Price from time to time in effect that equals up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate. YA is obligated
under the 2014 SEDA to purchase such Shares from Omagine subject to certain conditions including (i) Omagine filing a registration
statement with the SEC to register the resale by YA of the Shares sold to YA under the 2014 SEDA ( Registration Statement ),
(ii) the SEC declaring such Registration Statement effective (the date of such declaration by the SEC being the  Registration
Effective Date ), (iii) Omagine certifying to YA at the time of each Advance Notice that Omagine has performed all covenants
and agreements to be performed and has complied with all obligations and conditions contained in the 2014 SEDA, (iv) periodic sales
of Shares to YA must be separated by a time period of at least five Trading Days, and (v) the dollar value of any individual periodic
sale of Shares designated by Omagine in any Advance Notice may not exceed the greater of (a) two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000),
or (b) the average of the  Daily Value Traded  for each of the five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of
the relevant Advance Notice where Daily Value Traded is the product obtained by multiplying the number representing the daily trading
volume of Common Shares for such Trading Day by the VWAP for Common Share on such Trading Day. 

Pursuant to the 2014 SEDA in no event
shall the number of Common Shares issuable to YA pursuant to an Advance cause the aggregate number of Common Shares beneficially
owned (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), by YA and its affiliates to
exceed 9.99% of the then outstanding common stock of the Company. In addition this 9.99% ownership cap may not be waived by YA
or Omagine and since such ownership cap includes all Common Shares owned by any YA affiliate, such cap cannot be avoided by transferring
Common Shares to an affiliate of YA. 

In connection with the 2014 SEDA, on
October 15, 2014 Omagine filed the Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register the 3,085,822 Common Shares covered by the 2014
SEDA. On January 8, 2015, Omagine filed an amendment to that Registration Statement and such amendment to the 2014 SEDA Registration
Statement was declared effective by the SEC on January 22, 2015. Post-Effective Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 to the SEDA Registration
Statement were filed with the SEC on December 21, 2015 and January 6, 2016, respectively, to maintain the effectiveness of the
SEDA Registration. On January 13, 2016, the SEC declared the SEDA Registration effective. The Company plans to file a post-effective
amendment with the SEC to reinstate the effectiveness of the SEDA Registration which expired on October 9, 2016. 

The foregoing summaries of the terms
of the Prior SEDAs and of the 2014 SEDA do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full
texts of the Prior SEDAs and the 2014 SEDA, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.14, 10.15 and 10.18. 

Sales of Common Shares to YA pursuant
to the Prior SEDAs totaled 561,690 Common Shares for an aggregate Purchase Price of $835,000. Management believes that it has been
judicious and conservative in its use to date of the Prior SEDAs, but nonetheless our periodic sales of Common Shares to YA or
its affiliate pursuant to the Prior SEDAs have been dilutive to all shareholders and the subsequent resales by YA of such Common
Shares into the public market have from time to time inflicted downward pressure on our stock price. Omagine intends to utilize
the 2014 SEDA to fund its ongoing operations as and if necessary and as of the date of this Report, the Company has sold 48,985
shares of its Common Shares pursuant to the 2014 SEDA for proceeds of $50,000. 

The YA Loan Agreements   

Omagine and YA, the investment fund
which is a party with Omagine to the 2014 SEDA, entered into an unsecured loan agreement dated July 26, 2013 (the  2013 YA
Loan Agreement ). Pursuant to the 2013 YA Loan Agreement, Omagine borrowed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) from YA
(the  2013 YA Loan ) for a term of one year at an annual interest rate of 10%. The 2013 YA Loan Agreement called for
a 10% monitoring and management fee equal to $20,000 to be escrowed and paid to Yorkville Advisors thereby making the net proceeds
from the 2013 YA Loan to Omagine equal to $180,000. Such $180,000 of proceeds was received by Omagine on September 3, 2013. The
2013 YA Loan Agreement also extended the expiration date of the 2011 SEDA. The foregoing summary of the terms of the 2013 YA Loan
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2013 YA Loan Agreement attached
hereto as Exhibit 10.21. 

On April 22, 2014, Omagine and YA entered
into another unsecured loan agreement (the  2014 YA Loan Agreement ) whereby Omagine borrowed five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000) from YA (the  2014 YA Loan ) for a term of one year at an annual interest rate of 10%. Pursuant
to the 2014 YA Loan Agreement, on April 22, 2014, through deduction from the $500,000 principal balance of the 2014 YA Loan, Omagine
(i) paid the $110,680 balance then due under the 2013 YA Loan Agreement, (ii) paid a $39,000 commitment fee with respect to the
2014 YA Loan, and (iii) prepaid the $1,096 of interest due on the 2014 YA Loan for the period April 23, 2014 through April 30,
2014. The $349,224 net proceeds of the 2014 YA Loan was received by Omagine on April 23, 2014. The foregoing summary of the terms
of the 2014 YA Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the YA Note
Purchase Agreement, the YA Note and the YA Closing Statement attached hereto as Exhibits 10.22; 10.23; and 10.24 respectively.
Omagine repaid the 2014 YA Loan pursuant to its terms. 

On May 20, 2015, the Company and YA
entered into a third loan agreement (the  2015 YA Loan Agreement ). Pursuant to the 2015 YA Loan Agreement, the Company
borrowed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) from YA (the  2015 YA Loan ) for a term of one year at an annual
interest rate of 10%. Pursuant to the 2015 YA Loan Agreement the Company agreed to pay a $50,000 commitment fee with respect to
the 2015 YA Loan to YA Global II SPV LLC, an affiliate of YA (the  Affiliate ). The $500,000 proceeds of the 2015 YA
Loan was received by the Company on May 21, 2015 and the $50,000 commitment fee was paid to the Affiliate. The foregoing summary
of the terms of the 2015 YA Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the YA Note Purchase Agreement, the YA Note and the YA Closing Statement attached hereto as Exhibits 10.25; 10.26; and 10.27
respectively. 

In 2016, the Company and YA entered
into two additional loans. On March 15, 2016, the Company and YA entered into a loan agreement (the  March 2016 YA Loan Agreement ).
Pursuant to the March 2016 YA Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) from YA (now named YA
II PN, Ltd.) (the  March 2016 YA Loan ) for a term of one year at an annual interest rate of 10%. Pursuant to the March
2016 YA Loan Agreement the Company agreed to pay off the $150,575 balance due as of March 15, 2016 under the 2015 YA Loan Agreement
and to pay a $60,000 commitment fee with respect to the March 2016 YA Loan to YA Global II SPV LLC, the Affiliate. At the closing
on March 15, 2016 of the March 2016 YA Loan, the appropriate amounts representing the balance due under the 2015 YA Loan Agreement
and the commitment fee for the March 2016 YA Loan were deducted from the $600,000 principal balance of the March 2016 YA Loan and
paid to YA and the Affiliate. The $349,425 proceeds of the March 2016 YA Loan were received by the Company on March 15, 2016. The
foregoing summary of the terms of the March 2016 YA Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the YA Note Purchase Agreement, the YA Note and the YA Closing Statement attached hereto as Exhibits 10.28;
10.29; and 10.30 respectively. On June 22, 2016, the Company and YA entered into another loan agreement (the  June 2016 YA
Loan Agreement ). Pursuant to the June 2016 YA Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000)
from YA (the  June 2016 YA Loan ) for a term of one year at an annual interest rate of 10%. Pursuant to the June 2016
YA Loan Agreement the Company agreed to pay a $40,000 commitment fee with respect to the June 2016 YA Loan to the Affiliate. At
the closing on June 22, 2016 of the June 2016 YA Loan, the commitment fee for the June 2016 YA Loan was deducted from the $400,000
principal balance of the June 2016 YA Loan and paid to the Affiliate. The $360,000 proceeds of the June 2016 YA Loan was received
by the Company on June 22, 2016. The foregoing summary of the terms of the June 2016 YA Loan does not purport to be complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the YA Note Purchase Agreement, the YA Note and the YA Closing Statement
attached hereto as Exhibits 10.38; 10.39; and 10.40 respectively. Omagine presently anticipates that the March 2016 YA Loan and
the June 2016 YA Loan will be repaid from proceeds of sales of Common Shares made pursuant to (a) private placement transactions,
(b) the exercise of Warrants, or (c) the 2014 SEDA, or a combination thereof. 

There can be no assurance given that
Omagine will be able to successfully utilize the Warrants or the 2014 SEDA to secure the significant amount of financing necessary
for it to execute its business plan as presently conceived or that we will be able to repay the March 2016 YA Loan or the June
2016 YA Loan. 

The St. George Investments LLC
Loan Agreement   

On November 14, 2016, the Company entered into
an interest free Convertible Promissory Note with St. George Investments LLC for the principal amount of $185,000 due on May 15,
2017, six months from the funding date of November 16, 2016, convertible into the Company s Common Stock only in the case
of non-payment or in the Event of Default at a Conversion Price equal to 60% of the three lowest daily Volume Weighted Average
Prices for the Company s Common Stock during the twenty trading days immediately preceding the Conversion. The Company may
prepay the Note in whole or in part at any time without penalty. After deduction of a $30,000 original issue discount (OID) and
legal fees of $5,000, the Company received net proceeds of $150,000 on November 16, 2016. (See: Exhibits 10.42 and 10.43, the
Note Purchase Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement). 

Omagine LLC   

 LLC presently has limited and
strained resources. 

 Omagine invested the OMR 20,000
cash [$52,000] OMAG Initial Equity Investment into LLC upon its organization and pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement the following
additional investments have been made to date into LLC: 

LLC is presently capitalized at
OMR 277,026,667 [$719,550,000]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LLC presently has limited cash resources because expenses incurred
to date have depleted LLC s limited cash capital. 

 As of the date hereof Omagine
has invested OMR 210,000 [$546,000] in advance of when Omagine was obligated to do so in order to maintain LLC s liquidity
and has satisfied in full its obligation pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement to make the OMAG Deferred Investment into LLC. 

 RCA is presently obligated to
make its Deferred Cash Investment into LLC in the aggregate amount of OR 7,640,625 [$19,865,625]. However it is possible that the
Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement will modify when such Deferred Cash Investment will be made by RCA. 

 The OMR 276,666,667 [$718,614,000]
investment of the Land Rights into LLC by RCA was perfected on July 2, 2015 concurrent with the registration of the Usufruct Agreement
with the Oman Ministry of Housing (See:  The Land Rights , above). 

 The continuation of LLC s
business to date has been financed by Omagine. 

 LLC will have to arrange a significant
amount of project financing, including most probably Syndicated Bank Financing, in order to execute its plan to develop the Omagine
Project.   Until Financing Agreements with respect to such additional financing are actually executed by the parties, no assurance
can be given that they actually will be so executed or that such project financing will be available to LLC  . (See  Financial
Advisor , above). The Company is relying for revenue growth upon the future business of LLC. 

   Omagine Inc.   

 In order to generate the cash
needed to sustain the Company s ongoing operations, Omagine has over the past many years relied on the proceeds from the
YA Loans and from sales of Common Shares made pursuant to the Prior SEDAs and the 2012 rights offering as well as from sales of
restricted Common Shares and notes made pursuant to private placements. Management is hopeful that the Warrants will provide a
future source of additional financing but it is not possible to predict if any of our Warrants will ever be exercised. 

 Subject to the necessary financial
resources being available to it, Omagine may make a secured loan to LLC in order to finance its operations. Such a loan from Omagine,
if it were to be made, would be memorialized by a Financing Agreement like any other Debt Facility. 

 Investors and shareholders should
be aware that we have had no revenue for the past several years and we do not expect to generate any revenue until after the development
of the Omagine Project is well underway. 

 The failure to ultimately secure
project financing via the closing of a Financing Agreement would have a materially significant adverse effect on the Company s
ability to continue operations. 

    Capital Expenditures
and Construction Financing    

 The Company did not incur any
capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2016. We expect, assuming we are able to close one or more of the debt or equity
facilities we are presently working on, that in the near term (i) the Company will incur significant expenses related to capital
expenditures, and (ii) LLC will incur substantial debt associated with project financing for the Omagine Project. 

We presently expect that such
capital expenditures will be largely concentrated at LLC and will largely comprise the purchase by LLC and Omagine of the quantities
of office equipment, furniture, vehicles, computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment which will be necessary
to service the expanded staff and offices required at both LLC and Omagine to manage the ramping up of our business operations
in Oman and the U.S. 

 We presently expect that such capital
expenditures will be financed: 

i.  
      at Omagine via the proceeds from sales of Common Shares via the 2014 SEDA, the exercise of Warrants, private placement sales of restricted Common Shares, and the payments received from LLC with respect to the Success Fee, the Pre-Development Expense Amount and the Advances and Loans, and   
 
      ii.  
      at LLC through a combination of invested capital, Equity Sales, bank loans and project finance Debt Facilities (See:  Business - The Shareholder Agreement / LLC Capital Structure,  and  Master planning/Equity Sales/Debt Facilities/Project Financing ).   
 
 No assurance can be given that
such financing will be available to the Company at either Omagine or LLC. 

 We presently expect that any future
project financing requirements (including any Syndicated Bank Financing) for LLC will be placed with regional and international
banks as arranged by LLC with the assistance of its Financial Adviser. LLC s requirement for project financing is expected
to be reduced by its ability to pre-sell residence and commercial units by entering into sales contracts with third party purchasers
and receiving deposits and progress payments during the construction of such units. Recent trends in the Omani market however have
indicated a reduced consumer appetite for pre-sales of residence units as many more buyers are now demanding a finished product
before entering into sales contracts with developers. . (See:  Financial Advisor  and  Market Conditions 
and  Sales   Marketing ).  

    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

 We have not entered into and have
no present intention of entering into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. We have not formed and have no present intention
of forming any special purpose entities. 

  Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk  

 Information required under this
caption is not required for the Registrant since it is a smaller reporting company. 

  Item 4 - Controls and Procedures  

   Management s Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

 The Company's disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in this report is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Such controls also include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 Under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including the Registrant's chief executive and financial officer, the Company carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of such disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report (the  DCP Evaluation ). 

 Based on this DCP Evaluation,
the Registrant s principal executive and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

   Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting   

 There were no changes during the
Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

Item 2 - Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

 In connection with the Prior SEDAs and
with the issuance by us of the Tempest Warrant and the Common Shares listed below, we relied upon the exemption from securities
registration afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. No advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the
securities. The offerings and sales were made to a limited number of persons, all of whom were accredited investors, business associates
of our Company or executive officers or directors of our Company and transfer was restricted by our Company in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Act. In addition to representations by the below-referenced persons, we made independent determinations
that all of the below-referenced persons were accredited or sophisticated investors, that they were capable of analyzing the merits
and risks of their investment and that they understood the speculative nature of their investment. Furthermore, all of the below-referenced
persons were provided with access to our SEC filings.

 THE NOVEMBER 14, 2016 CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE BETWEEN OMAGINE AND ST. GEORGE INVESTMENTS LLC

Exhibit 10.42  

CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTE   

FOR VALUE RECEIVED,  Omagine,
Inc. , a Delaware corporation (  Borrower  ), promises to pay to  St.
George Investments LLC , a Utah limited liability company, or its successors or assigns (  Lender  ), $185,000.00
and, if applicable, any interest, fees, charges, and late fees on the date that is six (6) months after the Purchase Price Date
(the   Maturity Date  ). This Convertible Promissory Note (this   Note  ) is issued and made
effective as of November 14, 2016 (the   Closing Date  ). This Note is issued pursuant to that certain Note Purchase
Agreement dated November 14, 2016, as the same may be amended from time to time, by and between Borrower and Lender (the   Purchase
Agreement  ). Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in  Attachment 1  attached hereto and incorporated
herein by this reference. 

This Note carries an OID
of $30,000.00. In addition, Borrower agrees to pay $5,000.00 to Lender to cover Lender s legal fees, accounting costs, due
diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of this Note (the   Transaction
Expense Amount  ), all of which Transaction Expense Amount is included in the initial principal balance of this Note.
The purchase price for this Note shall be $150,000.00 (the   Purchase Price  ), computed as follows: $185,000.00
initial principal balance, less the OID, less the Transaction Expense Amount. The Purchase Price shall be payable by Lender by
wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

1.             Prepayment;
Interest . 

1.1.           Interest .
No interest shall accrue on the Outstanding Balance of this Note unless and until an Event of Default (as defined below) occurs.
Immediately following the occurrence of any Event of Default, interest shall automatically accrue on the Outstanding Balance beginning
on the date the applicable Event of Default occurred at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate
permitted under applicable law. Interest calculated hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
(12) thirty (30) day months, shall compound daily and shall be payable in accordance with the terms of this Note. 

1.2.          Prepayment .
Borrower may repay this Note in whole or in part at any time without penalty. 

2.             Security .
This Note is unsecured. 

3.             Conversion . 

3.1.          Conversions .
Lender has the right at any time following an Event of Default, at its election, to convert (each instance of conversion is referred
to herein as a   Conversion  ) all or any part of the Outstanding Balance into shares (  Conversion Shares  )
of fully paid and non-assessable common stock, $0.001 par value per share (  Common Stock  ), of Borrower as per
the following conversion formula: the number of Conversion Shares in the relevant Conversion shall be equal to the amount of the
Outstanding Balance being converted in such Conversion (the   Conversion Amount  ) divided by the Conversion Price
(as defined below). Conversion notices in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit A  (each, a   Conversion Notice  )
may be effectively delivered to Borrower by facsimile, email, mail, overnight courier, or personal delivery, and all Conversions
shall be cashless and not require further payment from Lender. Borrower shall deliver the Conversion Shares from any Conversion
to Lender in accordance with Section 8 below. 

3.2.          Conversion
Price . Subject to the adjustments set forth herein, the conversion price (the   Conversion Price  ) for each
Conversion shall be equal to 60% (the   Conversion Factor  ) multiplied by the average of the three (3) lowest
daily VWAPs for the Common Stock during the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion. Additionally,
if at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Borrower is not DWAC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor
will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future Conversions. If at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default, the
Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by an additional
5% for all future Conversions. Finally, in addition to the Default Effect, if any Major Default occurs concurrent with or after
the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default for failure to pay the Outstanding Balance on the Maturity
Date), the Conversion Factor shall automatically be reduced for all future Conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first
three (3) Major Defaults that occur after the occurrence of such Event of Default (for the avoidance of doubt, each occurrence
of any Major Default shall be deemed to be a separate occurrence for purposes of the foregoing reductions in Conversion Factor,
even if the same Major Default occurs three (3) separate times). For example, the first time Borrower is not DWAC Eligible, the
Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes of this example. Following such
event, the first time the Conversion Shares are no longer DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter
will be reduced from 55% to 50% for purposes of this example. If, thereafter, there are three (3) separate occurrences of a Major
Default pursuant to Section 4.1(a), then for purposes of this example the Conversion Factor would be reduced by 5% for the first
such occurrence, and so on for each of the second and third occurrences of such Major Default. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in any of the Transaction Documents, the parties hereby agree that if any shares
of Common Stock cannot be electronically transferred via DWAC and DTC procedures solely because of the existence of a 144 Event
(as such term is defined in Attachment 1   Definitions) with respect to such shares of Common Stock, then such Common Stock
relevant to such 144 Event shall not be deemed to be either (a) not DWAC Eligible, or (b) not DTC Eligible solely because of such
144 Event and, absent any other impediment to DWAC Eligibility or DTC Eligibility, such Common Stock shall at all times and in
all cases and respects be deemed to be DWAC Eligible and DTC Eligible. 

4.            Defaults
and Remedies . 

4.1.          Defaults .
The following are events of default under this Note (each, an   Event of Default  ): (a) Borrower fails to pay
any principal, interest, fees, charges, or any other amount when due and payable hereunder; (b) Borrower fails to deliver any Conversion
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof; (c) a receiver, trustee or other similar official shall be appointed over Borrower
or a material part of its assets and such appointment shall remain uncontested for twenty (20) days or shall not be dismissed or
discharged within sixty (60) days; (d) Borrower becomes insolvent or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they
become due, subject to applicable grace periods, if any; (e) Borrower makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors;
(f) Borrower files a petition for relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law (domestic or foreign); (g) an involuntary
bankruptcy proceeding is commenced or filed against Borrower and such proceeding shall remain uncontested for twenty (20) days
or shall not be dismissed or discharged within sixty (60) days; (h) Borrower defaults or otherwise fails to observe or perform
any covenant of Borrower as specifically set forth in Section 4 of the Purchase Agreement; (i) any representation or warranty made
by Borrower to Lender herein or in any Transaction Document in connection with the issuance of this Note is false or misleading
in any material respect when made; (j) the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction without Lender s prior written consent;
(k) Borrower fails to maintain the Transfer Agent Reserve as required under the Purchase Agreement or to add shares to the Transfer
Agent Reserve as required under the Purchase Agreement within three (3) Trading Days of Borrower s receipt of a written notice
from Lender requesting an increase in the Transfer Agent Reserve; (l) Borrower effectuates a reverse split of its Common Stock
without twenty (20) Trading Days prior written notice to Lender; (m) any money judgment, writ or similar process is entered or
filed against Borrower or any subsidiary of Borrower or any of its property or other assets for more than $100,000.00, and shall
remain unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of twenty (20) calendar days unless otherwise consented to by Lender; (n) Borrower
fails to be DWAC Eligible; or (o) Borrower breaches any covenant or other term or condition contained in any Other Agreements. 

4.2.          Remedies .
At any time and from time to time after the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender may accelerate this Note by written notice
to Borrower, with the Outstanding Balance becoming immediately due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time following the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender may, at its option, elect to increase the Outstanding
Balance by applying the Default Effect (subject to the limitation set forth below) via written notice to Borrower without accelerating
the Outstanding Balance, in which event the Outstanding Balance shall be increased as of the date of the occurrence of the applicable
Event of Default pursuant to the Default Effect, but the Outstanding Balance shall not be immediately due and payable unless so
declared by Lender (for the avoidance of doubt, if Lender elects to apply the Default Effect pursuant to this sentence, it shall
reserve the right to declare the Outstanding Balance immediately due and payable at any time and no such election by Lender shall
be deemed to be a waiver of its right to declare the Outstanding Balance immediately due and payable as set forth herein unless
otherwise agreed to by Lender in writing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described
in clauses (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of Section 4.1, the Outstanding Balance as of the date of acceleration shall become immediately
and automatically due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount, without any written notice required by Lender. For the
avoidance of doubt, Lender may continue making Conversions at any time following an Event of Default until such time as the Outstanding
Balance is paid in full. Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that Lender may continue making Conversions following the entry
of any judgment or arbitration award in favor of Lender until such time that the entire judgment amount or arbitration award is
paid in full. Borrower agrees that any judgment or arbitration award will, by its terms, be made convertible into Common Stock.
Any Conversions made following a judgment or arbitration award shall be made pursuant to the following formula: the amount of the
judgment or arbitration award being converted divided by 80% of the lowest daily VWAP in the ten (10) Trading Days immediately
preceding the date of Conversion. In such event, Borrower and Lender agree that it is their expectation that any such judgment
amount or arbitration award that is converted will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for purposes of determining the holding
period under Rule 144. Borrower and Lender agree and stipulate that any judgment or arbitration award entered against Borrower
shall be reduced by $1,000.00 and such $1,000.00 shall become the new Outstanding Balance of this Note and this Note shall expressly
survive such judgment or arbitration award. Additionally, following the occurrence of any Event of Default, Borrower may, at its
option, pay any Conversion in cash instead of Conversion Shares by paying to Lender on or before the applicable Delivery Date (as
defined below) a cash amount equal to the number of Conversion Shares set forth in the applicable Conversion Notice multiplied
by the highest daily VWAP of the Common Stock that occurs during the period beginning on the date the applicable Event of Default
occurred and ending on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice. In connection with acceleration described herein, Lender need
not provide, and Borrower hereby waives, any presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, and Lender may immediately
and without expiration of any grace period enforce any and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available
to it under applicable law. Such acceleration may be rescinded and annulled by Lender at any time prior to payment hereunder and
Lender shall have all rights as a holder of the Note until such time, if any, as Lender receives full payment pursuant to this
Section 4.2. No such rescission or annulment shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Nothing herein shall limit Lender s right to pursue any other remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without
limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to Borrower s failure to timely deliver
Conversion Shares upon Conversion of the Notes as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

5.            Unconditional
Obligation; No Offset . Borrower acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of Borrower not subject to offset, deduction or counterclaim of any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has
or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors and assigns, and agrees to make the payments or Conversions called for herein
in accordance with the terms of this Note. 

6.           Waiver .
No waiver of any provision of this Note shall be effective unless it is in the form of a writing signed by the party granting the
waiver. No waiver of any provision or consent to any prohibited action shall constitute a waiver of any other provision or consent
to any other prohibited action, whether or not similar. No waiver or consent shall constitute a continuing waiver or consent or
commit a party to provide a waiver or consent in the future except to the extent specifically set forth in writing. 

7.            Effect
of Certain Events . 

7.1.          Adjustment
Due to Distribution . If Borrower shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to
holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution
to Borrower s stockholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off))
(a   Distribution  ), then Lender shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record
for determining stockholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable
to Lender with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had Lender been the holder of such shares of
Common Stock on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to such Distribution. 

7.2.          Adjustments
for Stock Split . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any references to share numbers or share prices shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction. 

8.            Method
of Conversion Share Delivery . On or before the close of business on the fifth (5 th ) Trading Day following the date
of delivery of a Conversion Notice (the   Delivery Date  ), Borrower shall, provided it is DWAC Eligible at such
time, deliver or cause its transfer agent to deliver the applicable Conversion Shares electronically via DWAC to the account designated
by Lender in the applicable Conversion Notice. If Borrower is not DWAC Eligible, it shall deliver to Lender or its broker (as designated
in the Conversion Notice), via reputable overnight courier, a certificate representing the number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the number of Conversion Shares to which Lender shall be entitled, registered in the name of Lender or its designee. For the
avoidance of doubt, Borrower has not met its obligation to deliver Conversion Shares by the Delivery Date unless Lender or its
broker, as applicable, has actually received the certificate representing the applicable Conversion Shares no later than the close
of business on the relevant Delivery Date pursuant to the terms set forth above. Moreover, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, in the event Borrower or its transfer agent refuses to deliver any Conversion
Shares to Lender on grounds that such issuance is in violation of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Rule
144  ), Borrower shall deliver or cause its transfer agent to deliver the applicable Conversion Shares to Lender with
a restricted securities legend, but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8. In conjunction therewith, Borrower
will also deliver to Lender a written opinion from its counsel or its transfer agent s counsel opining as to why the issuance
of the applicable Conversion Shares violates Rule 144. 

9.            Conversion
Delays . If Borrower fails to deliver Conversion Shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in Section 8, Lender, at any
time prior to selling all of those Conversion Shares, may rescind in whole or in part that particular Conversion attributable to
the unsold Conversion Shares, with a corresponding increase to the Outstanding Balance (the parties  expectation being that
any returned amount will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for purposes of determining the holding period under Rule 144). In
addition, for each Conversion, in the event that Conversion Shares are not delivered by the sixth Trading Day (inclusive of the
day of the Conversion), a late fee equal to the greater of (a) $500.00 and (b) 2% of the applicable Conversion Share Value rounded
to the nearest multiple of $100.00 (but in any event the cumulative amount of such late fees for each Conversion shall not exceed
200% of the applicable Conversion Share Value) will be assessed for each day after the fifth Trading Day (inclusive of the day
of the Conversion) until Conversion Share delivery is made; and such late fee will be added to the Outstanding Balance (such fees,
the   Conversion Delay Late Fees  ). For illustration purposes only, if Lender delivers a Conversion Notice to
Borrower pursuant to which Borrower is required to deliver 100,000 Conversion Shares to Lender and on the Delivery Date such Conversion
Shares have a Conversion Share Value of $20,000.00, then in such event a Conversion Delay Late Fee in the amount of $500.00 per
day (the greater of $500.00 per day and $20,000.00 multiplied by 2%, which is $400.00) would be added to the Outstanding Balance
of the Note until such Conversion Shares are delivered to Lender. For purposes of this example, if the Conversion Shares are delivered
to Lender twenty (20) days after the applicable Delivery Date, the total Conversion Delay Late Fees that would be added to the
Outstanding Balance would be $10,000.00 (20 days multiplied by $500.00 per day). If the Conversion Shares are delivered to Lender
one hundred (100) days after the applicable Delivery Date, the total Conversion Delay Late Fees that would be added to the Outstanding
Balance would be $40,000.00 (100 days multiplied by $500.00 per day, but capped at 200% of the Conversion Share Value). 

10.           Ownership
Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or the other Transaction Documents, if at any time
Lender shall or would be issued shares of Common Stock under any of the Transaction Documents, but such issuance would cause Lender
(together with its affiliates) to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding 4.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
on such date (including for such purpose the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such issuance) (the   Maximum Percentage  ),
then Borrower must not issue to Lender shares of Common Stock which would exceed the Maximum Percentage. For purposes of this section,
beneficial ownership of Common Stock will be determined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. The shares of Common Stock issuable
to Lender that would cause the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are referred to herein as the   Ownership Limitation Shares  .
Borrower will reserve the Ownership Limitation Shares for the exclusive benefit of Lender. From time to time, Lender may notify
Borrower in writing of the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares that may be issued to Lender without causing Lender to exceed
the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue such designated
shares to Lender, with a corresponding reduction in the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
the term  4.99%  above shall be replaced with  9.99%  at such time as the Market Capitalization is less
than $10,000,000.00. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, if the term  4.99%  is replaced with  9.99% 
pursuant to the preceding sentence, such increase to  9.99%  shall remain at 9.99% until increased, decreased or waived
by Lender as set forth below. By written notice to Borrower, Lender may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage as to
itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the 61st day after delivery thereof. The foregoing 61-day notice requirement
is enforceable, unconditional and non-waivable and shall apply to all affiliates and assigns of Lender. 

11.           Payment
of Collection Costs . If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or enforcement prior to commencing arbitration
or legal proceedings, or is collected or enforced through any arbitration or legal proceeding, or Lender otherwise takes action
to collect amounts due under this Note or to enforce the provisions of this Note, then Borrower shall pay the costs incurred by
Lender for such collection, enforcement or action including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and disbursements. Borrower
also agrees to pay for any costs, fees or charges of its transfer agent that are charged to Lender pursuant to any Conversion or
issuance of shares pursuant to this Note. 

12.           Opinion
of Counsel . In the event that an opinion of counsel is needed for any matter related to this Note, Lender has the right to
have any such opinion provided by its counsel. Lender also has the right to have any such opinion provided by Borrower s
counsel. 

13.          Governing
Law; Venue . This Note shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and performance of this Note shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of Utah, without giving effect
to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Utah or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Utah. The provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement
to determine the proper venue for any disputes are incorporated herein by this reference. 

14.           Resolution
of Disputes . 

14.1.        Arbitration
of Disputes . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by the Arbitration Provisions (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) set forth as an exhibit to the Purchase Agreement. 

14.2.        Calculation
Disputes . Notwithstanding the Arbitration Provisions, in the case of a dispute as to any Calculation (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement), such dispute will be resolved in the manner set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 

15.          Cancellation .
After repayment or conversion of the entire Outstanding Balance, this Note shall be deemed paid in full, shall automatically be
deemed canceled, and shall not be reissued. 

16.          Amendments .
The prior written consent of both parties hereto shall be required for any change or amendment to this Note. 

17.          Assignments .
Borrower may not assign this Note without the prior written consent of Lender. This Note and any shares of Common Stock issued
upon conversion of this Note may be offered, sold, assigned or transferred by Lender without the consent of Borrower. 

18.          Time
is of the Essence . Time is expressly made of the essence with respect to each and every provision of this Note and the documents
and instruments entered into in connection herewith. 

19.          Notices .
Whenever notice is required to be given under this Note, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall be given in accordance
with the subsection of the Purchase Agreement titled  Notices.  

20.          Liquidated
Damages . Lender and Borrower agree that in the event Borrower fails to comply with any of the terms or provisions of this Note,
Lender s damages would be uncertain and difficult (if not impossible) to accurately estimate because of the parties 
inability to predict future interest rates, future share prices, future trading volumes and other relevant factors. Accordingly,
Lender and Borrower agree that any fees, balance adjustments, or other charges assessed under this Note are not penalties but instead
are intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, liquidated damages (under Lender s and Borrower s expectations
that any such liquidated damages will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for purposes of determining the holding period under
Rule 144). 

21.          Waiver
of Jury Trial . EACH OF LENDER AND BORROWER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO DEMAND THAT ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS NOTE OR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PARTIES HERETO BE TRIED
BY JURY. THIS WAIVER EXTENDS TO ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY ARISING UNDER COMMON LAW OR ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE,
LAW, RULE OR REGULATION. FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING SUCH PARTY S
RIGHT TO DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY. 

22.          Voluntary
Agreement . Borrower has carefully read this Note and has asked any questions needed for Borrower to understand the terms, consequences
and binding effect of this Note and fully understand them. Borrower has had the opportunity to seek the advice of an attorney of
Borrower s choosing, or has waived the right to do so, and is executing this Note voluntarily and without any duress or undue
influence by Lender or anyone else. 

23.          Severability .
If any part of this Note is construed to be in violation of any law, such part shall be modified to achieve the objective of Borrower
and Lender to the fullest extent permitted by law and the balance of this Note shall remain in full force and effect. 

24.          Par
Value Adjustments . If at any time Lender delivers a Conversion Notice to Borrower and as of such date the Conversion Price
would be less than the Par Value, then, as liquidated damages, Company must pay to Lender the Par Value Adjustment Amount in cash
within one (1) Trading Day of delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice (a   Par Value Adjustment  ). If Borrower
does not deliver the Par Value Adjustment Amount as required, then such amount shall automatically be added to the Outstanding
Balance. The number of Conversion Shares deliverable pursuant to any relevant Conversion Notice following a Par Value Adjustment
shall be equal to (a) the Conversion Amount, divided by (b) the Par Value. In the event of a Par Value Adjustment, Lender will
use a Conversion Notice in substantially the form attached hereto as  Exhibit B .

obligations.  

4.        Company
Covenants . Until all of Company s obligations under all of the Transaction Documents are paid and performed in full
or otherwise satisfied, or within the timeframes otherwise specifically set forth below, Company will at all times comply with
the following covenants: (i) so long as Investor beneficially owns any of the Securities and for at least twenty (20) Trading
Days thereafter, Company will timely file on the applicable deadline or applicable extension thereof all reports required to be
filed with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act, and will take all reasonable action under its control to
ensure that adequate current public information with respect to Company, as required in accordance with Rule 144 of the 1933 Act,
is publicly available, and will not terminate its status as an issuer required to file reports under the 1934 Act even if the
1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would permit such termination; (ii) the Common Stock shall be listed or quoted
for trading on any of (a) NYSE, (b) NASDAQ, (c) OTCQX, or (d) OTCQB; (iii) when issued, the Conversion Shares will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid for and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances other than any
encumbrance or impediment that may be caused by or related to a restrictive legend appearing on any stock certificate representing
Conversion Shares as a result of a 144 Event; (iv) trading in Company s Common Stock will not be suspended, halted, chilled,
frozen, or otherwise cease on Company s principal trading market; (v) Company will not have at any given time after the
Closing more than two (2) Variable Security Holders (as defined below), excluding Investor, without Investor s prior written
consent, which consent may be granted or withheld in Investor s sole and absolute discretion; (vi) at Closing and on any
other date during which the Note is outstanding, as may be requested in writing by Investor, Company shall cause its Chief Executive
Officer to provide to Investor a certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as  Exhibit B  (the   Officer s
Certificate  ) certifying in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of Company the number of Variable Security Holders
of Company as of the date the applicable Officer s Certificate is executed; and (vii) if at any time the Common Stock trades
below $0.005, Company shall, as soon as practicable but in no event longer than sixty (60) days thereafter, reduce the par value
of its Common Stock to $0.00001 or below. For purposes hereof, the term   Variable Security Holder   means any
holder of any Company securities that (A) have or may have conversion rights of any kind, contingent, conditional or otherwise,
in which the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to such conversion right varies with the market price of the Common
Stock, or (B) are or may become convertible into Common Stock (including without limitation convertible debt, warrants or convertible
preferred stock), with a conversion price that varies with the market price of the Common Stock, even if such security only becomes
convertible following an event of default, the passage of time, or another trigger event or condition (each a   Variable
Security Issuance  ). For avoidance of doubt, the issuance of shares of Common Stock under, pursuant to, in exchange
for or in connection with any contract or instrument, whether convertible or not, is deemed a Variable Security Issuance for purposes
hereof if the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued is based upon or related in any way to the market price of the Common
Stock, including, but not limited to, Common Stock issued in connection with a Section 3(a)(9) exchange, a Section 3(a)(10) settlement,
or any other similar settlement or exchange.  

5.        Conditions
to Company s Obligation to Sell . The obligation of Company hereunder to issue and sell the Note to Investor at the Closing
is subject to the satisfaction, on or before the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:  

5.1.       Investor
shall have executed this Agreement and delivered the same to Company.  

5.2.       Investor
shall have delivered the Purchase Price to Company in accordance with Section 1.2 above.  

6.        Conditions
to Investor s Obligation to Purchase . The obligation of Investor hereunder to purchase the Note at the Closing is subject
to the satisfaction, on or before the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions, provided that these conditions are for
Investor s sole benefit and may be waived by Investor at any time in its sole discretion:  

6.1.       Company
shall have executed this Agreement and the Note and delivered the same to Investor.  

6.2.       Company s
Chief Executive Officer shall have executed the Officer s Certificate and delivered the same to Investor.  

6.3.       Company
shall have delivered to Investor a fully executed Irrevocable Letter of Instructions to Transfer Agent (the   TA Letter  )
substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit C  acknowledged and agreed to in writing by Company s transfer
agent (the   Transfer Agent  ).  

6.4.       Company
shall have delivered to Investor a fully executed Secretary s Certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit
D  evidencing Company s approval of the Transaction Documents.  

6.5.       Company
shall have delivered to Investor a fully executed Share Issuance Resolution substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit
E  to be delivered to the Transfer Agent.  

6.6.       
Company shall have delivered to Investor fully executed copies of all other Transaction Documents required to be executed by Company
herein or therein.  

7.        Reservation
of Shares . On the date hereof, Company will reserve 1,100,000 shares of Common Stock from its authorized and unissued Common
Stock to provide for all issuances of Common Stock under the Note (the   Transfer Agent Reserve  ). Company further
agrees to add additional shares of Common Stock to the Transfer Agent Reserve in increments of 300,000 shares as and when requested
by Investor if as of the date of any such request the number of shares being held in the Transfer Agent Reserve is less than three
(3) times the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the Outstanding Balance as of the date of the request by the
Conversion Price. Company shall further require the Transfer Agent to hold the shares of Common Stock reserved pursuant to the
Transfer Agent Reserve exclusively for the benefit of Investor and to issue such shares to Investor promptly upon Investor s
delivery of a Conversion Notice under the Note. Finally, Company shall require the Transfer Agent to issue shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the Note to Investor out of its authorized and unissued shares, and not the Transfer Agent Reserve, to the extent
shares of Common Stock have been authorized, but not issued, and are not included in the Transfer Agent Reserve. The Transfer
Agent shall only issue shares out of the Transfer Agent Reserve to the extent there are no other authorized shares available for
issuance and then only with Investor s written consent.  

8.        Terms
of Future Financings . So long as the Note is outstanding, upon any issuance after the Closing by Company of any security other
than securities issued pursuant to the securities identified in  Exhibit G  and  Exhibit H  hereto (the   Excluded
Securities  ) with any term or condition more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the
holder of such security that was not similarly provided to Investor in the Transaction Documents, then Company shall notify Investor
of such additional or more favorable term and such term, at Investor s option, shall become a part of the Transaction Documents
for the benefit of Investor. Additionally, if, other than the Excluded Securities, Company fails to notify Investor of any such
additional or more favorable term, but Investor becomes aware that Company has granted such a term to any third party, Investor
may notify Company of such additional or more favorable term and, provided such additional or more favorable term has in fact
been granted to any such third party other than with respect to the Excluded Securities, then such term shall become a part of
the Transaction Documents retroactive to the date on which such term was granted to the applicable third party. The types of terms
contained in another security issued after the Closing other than the Excluded Securities that may be more favorable to the holder
of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion discounts, conversion lookback periods, interest
rates, original issue discounts, stock sale price, conversion price per share, warrant coverage, warrant exercise price, and anti-dilution/conversion
and exercise price resets.  

9.        Miscellaneous .
The provisions set forth in this Section 9 shall apply to this Agreement, as well as all other Transaction Documents as if these
terms were fully set forth therein; provided, however, that in the event there is a conflict between any provision set forth in
this Section 9 and any provision in any other Transaction Document, the provision in such other Transaction Document shall govern.  

9.1.        Certain
Capitalized Terms . To the extent any capitalized term used in any Transaction Document is defined in any other Transaction
Document (as noted therein), such capitalized term shall remain applicable in the Transaction Document in which it is so used
even if the other Transaction Document (wherein such term is defined) has been released, satisfied, or is otherwise cancelled
or terminated.  

9.2.        Arbitration
of Claims . The parties shall submit all Claims (as defined in  Exhibit F ) arising under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement between the parties and their affiliates or any Claim relating to the relationship
of the parties to binding arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions set forth in  Exhibit F  attached hereto (the
  Arbitration Provisions  ). The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Arbitration Provisions are unconditionally
binding on the parties hereto and are severable from all other provisions of this Agreement. By executing this Agreement, Company
represents, warrants and covenants that Company has reviewed the Arbitration Provisions carefully, consulted with legal counsel
about such provisions (or waived its right to do so), understands that the Arbitration Provisions are intended to allow for the
expeditious and efficient resolution of any dispute hereunder, agrees to the terms and limitations set forth in the Arbitration
Provisions, and that Company will not take a position contrary to the foregoing representations. Company acknowledges and agrees
that Investor may rely upon the foregoing representations and covenants of Company regarding the Arbitration Provisions.  

9.3.        Governing
Law; Venue . This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of Utah, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Utah or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Utah. Each party consents to and expressly
agrees that exclusive venue for arbitration of any dispute arising out of or relating to any Transaction Document or the relationship
of the parties or their affiliates shall be in Salt Lake County, Utah. Without modifying the parties obligations to resolve disputes
hereunder pursuant to the Arbitration Provisions, for any litigation arising in connection with any of the Transaction Documents
(and notwithstanding the terms (specifically including any governing law and venue terms) of any transfer agent services agreement
or other agreement between the Transfer Agent and Company, if such litigation specifically includes, without limitation any action
between or involving Company and the Transfer Agent under the TA Letter or otherwise related to Investor in any way (specifically
including, without limitation, any action where Company seeks to obtain an injunction, temporary restraining order, or otherwise
prohibit the Transfer Agent from issuing shares of Common Stock to Investor for any reason)), each party hereto hereby (i) consents
to and expressly submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah,
(ii) expressly submits to the exclusive venue of any such court for the purposes hereof, (iii) agrees to not bring any such action
(specifically including, without limitation, any action where Company seeks to obtain an injunction, temporary restraining order,
or otherwise prohibit the Transfer Agent from issuing shares of Common Stock to Investor for any reason) outside of any state
or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah, and (iv) waives any claim of improper venue and any claim or objection that
such courts are an inconvenient forum or any other claim, defense or objection to the bringing of any such proceeding in such
jurisdiction or to any claim that such venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper. Finally, Company covenants and agrees
to name Investor as a party in interest in, and provide written notice to Investor in accordance with Section 9.13 below prior
to bringing or filing, any action (including without limitation any filing or action against any person or entity that is not
a party to this Agreement, including without limitation the Transfer Agent) that is related in any way to the Transaction Documents
or any transaction contemplated herein or therein, including without limitation any action brought by Company to enjoin or prevent
the issuance of any shares of Common Stock to Investor by the Transfer Agent, and further agrees to timely name Investor as a
party to any such action. Company acknowledges that the governing law and venue provisions set forth in this Section 9.3 are material
terms to induce Investor to enter into the Transaction Documents and that but for Company s agreements set forth in this
Section 9.3 Investor would not have entered into the Transaction Documents.  

9.4.        Specific
Performance . Company acknowledges and agrees that irreparable damage may occur to Investor in the event that Company fails
to perform any material provision of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents in accordance with its specific
terms. It is accordingly agreed that Investor shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or cure breaches of
any such material provision of this Agreement or such other Transaction Document and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof or thereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the Investor may be entitled under the Transaction Documents,
at law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Investor seeks to obtain an injunction against Company or specific
performance of any provision of any Transaction Document, such action shall not be a waiver of any right of Investor under any
Transaction Document, at law, or in equity, including without limitation its rights to arbitrate any Claim pursuant to the terms
of the Transaction Documents.  

9.5.        Calculation
Disputes . Notwithstanding the Arbitration Provisions, in the case of a dispute as to any determination or arithmetic calculation
under the Transaction Documents, including without limitation, calculating the Outstanding Balance, Conversion Price, Conversion
Shares, or VWAP (each, a   Calculation  ), Company or Investor (as the case may be) shall submit any disputed
Calculation via email or facsimile with confirmation of receipt (i) within two (2) Trading Days after receipt by Company or Investor
(as the case may be) of the applicable notice giving rise to such dispute or (ii) if no notice gave rise to such dispute, at any
time after Investor or Company (as the case may be) learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute. If Investor and
Company are unable to agree upon such Calculation within two (2) Trading Days of such disputed Calculation being submitted to
Company or Investor (as the case may be), then Investor will promptly submit via email or facsimile the disputed Calculation to
Unkar Systems Inc. (  Unkar Systems  ). Investor shall cause Unkar Systems to perform the Calculation and notify
Company and Investor of the results no later than ten (10) Trading Days from the time it receives such disputed Calculation. Unkar
Systems  determination of the disputed Calculation shall be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error. Unkar Systems 
fee for performing such Calculation shall be paid by the incorrect party, or if both parties are incorrect, by the party whose
Calculation is furthest from the correct Calculation as determined by Unkar Systems. In the event Company is the losing party,
no extension of the Delivery Date shall be granted and Company shall incur all effects for failing to deliver the applicable shares
in a timely manner as set forth in the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Investor and Company may jointly
designate an independent, reputable investment bank or accounting firm other than Unkar Systems to resolve any such dispute and
in such event, all references to  Unkar Systems  herein will be replaced with references to such independent, reputable
investment bank or accounting firm so jointly designated by Investor and Company.  

9.6.        Counterparts .
Each Transaction Document may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one instrument. The parties hereto confirm that any electronic copy of another party s executed
counterpart of a Transaction Document (or such party s signature page thereof) will be deemed to be an executed original
thereof.  

9.7.        Document
Imaging . Investor shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to image or make copies of all or any selection of the agreements,
instruments, documents, and items and records governing, arising from or relating to any of Company s loans, including,
without limitation, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and Investor may destroy or archive the paper originals.
The parties hereto (i) waive any right to insist or require that Investor produce paper originals, (ii) agree that such images
shall be accorded the same force and effect as the paper originals, (iii) agree that Investor is entitled to use such images in
lieu of destroyed or archived originals for any purpose, including as admissible evidence in any demand, presentment or other
proceedings, and (iv) further agree that any executed facsimile (faxed), scanned, emailed, or other imaged copy of this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document shall be deemed to be of the same force and effect as the original manually executed document.  

9.8.        Headings .
The headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation
of, this Agreement.  

9.9.        Severability .
In the event that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then
such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform
to such statute or rule of law. Any provision hereof which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof.  

9.10.      Entire
Agreement . This Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents, contains the entire understanding of the parties
with respect to the matters covered herein and therein and, except as specifically set forth herein or therein, neither Company
nor Investor makes any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking with respect to such matters. For the avoidance of doubt,
all prior term sheets or other documents between Company and Investor, or any affiliate thereof, related to the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents (collectively,   Prior Agreements  ), that may have been entered into between Company
and Investor, or any affiliate thereof, are hereby null and void and deemed to be replaced in their entirety by the Transaction
Documents. To the extent there is a conflict between any term set forth in any Prior Agreement and the term(s) of the Transaction
Documents, the Transaction Documents shall govern.  

9.11.      No
Reliance . Company acknowledges and agrees that neither Investor nor any of its officers, directors, members, managers, representatives
or agents has made any representations or warranties to Company or any of its officers, directors, representatives, agents or
employees except as expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents and, in making its decision to enter into the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, Company is not relying on any representation, warranty, covenant or promise of Investor
or its officers, directors, members, managers, agents or representatives other than as set forth in the Transaction Documents.  

9.12.      Amendments .
No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended other than by an instrument in writing signed by both parties hereto.  

9.13.      Notices .
Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing (unless otherwise specified herein) and shall be deemed effectively
given on the earliest of: (i) the date delivered, if delivered by personal delivery as against written receipt therefor or by
email to an executive officer, or by facsimile (with successful transmission confirmation), (ii) the earlier of the date delivered
or the third Trading Day after deposit, postage prepaid, in the United States Postal Service by certified mail, or (iii) the earlier

9.14.      Successors
and Assigns . This Agreement or any of the severable rights and obligations inuring to the benefit of or to be performed by
Investor hereunder may be assigned by Investor to a third party, including its affiliates, in whole or in part, without the need
to obtain Company s consent thereto. Company may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement or delegate its
duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Investor.  

9.15.      Survival .
The representations and warranties of Company and the agreements and covenants set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
hereunder notwithstanding any due diligence investigation conducted by or on behalf of Investor. Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless Investor and all its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, and agents for loss or damage arising as a result
of or related to any breach or alleged breach by Company of any of its representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
this Agreement or any of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement, including advancement of expenses as they are incurred.  

9.16.      Further
Assurances . Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall
execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as the other party may reasonably request
in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.  

9.17.      Investor s
Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Liquidated Damages . All rights, remedies, and powers conferred in this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies, and shall be in addition to every other right, power,
and remedy that Investor may have, whether specifically granted in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or existing
at law, in equity, or by statute, and any and all such rights and remedies may be exercised from time to time and as often and
in such order as Investor may deem expedient. The parties acknowledge and agree that upon Company s failure to comply with
the provisions of the Transaction Documents, Investor s damages would be uncertain and difficult (if not impossible) to
accurately estimate because of the parties  inability to predict future interest rates and future share prices, Investor s
increased risk, and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for Investor, among other
reasons. Accordingly, any fees, charges, and default interest due under the Note and the other Transaction Documents are intended
by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, liquidated damages (under Company s and Investor s expectations that any
such liquidated damages will tack back to the Closing Date for purposes of determining the holding period under Rule 144 under
the 1933 Act). The parties agree that such liquidated damages are a reasonable estimate of Investor s actual damages and
not a penalty, and shall not be deemed in any way to limit any other right or remedy Investor may have hereunder, at law or in
equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that under the circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is entered into, such
liquidated damages are fair and reasonable and are not penalties. All fees, charges, and default interest provided for in the
Transaction Documents are agreed to by the parties to be based upon the obligations and the risks assumed by the parties as of
the Closing Date and are consistent with investments of this type. The liquidated damages provisions of the Transaction Documents
shall not limit or preclude a party from pursuing any other remedy available at law or in equity;  provided, however , that
the liquidated damages provided for in the Transaction Documents are intended to be in lieu of actual damages.  

9.18.      Ownership
Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, if at
any time Investor would be issued shares of Common Stock under any of the Transaction Documents, but such issuance would cause
Investor (together with its affiliates) to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then Company
must not issue to Investor the shares that would cause Investor to exceed the Maximum Percentage. The shares of Common Stock issuable
to Investor that would cause the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are referred to herein as the   Ownership Limitation
Shares  . Company shall reserve the Ownership Limitation Shares for the exclusive benefit of Investor. From time to time,
Investor may notify Company in writing of the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares that may be issued to Investor without
causing Investor to exceed the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice, Company shall be unconditionally obligated to
immediately issue such designated shares to Investor, with a corresponding reduction in the number of the Ownership Limitation
Shares. For purposes of this Section, beneficial ownership of Common Stock will be determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934
Act.  

9.19.      Attorneys 
Fees and Cost of Collection . In the event of any arbitration or action at law or in equity to enforce or interpret the terms
of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, the parties agree that the party who is awarded the most money (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any statutory fines, penalties, fees, or other charges awarded
to any party) shall be deemed the prevailing party for all purposes and shall therefore be entitled to an additional award of
the full amount of the attorneys  fees, deposition costs, and expenses paid by such prevailing party in connection with
arbitration or litigation without reduction or apportionment based upon the individual claims or defenses giving rise to the fees
and expenses. Nothing herein shall restrict or impair an arbitrator s or a court s power to award fees and expenses
for frivolous or bad faith pleading. If (i) the Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or enforcement prior
to commencing arbitration or legal proceedings, or is collected or enforced through any arbitration or legal proceeding, or Investor
otherwise takes action to collect amounts due under the Note or to enforce the provisions of the Note, or (ii) there occurs any
bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership of Company or other proceedings affecting Company s creditors  rights and
involving a claim under the Note; then Company shall pay the costs incurred by Investor for such collection, enforcement or action
or in connection with such bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or other proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys 
fees, expenses, deposition costs, and disbursements.  

9.20.      Waiver .
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in the form of a writing signed by the party granting
the waiver. No waiver of any provision or consent to any prohibited action shall constitute a waiver of any other provision or
consent to any other prohibited action, whether or not similar. No waiver or consent shall constitute a continuing waiver or consent
or commit a party to provide a waiver or consent in the future except to the extent specifically set forth in writing.  

9.21.      Waiver
of Jury Trial . EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO DEMAND THAT ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, OR THE RELATIONSHIPS
OF THE PARTIES HERETO BE TRIED BY JURY. THIS WAIVER EXTENDS TO ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY ARISING UNDER COMMON
LAW OR ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE, LAW, RULE OR REGULATION. FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY IS KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVING SUCH PARTY S RIGHT TO DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY.  

9.22.      Time
is of the Essence . Time is expressly made of the essence with respect to each and every provision of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.  

9.23.      Voluntary
Agreement . Company has carefully read this Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents and has asked any questions
needed for Company to understand the terms, consequences and binding effect of this Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Documents and fully understand them. Company has had the opportunity to seek the advice of an attorney of Company s choosing,
or has waived the right to do so, and is executing this Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents voluntarily and
without any duress or undue influence by Investor or anyone else.

ARBITRATION PROVISIONS  

1.        Dispute
Resolution . For purposes of this  Exhibit F , the term   Claims   means any disputes, claims, demands,
causes of action, requests for injunctive relief, requests for specific performance, liabilities, damages, losses, or controversies
whatsoever arising from, related to, or connected with the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents and any communications
between the parties related thereto, including without limitation any claims of mutual mistake, mistake, fraud, misrepresentation,
failure of formation, failure of consideration, promissory estoppel, unconscionability, failure of condition precedent, rescission,
and any statutory claims, tort claims, contract claims, or claims to void, invalidate or terminate the Agreement (or these Arbitration
Provisions (defined below)) or any of the other Transaction Documents. The term  Claims  specifically excludes a dispute
over Calculations. The parties to the Agreement (the   parties  ) hereby agree that the arbitration provisions
set forth in this  Exhibit F  (  Arbitration Provisions  ) are binding on each of them. As a result, any
attempt to rescind the Agreement (or these Arbitration Provisions) or declare the Agreement (or these Arbitration Provisions) or
any other Transaction Document invalid or unenforceable for any reason is subject to these Arbitration Provisions. These Arbitration
Provisions shall also survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement. Any capitalized term not defined in these Arbitration
Provisions shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement. 

2.        Arbitration .
Except as otherwise provided herein, all Claims must be submitted to arbitration (  Arbitration  ) to be conducted
exclusively in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah and pursuant to the terms set forth in these Arbitration Provisions. Subject
to the arbitration appeal right provided for in Paragraph 5 below (the   Appeal Right  ), the parties agree that
the award of the arbitrator rendered pursuant to Paragraph 4 below (the   Arbitration Award  ) shall be (a) final
and binding upon the parties, (b) the sole and exclusive remedy between them regarding any Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings
presented or pleaded to the arbitrator, and (c) promptly payable in United States dollars free of any tax, deduction or offset
(with respect to monetary awards). Subject to the Appeal Right, any costs or fees, including without limitation attorneys 
fees, incurred in connection with or incident to enforcing the Arbitration Award shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
be charged against the party resisting such enforcement. The Arbitration Award shall include default interest (as defined or otherwise
provided for in the Note,   Default Interest  ) (with respect to monetary awards) at the rate specified in the
Note for Default Interest both before and after the Arbitration Award. Judgment upon the Arbitration Award will be entered and
enforced by any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah. 

3.        The
Arbitration Act . The parties hereby incorporate herein the provisions and procedures set forth in the Utah Uniform Arbitration
Act, U.C.A.   78B-11-101  et seq.  (as amended or superseded from time to time, the   Arbitration Act  ).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to, and to the maximum extent permitted by, Section 105 of the Arbitration Act, in the
event of conflict or variation between the terms of these Arbitration Provisions and the provisions of the Arbitration Act, the
terms of these Arbitration Provisions shall control and the parties hereby waive or otherwise agree to vary the effect of all requirements
of the Arbitration Act that may conflict with or vary from these Arbitration Provisions. 

4.        Arbitration
Proceedings . Arbitration between the parties will be subject to the following: 

4.1        Initiation
of Arbitration . Pursuant to Section 110 of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that a party may initiate Arbitration by
giving written notice to the other party (  Arbitration Notice  ) in the same manner that notice is permitted
under Section 9.13 of the Agreement;  provided, however , that the Arbitration Notice may not be given by email or fax. Arbitration
will be deemed initiated as of the date that the Arbitration Notice is deemed delivered to such other party under Section 9.13
of the Agreement (the   Service Date  ). After the Service Date, information may be delivered, and notices may
be given, by email or fax pursuant to Section 9.13 of the Agreement or any other method permitted thereunder. The Arbitration Notice
must describe the nature of the controversy, the remedies sought, and the election to commence Arbitration proceedings. All Claims
in the Arbitration Notice must be pleaded consistent with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Arbitration Provisions  , Page   1  

4.2        Selection
and Payment of Arbitrator . 

(a) Within ten (10) calendar
days after the Service Date, Investor shall select and submit to Company the names of three (3) arbitrators that are designated
as  neutrals  or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Services ( http://www.utahadrservices.com ) (such three (3)
designated persons hereunder are referred to herein as the   Proposed Arbitrators  ). For the avoidance of doubt,
each Proposed Arbitrator must be qualified as a  neutral  with Utah ADR Services. Within five (5) calendar days after
Investor has submitted to Company the names of the Proposed Arbitrators, Company must select, by written notice to Investor, one
(1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator for the parties under these Arbitration Provisions. If Company fails
to select one of the Proposed Arbitrators in writing within such 5-day period, then Investor may select the arbitrator from the
Proposed Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to Company. 

(b) If Investor fails
to submit to Company the Proposed Arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days after the Service Date pursuant to subparagraph (a)
above, then Company may at any time prior to Investor so designating the Proposed Arbitrators, identify the names of three (3)
arbitrators that are designated as  neutrals  or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Service by written notice to Investor.
Investor may then, within five (5) calendar days after Company has submitted notice of its Proposed Arbitrators to Investor, select,
by written notice to Company, one (1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator for the parties under these Arbitration
Provisions. If Investor fails to select in writing and within such 5-day period one (1) of the three (3) Proposed Arbitrators selected
by Company, then Company may select the arbitrator from its three (3) previously selected Proposed Arbitrators by providing written
notice of such selection to Investor. 

(c) If a Proposed Arbitrator
chosen to serve as arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve as arbitrator, then the party that selected such Proposed
Arbitrator may select one (1) of the other three (3) Proposed Arbitrators within three (3) calendar days of the date the chosen
Proposed Arbitrator declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as arbitrator. If all three (3) Proposed Arbitrators
decline or are otherwise unable to serve as arbitrator, then the arbitrator selection process shall begin again in accordance with
this Paragraph 4.2. 

(d) The date that the
Proposed Arbitrator selected pursuant to this Paragraph 4.2 agrees in writing (including via email) delivered to both parties to
serve as the arbitrator hereunder is referred to herein as the   Arbitration Commencement Date  . If an arbitrator
resigns or is unable to act during the Arbitration, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with this Paragraph
4.2 to continue the Arbitration. If Utah ADR Services ceases to exist or to provide a list of neutrals and there is no successor
thereto, then the arbitrator shall be selected under the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association. 

(e) Subject to Paragraph
4.10 below, the cost of the arbitrator must be paid equally by both parties. Subject to Paragraph 4.10 below, if one party refuses
or fails to pay its portion of the arbitrator fee, then the other party can advance such unpaid amount (subject to the accrual
of Default Interest thereupon), with such amount being added to or subtracted from, as applicable, the Arbitration Award. 

4.3        Applicability
of Certain Utah Rules . The parties agree that the Arbitration shall be conducted generally in accordance with the Utah Rules
of Civil Procedure and the Utah Rules of Evidence. More specifically, the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply, without limitation,
to the filing of any pleadings, motions or memoranda, the conducting of discovery, and the taking of any depositions. The Utah
Rules of Evidence shall apply to any hearings, whether telephonic or in person, held by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is the parties  intent that the incorporation of such rules will in no event supersede these Arbitration Provisions. In
the event of any conflict between the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure or the Utah Rules of Evidence and these Arbitration Provisions,
these Arbitration Provisions shall control. 

4.4        Answer
and Default . An answer and any counterclaims to the Arbitration Notice shall be required to be delivered to the party initiating
the Arbitration within twenty (20) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date. If an answer is not delivered by the
required deadline, the arbitrator must provide written notice to the defaulting party stating that the arbitrator will enter a
default award against such party if such party does not file an answer within five (5) calendar days of receipt of such notice.
If an answer is not filed within the five (5) day extension period, the arbitrator must render a default award, consistent with
the relief requested in the Arbitration Notice, against a party that fails to submit an answer within such time period. 

Arbitration Provisions  , Page   2  

4.5        Related
Litigation . The party that delivers the Arbitration Notice to the other party shall have the option to also commence concurrent
legal proceedings with any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah (  Litigation Proceedings  ),
subject to the following: (a) the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings is to be substantially similar to the claims set forth
in the Arbitration Notice, provided that an additional cause of action to compel arbitration will also be included therein, (b)
so long as the other party files an answer to the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings and an answer to the Arbitration Notice,
the Litigation Proceedings will be stayed pending an Arbitration Award (or Appeal Panel Award (defined below), as applicable) hereunder,
(c) if the other party fails to file an answer in the Litigation Proceedings or an answer in the Arbitration proceedings, then
the party initiating Arbitration shall be entitled to a default judgment consistent with the relief requested, to be entered in
the Litigation Proceedings, and (d) any legal or procedural issue arising under the Arbitration Act that requires a decision of
a court of competent jurisdiction may be determined in the Litigation Proceedings. Any award of the arbitrator (or of the Appeal
Panel (defined below)) may be entered in such Litigation Proceedings pursuant to the Arbitration Act. 

4.6        Discovery .
Pursuant to Section 118(8) of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that discovery shall be conducted as follows: 

(a) Written discovery
will only be allowed if the likely benefits of the proposed written discovery outweigh the burden or expense thereof, and the written
discovery sought is likely to reveal information that will satisfy a specific element of a claim or defense already pleaded in
the Arbitration. The party seeking written discovery shall always have the burden of showing that all of the standards and limitations
set forth in these Arbitration Provisions are satisfied. The scope of discovery in the Arbitration proceedings shall also be limited
as follows: 

(i)    To
facts directly connected with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. 

(ii)   To
facts and information that cannot be obtained from another source or in another manner that is more convenient, less burdensome
or less expensive than in the manner requested. 

(b) No party shall be
allowed (i) more than fifteen (15) interrogatories (including discrete subparts), (ii) more than fifteen (15) requests for admission
(including discrete subparts), (iii) more than ten (10) document requests (including discrete subparts), or (iv) more than three
(3) depositions (excluding expert depositions) for a maximum of seven (7) hours per deposition. The costs associated with depositions
will be borne by the party taking the deposition. The party defending the deposition will submit a notice to the party taking the
deposition of the estimated attorneys  fees that such party expects to incur in connection with defending the deposition.
If the party defending the deposition fails to submit an estimate of attorneys  fees within five (5) calendar days of its
receipt of a deposition notice, then such party shall be deemed to have waived its right to the estimated attorneys  fees.
The party taking the deposition must pay the party defending the deposition the estimated attorneys  fees prior to taking
the deposition, unless such obligation is deemed to be waived as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. If the party
taking the deposition believes that the estimated attorneys  fees are unreasonable, such party may submit the issue to the
arbitrator for a decision. All depositions will be taken in Utah. 

(c) All discovery requests
(including document production requests included in deposition notices) must be submitted in writing to the arbitrator and the
other party. The party submitting the written discovery requests must include with such discovery requests a detailed explanation
of how the proposed discovery requests satisfy the requirements of these Arbitration Provisions and the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.
The receiving party will then be allowed, within five (5) calendar days of receiving the proposed discovery requests, to submit
to the arbitrator an estimate of the attorneys  fees and costs associated with responding to such written discovery requests
and a written challenge to each applicable discovery request. After receipt of an estimate of attorneys  fees and costs and/or
challenge(s) to one or more discovery requests, consistent with subparagraph (c) above, the arbitrator will within three (3) calendar
days make a finding as to the likely attorneys  fees and costs associated with responding to the discovery requests and issue
an order that (i) requires the requesting party to prepay the attorneys  fees and costs associated with responding to the
discovery requests, and (ii) requires the responding party to respond to the discovery requests as limited by the arbitrator within
twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator s finding with respect to such discovery requests. If a party entitled to
submit an estimate of attorneys  fees and costs and/or a challenge to discovery requests fails to do so within such 5-day
period, the arbitrator will make a finding that (A) there are no attorneys  fees or costs associated with responding to such
discovery requests, and (B) the responding party must respond to such discovery requests (as may be limited by the arbitrator)
within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator s finding with respect to such discovery requests. Any party submitting
any written discovery requests, including without limitation interrogatories, requests for production subpoenas to a party or a
third party, or requests for admissions, must prepay the estimated attorneys  fees and costs, before the responding party
has any obligation to produce or respond to the same, unless such obligation is deemed waived as set forth above. 

Arbitration Provisions  , Page   3  

(d) In order to allow
a written discovery request, the arbitrator must find that the discovery request satisfies the standards set forth in these Arbitration
Provisions and the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator must strictly enforce these standards. If a discovery request
does not satisfy any of the standards set forth in these Arbitration Provisions or the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, the arbitrator
may modify such discovery request to satisfy the applicable standards, or strike such discovery request in whole or in part. 

(e) Each party may submit
expert reports (and rebuttals thereto), provided that such reports must be submitted within sixty (60) days of the Arbitration
Commencement Date. Each party will be allowed a maximum of two (2) experts. Expert reports must contain the following: (i) a complete
statement of all opinions the expert will offer at trial and the basis and reasons for them; (ii) the expert s name and qualifications,
including a list of all the expert s publications within the preceding ten (10) years, and a list of any other cases in which
the expert has testified at trial or in a deposition or prepared a report within the preceding ten (10) years; and (iii) the compensation
to be paid for the expert s report and testimony. The parties are entitled to depose any other party s expert witness
one (1) time for no more than four (4) hours. An expert may not testify in a party s case-in-chief concerning any matter
not fairly disclosed in the expert report. 

4.6        Dispositive
Motions . Each party shall have the right to submit dispositive motions pursuant Rule 12 or Rule 56 of the Utah Rules of Civil
Procedure (a   Dispositive Motion  ). The party submitting the Dispositive Motion may, but is not required to,
deliver to the arbitrator and to the other party a memorandum in support (the   Memorandum in Support  ) of the
Dispositive Motion. Within seven (7) calendar days of delivery of the Memorandum in Support, the other party shall deliver to the
arbitrator and to the other party a memorandum in opposition to the Memorandum in Support (the   Memorandum in Opposition  ).
Within seven (7) calendar days of delivery of the Memorandum in Opposition, as applicable, the party that submitted the Memorandum
in Support shall deliver to the arbitrator and to the other party a reply memorandum to the Memorandum in Opposition (  Reply
Memorandum  ). If the applicable party shall fail to deliver the Memorandum in Opposition as required above, or if the
other party fails to deliver the Reply Memorandum as required above, then the applicable party shall lose its right to so deliver
the same, and the Dispositive Motion shall proceed regardless. 

4.7        Confidentiality .
All information disclosed by either party (or such party s agents) during the Arbitration process (including without limitation
information disclosed during the discovery process or any Appeal (defined below)) shall be considered confidential in nature. Each
party agrees not to disclose any confidential information received from the other party (or its agents) during the Arbitration
process (including without limitation during the discovery process or any Appeal) unless (a) prior to or after the time of disclosure
such information becomes public knowledge or part of the public domain, not as a result of any inaction or action of the receiving
party or its agents, (b) such information is required by a court order, subpoena or similar legal duress to be disclosed if such
receiving party has notified the other party thereof in writing and given it a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order
from a court of competent jurisdiction prior to disclosure, or (c) such information is disclosed to the receiving party s
agents, representatives and legal counsel on a need to know basis who each agree in writing not to disclose such information to
any third party. Pursuant to Section 118(5) of the Arbitration Act, the arbitrator is hereby authorized and directed to issue a
protective order to prevent the disclosure of privileged information and confidential information upon the written request of either
party. 

4.8        Authorization;
Timing; Scheduling Order . Subject to all other portions of these Arbitration Provisions, the parties hereby authorize and direct
the arbitrator to take such actions and make such rulings as may be necessary to carry out the parties  intent for the Arbitration
proceedings to be efficient and expeditious. Pursuant to Section 120 of the Arbitration Act, the parties hereby agree that an Arbitration
Award must be made within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date. The arbitrator is hereby
authorized and directed to hold a scheduling conference within ten (10) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date in
order to establish a scheduling order with various binding deadlines for discovery, expert testimony, and the submission of documents
by the parties to enable the arbitrator to render a decision prior to the end of such 120-day period. 

Arbitration Provisions  , Page   4  

4.9        Relief .
The arbitrator shall have the right to award or include in the Arbitration Award (or in a preliminary ruling) any relief which
the arbitrator deems proper under the circumstances, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive relief,
provided that the arbitrator may not award exemplary or punitive damages. 

4.10        Fees
and Costs . As part of the Arbitration Award, the arbitrator is hereby directed to require the losing party (the party being
awarded the least amount of money by the arbitrator, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any
statutory fines, penalties, fees, or other charges awarded to any party) to (a) pay the full amount of any unpaid costs and fees
of the Arbitration, and (b) reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable attorneys  fees, arbitrator costs and fees,
deposition costs, other discovery costs, and other expenses, costs or fees paid or otherwise incurred by the prevailing party in
connection with the Arbitration. 

5.        Arbitration
Appeal . 

5.1        Initiation
of Appeal.  Following the entry of the Arbitration Award, either party (the   Appellant  ) shall have a period
of thirty (30) calendar days in which to notify the other party (the   Appellee  ), in writing, that the Appellant
elects to appeal (the   Appeal  ) the Arbitration Award (such notice, an   Appeal Notice  ) to
a panel of arbitrators as provided in Paragraph 5.2 below. The date the Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee is
referred to herein as the   Appeal Date  . The Appeal Notice must be delivered to the Appellee in accordance with
the provisions of Paragraph 4.1 above with respect to delivery of an Arbitration Notice. In addition, together with delivery of
the Appeal Notice to the Appellee, the Appellant must also pay for (and provide proof of such payment to the Appellee together
with delivery of the Appeal Notice) a bond in the amount of 110% of the sum the Appellant owes to the Appellee as a result of the
Arbitration Award the Appellant is appealing. In the event an Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee (together with
proof of payment of the applicable bond) in compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1, the Appeal will occur as a matter
of right and, except as specifically set forth herein, will not be further conditioned. In the event a party does not deliver an
Appeal Notice (along with proof of payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline prescribed in this Paragraph
5.1, such party shall lose its right to appeal the Arbitration Award. If no party delivers an Appeal Notice (along with proof of
payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline described in this Paragraph 5.1, the Arbitration Award shall
be final. The parties acknowledge and agree that any Appeal shall be deemed part of the parties  agreement to arbitrate for
purposes of these Arbitration Provisions and the Arbitration Act. 

5.2        Selection
and Payment of Appeal Panel.  In the event an Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee (together with proof of payment
of the applicable bond) in compliance with the provisions of Paragraph 5.1 above, the Appeal will be heard by a three (3) person
arbitration panel (the   Appeal Panel  ). 

(a)  Within ten
(10) calendar days after the Appeal Date, the Appellee shall select and submit to the Appellant the names of five (5) arbitrators
that are designated as  neutrals  or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Services ( http://www.utahadrservices.com )
(such five (5) designated persons hereunder are referred to herein as the   Proposed Appeal Arbitrators  ). For
the avoidance of doubt, each Proposed Appeal Arbitrator must be qualified as a  neutral  with Utah ADR Services, and
shall not be the arbitrator who rendered the Arbitration Award being appealed (the   Original Arbitrator  ).
Within five (5) calendar days after the Appellee has submitted to the Appellant the names of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators,
the Appellant must select, by written notice to the Appellee, three (3) of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators to act as the members
of the Appeal Panel. If the Appellant fails to select three (3) of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators in writing within such 5-day
period, then the Appellee may select such three (3) arbitrators from the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators by providing written notice
of such selection to the Appellant. 

(b)  If the Appellee
fails to submit to the Appellant the names of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days after the Appeal Date
pursuant to subparagraph (a) above, then the Appellant may at any time prior to the Appellee so designating the Proposed Appeal
Arbitrators, identify the names of five (5) arbitrators that are designated as  neutrals  or qualified arbitrators
by Utah ADR Service (none of whom may be the Original Arbitrator) by written notice to the Appellee. The Appellee may then, within
five (5) calendar days after the Appellant has submitted notice of its selected arbitrators to the Appellee, select, by written
notice to the Appellant, three (3) of such selected arbitrators to serve on the Appeal Panel. If the Appellee fails to select in
writing within such 5-day period three (3) of the arbitrators selected by the Appellant to serve as the members of the Appeal Panel,
then the Appellant may select the three (3) members of the Appeal Panel from the Appellant s list of five (5) arbitrators
by providing written notice of such selection to the Appellee. 

Arbitration Provisions  , Page   5  

(c)  If a selected
Proposed Appeal Arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve, then the party that selected such Proposed Appeal Arbitrator
may select one (1) of the other five (5) designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators within three (3) calendar days of the date a chosen
Proposed Appeal Arbitrator declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as an arbitrator. If at least three (3)
of the five (5) designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators decline or are otherwise unable to serve, then the Proposed Appeal Arbitrator
selection process shall begin again in accordance with this Paragraph 5.2;  provided, however , that any Proposed Appeal Arbitrators
who have already agreed to serve shall remain on the Appeal Panel. 

(d) The date that
all three (3) Proposed Appeal Arbitrators selected pursuant to this Paragraph 5.2 agree in writing (including via email) delivered
to both the Appellant and the Appellee to serve as members of the Appeal Panel hereunder is referred to herein as the   Appeal
Commencement Date  . No later than five (5) calendar days after the Appeal Commencement Date, the Appellee shall designate
in writing (including via email) to the Appellant and the Appeal Panel the name of one (1) of the three (3) members of the Appeal
Panel to serve as the lead arbitrator in the Appeal proceedings. Each member of the Appeal Panel shall be deemed an arbitrator
for purposes of these Arbitration Provisions and the Arbitration Act, provided that, in conducting the Appeal, the Appeal Panel
may only act or make determinations upon the approval or vote of no less than the majority vote of its members, as announced or
communicated by the lead arbitrator on the Appeal Panel.  If an arbitrator on the Appeal Panel
ceases or is unable to act during the Appeal proceedings, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with Paragraph
5.2 above to continue the Appeal as a member of the Appeal Panel.  If Utah ADR Services ceases to exist or to provide a list
of neutrals, then the arbitrators for the Appeal Panel shall be selected under the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration
Association. 

(d)  Subject to Paragraph
5.7 below, the cost of the Appeal Panel must be paid entirely by the Appellant. 

5.3        Appeal
Procedure.  The Appeal will be deemed an appeal of the entire Arbitration Award. In conducting the Appeal, the Appeal Panel
shall conduct a de novo review of all Claims described or otherwise set forth in the Arbitration Notice. Subject to the foregoing
and all other provisions of this Paragraph 5, the Appeal Panel shall conduct the Appeal in a manner the Appeal Panel considers
appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the Appeal, may hold one or more hearings and permit oral argument, and may
review all previous evidence and discovery, together with all briefs, pleadings and other documents filed with the Original Arbitrator
(as well as any documents filed with the Appeal Panel pursuant to Paragraph 5.4(a) below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection
with the Appeal, the Appeal Panel shall not permit the parties to conduct any additional discovery or raise any new Claims to be
arbitrated, shall not permit new witnesses or affidavits, and shall not base any of its findings or determinations on the Original
Arbitrator s findings or the Arbitration Award. 

5.4        Timing.

(a)    Within
seven (7) calendar days of the Appeal Commencement Date, the Appellant (i) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Appeal
Panel copies of the Appeal Notice, all discovery conducted in connection with the Arbitration, and all briefs, pleadings and other
documents filed with the Original Arbitrator (which material Appellee shall have the right to review and supplement if necessary),
and (ii) may, but is not required to, deliver to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellee a Memorandum in Support of the Appellant s
arguments concerning or position with respect to all Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded in the
Arbitration. Within seven (7) calendar days of the Appellant s delivery of the Memorandum in Support, as applicable, the
Appellee shall deliver to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellant a Memorandum in Opposition to the Memorandum in Support. Within
seven (7) calendar days of the Appellee s delivery of the Memorandum in Opposition, as applicable, the Appellant shall deliver
to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellee a Reply Memorandum to the Memorandum in Opposition. If the Appellant shall fail to substantially
comply with the requirements of clause (i) of this subparagraph (a), the Appellant shall lose its right to appeal the Arbitration
Award, and the Arbitration Award shall be final. If the Appellee shall fail to deliver the Memorandum in Opposition as required
above, or if the Appellant shall fail to deliver the Reply Memorandum as required above, then the Appellee or the Appellant, as
the case may be, shall lose its right to so deliver the same, and the Appeal shall proceed regardless. 

Arbitration Provisions  , Page   6  

(b)     Subject
to subparagraph (a) above, the parties hereby agree that the Appeal must be heard by the Appeal Panel within thirty (30) calendar
days of the Appeal Commencement Date, and that the Appeal Panel must render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days after
the Appeal is heard (and in no event later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Appeal Commencement Date). 

5.5        Appeal
Panel Award.  The Appeal Panel shall issue its decision (the   Appeal Panel Award  ) through the lead arbitrator
on the Appeal Panel. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Appeal Panel Award shall (a) supersede in its entirety
and make of no further force or effect the Arbitration Award (provided that any protective orders issued by the Original Arbitrator
shall remain in full force and effect), (b) be final and binding upon the parties, with no further rights of appeal, (c) be the
sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding any Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded
in the Arbitration, and (d) be promptly payable in United States dollars free of any tax, deduction or offset (with respect to
monetary awards). Any costs or fees, including without limitation attorneys  fees, incurred in connection with or incident
to enforcing the Appeal Panel Award shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, be charged against the party resisting such
enforcement. The Appeal Panel Award shall include Default Interest (with respect to monetary awards) at the rate specified in the
Note for Default Interest both before and after the Arbitration Award. Judgment upon the Appeal Panel Award will be entered and
enforced by a state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah. 

5.6        Relief.
 The Appeal Panel shall have the right to award or include in the Appeal Panel Award any relief which the Appeal Panel deems
proper under the circumstances, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive relief, provided that the Appeal
Panel may not award exemplary or punitive damages. 

5.7        Fees
and Costs.  As part of the Appeal Panel Award, the Appeal Panel is hereby directed to require the losing party (the party being
awarded the least amount of money by the arbitrator, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any
statutory fines, penalties, fees, or other charges awarded to any party) to (a) pay the full amount of any unpaid costs and fees
of the Arbitration and the Appeal Panel, and (b) reimburse the prevailing party (the party being awarded the most amount of money
by the Appeal Panel, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any statutory fines, penalties, fees,
or other charges awarded to any part) the reasonable attorneys  fees, arbitrator and Appeal Panel costs and fees, deposition
costs, other discovery costs, and other expenses, costs or fees paid or otherwise incurred by the prevailing party in connection
with the Arbitration (including without limitation in connection with the Appeal).
