  1. Description of Business 
    
  Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. ("  CBLI  " or the "   Company  ") is an innovative biopharmaceutical company developing novel approaches to activate the immune system and address serious medical needs. Our proprietary platform of Toll-like immune receptor activators has applications in radiation mitigation and immuno-oncology.  We combine our proven scientific expertise and our depth of knowledge about our products  mechanisms of action into a passion for developing drugs to save lives. Our most advanced product candidate is entolimod, an immune-stimulatory agent, which we are developing as a radiation countermeasure and an immunotherapy for oncology and other indications. 
    
  CBLI was incorporated in Delaware in June 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, New York. CBLI conducts business in the United States ("  U.S.  ") and in the Russian Federation ("  Russia  "), through several subsidiaries including:   one   wholly-owned subsidiary, BioLab 612, LLC ("  BioLab 612  "), which began operations in 2012; Panacela Labs, Inc. ("  Panacela  "), which was formed by us and Joint Stock Company  RUSNANO  ("  RUSNANO  ") our financial partner in the venture, in 2011; and, Incuron LLC ("  Incuron  "), which was formed by us and Bioprocess Capital Ventures ("  BCV  ") our financial partner in the venture, in 2010. During the twenty-one months ended   September 30, 2016   our ownership in Incuron has decreased from being a minority shareholder at January 1, 2015 to no longer being a shareholder as of April 29, 2015. Unless otherwise noted, references to the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  refer to Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. together with its subsidiaries. 
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of CBLI, BioLab 612, and Panacela. The accounts of Incuron are presented using the equity method of accounting for the period from January 1, 2015 through April 29, 2015, the date that we completed a sale of our entire equity interest in Incuron. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The consolidated condensed balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("  GAAP  ") for interim consolidated financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("  SEC  "). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC (the "2015 Form 10-K"). 
    
  In the opinion of the Company s management, any adjustments contained in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are of a normal recurring nature, and are necessary to fairly present the financial position of the Company as of   September 30, 2016  , along with its results of operations for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and cash flows for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for an entire year. 
  On January 28, 2015, the Company, after receiving approval from the Company s stockholders and board of directors, executed a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock at the ratio of   1:20  . Unless otherwise indicated, all of the Company s historical share balances and share price-related data have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this ratio. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $14.9 million   in the aggregate.  Management believes this capital will fund the Company's operations and cash requirements beyond one year. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (   FASB   ) issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents   

be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  This new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this statement. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Short-Term Investments 
  The Company s short-term investments are classified as available for sale. Accordingly, these investments are carried at fair market value. Short-term investments consisted of United States Treasury securities in the amount of   $9.9 million   which were owned by CBLI and had maturities of less than   12 months  . In addition,   $1.0 million   in certificates of deposit with maturity dates beyond three months and less than one year, and owned by Panacela, are also included. Unrealized gains and losses on available for-sale investments are reported as Other Comprehensive Loss, a separate component of stockholders  equity. Realized gains and losses, and interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as Interest and Other Expense. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 
  Significant Customers and Accounts Receivable 
  The following table presents our revenue by customer, on a proportional basis, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Our current Department of Defense ("  DoD  ") revenues come from development contracts that expire in 2017 and 2018, although each contract may be extended.  Our current Russian Government Agencies revenues come from development contracts that expire in 2016.  Our Incuron, LLC revenues come from a service agreement that is renegotiated annually 
  Accounts receivable consist of amounts due under reimbursement contracts with these customers. The Company extends unsecured credit to customers under normal trade agreements, which generally require payment within   30 days  . 
  Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash includes certificates of deposit, denominated in Russian rubles, which collateralize Panacela and BioLab 612 contracts with the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. These deposits provide additional assurance that  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents   

Panacela and BioLab 612 will satisfactorily perform their statements of work under the contracts. Both Panacela and BioLab 612 anticipate receiving these deposits at the completion of the contracts. 
    
  We previously disclosed that the Bank of Russia appointed temporary management of NOTA-Bank and that we had written off the full value of our restricted cash deposits with NOTA-Bank, as of the year ended December 31, 2015. The remaining amount of "Restricted Cash" at   September 30, 2016  , is on deposit with other banking institutions. During 2016 we adjusted the estimated loss on our restricted cash as more facts have become known which has resulted in a net gain of   $40,517  , which was recorded as Gain (loss) on Investments in the Statement of Operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .    
  Other Comprehensive Income (loss) 
    
  The Company applies the Codification on comprehensive income (loss) that requires disclosure of all components of comprehensive income (loss) on an annual and interim basis. Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. The following table presents the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
  The 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, or the Plan, authorizes CBLI to grant (i) options to purchase common stock, (ii) restricted or unrestricted stock units, and (iii) stock appreciation rights, so long as the exercise or grant price of each are at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. As of   September 30, 2016  , an aggregate of   650,000   shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the Plan, of which a total of   285,332   shares of common stock remained available for future awards and   236,124   shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance upon exercise of currently outstanding stock options. A single participant cannot be awarded more than   100,000   shares annually. Awards granted under the Plan have a contractual life of no more than   10 years  . The terms and conditions of equity awards (such as price, vesting schedule, term and number of shares) under the Plan are specified in an award document, and approved by the Company s board of directors or its management delegates. 
    
  The 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, provides a means by which eligible employees of the Company and certain designated related corporations may be given an opportunity to purchase shares of common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , there are   325,000   shares of common stock reserved for purchase under the ESPP. The number of shares reserved for purchase under the ESPP increases on January 1 of each calendar year by the lesser of: (i)   10%   of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding year, or (ii)   100,000   shares of common stock. The ESPP allows employees to use up to   15%   of their compensation to purchase shares of common stock at an amount equal to   85%   of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the offering date or the purchase date, whichever is less. 
  The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value of all stock options granted where the vesting period is based on length of service or performance, while a Monte Carlo simulation model is used for estimating the fair value of stock options with market-based vesting conditions. Set forth below are the assumptions used in valuing the stock options granted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and a discussion of the Company s methodology for developing each of the assumptions used.    No   options were granted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

10 

     Table of Contents   

Risk-free interest rate  means the range of U.S. Treasury rates with a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the option as of the date the option is granted. 
   Expected dividend yield  means the Company does not pay regular dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. 
   Expected life  means the period of time that options granted are expected to remain outstanding, based wholly on the use of the simplified (safe harbor) method. The simplified method is used because the Company does not yet have adequate historical exercise information to estimate the expected life the options granted. 
   Expected volatility  means a measure of the amount by which a financial variable, such as share price, has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (implied volatility) during a period. Expected volatility is based on the Company s historical volatility and incorporates the volatility of the common stock of comparable companies when the expected life of the option exceeds the Company s trading history. 
  Income Taxes 
  No   income tax expense was recorded for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as the Company does not expect to have taxable income for   2016   and did not have taxable income in   2015  . A full valuation allowance has been recorded against the Company s deferred tax asset. 
  Additionally, as disclosed in Note 9, Income Taxes, to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $128,665,000  , which begin to expire if not utilized by 2023, and approximately   $3,750,000   of federal tax credit carryforwards which begin to expire if not utilized by 2024. The Company also has U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $118,097,000  , which begin to expire if not utilized by 2027 and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately   $336,000  , which begin to expire if not utilized by 2022. The purchase of   6,459,948   shares of common stock by Mr. Davidovich on July 9, 2015 resulted in Mr. Davidovich owning   60.2%   of the Company. We therefore believe it highly likely that this transaction, more fully described in Note 6 Stockholders  Equity, to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K will be viewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a change of ownership as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 382. Consequently, the utilization of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as well as any additional net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards generated in 2015 through the issuance date, will be limited according to the provisions of Section 382, which will significantly limit the Company s ability to use these carryforwards to offset taxable income on an annual basis in future periods. As such, a significant portion of these carryforwards will likely expire before they can be utilized, even if the Company is able to generate taxable income that, except for this transaction, would have been sufficient to fully utilize these carryforwards. 
    
  Earnings (Loss) per Share 
  Basic net loss per share of common stock excludes dilution for potential common stock issuances and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted net loss per share is identical to basic net loss per share as potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because the inclusion of such securities would be antidilutive.  
  The Company has excluded the following securities from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because all such securities were antidilutive for the periods presented.  Additionally, there were no dilutive securities outstanding as of September 30, 2016.

     Table of Contents   

Contingencies 
  From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. For all periods presented, the Company was not a party to any pending material litigation that was estimable and had a probability of loss. 
   
  3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The Company measures and records warrant liabilities at fair value in the accompanying financial statements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, includes: 
             
    Level 1   Observable inputs for identical assets or liabilities such as quoted prices in active markets; 
                
    Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, which are therefore developed by the Company using estimates and assumptions that reflect those that a market participant would use. 
     Cash equivalents include United States Treasury Notes with original maturities of three months or less, at time of purchase and money market funds. Short-term investments primarily include United States Treasury Notes, along with certificates of deposit at commercial banking institutions, both with maturities of three months or more at time of purchase. 
  The valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of the company s assets and instruments classified in stockholders  equity are described as follows: United States Treasury Notes and money market funds included in cash equivalents and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported by an actively traded exchange and are included as Level 1 measurements in the table below. Certificates of deposit are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value and are included within short-term investments as a Level 2 measurement in the table below. 
  The following tables represent the Company s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

     Table of Contents   

The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to measure the accrued warrant liability and its accrual for compensatory stock options not yet issued. The following are the assumptions used to measure the accrued warrant liability which were determined in a manner consistent with that described for grants of options to purchase common stock as set forth in Note 2: 

The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 fair value measurements for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Unrealized gains or losses related to the accrued warrant liability were included as change in value of accrued warrant liability. There were   no   realized gains or losses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
     
   13 

     Table of Contents   

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
  The Company considers the accrued warrant liability and compensatory stock options not yet issued to be Level 3 because some of the inputs into the measurements are neither directly or indirectly observable. Both the accrued warrant liability and compensatory stock options not yet issued use management s estimate for the expected term. Additionally, the number of compensatory options awarded involves an estimate of management s performance in relation to the targets set forth in the Company s Executive Compensation Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Black-Scholes pricing model was used as the valuation technique for the accrued warrant liability and used the unobservable input for the expected term of    0.42   4.85   years. 
    
  Management believes the value of the accrued warrant liability is more sensitive to a change in the Company s stock price at the end of the respective reporting period as opposed to a change in the unobservable input described above. 
  The carrying amounts of the Company s short-term financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. 
   
  4. Sale of Incuron 
  On April 29, 2015, CBLI entered into an agreement to sell its equity stake in Incuron to Dr. Mikhail Mogutov, Chairman of Incuron s Board of Directors and founder of BCV and/or his designee. The Company s equity stake in Incuron was sold for (i)   $3 million   in cash and (ii) the transfer of   264,318   shares of the Company s common stock to escrow.  The escrow agent was instructed to sell the shares and to remit the net proceeds from the sale of those share to CBLI after deducting sales commissions and escrow agent fees.  At the time of sale, CBLI had a recorded asset value of   $3,906,321   for its interest in Incuron.  After recording the   $3 million   of cash proceeds from the sale,   $906,321   remained as a cost basis associated with the transfer of the   264,318   shares of the Company s common stock to escrow and was recorded as treasury stock.  As of December 31, 2015,   105,418   shares had been sold and   $417,545   in cash had been received from the escrow agent.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining shares have been sold and   $391,624   in cash has been received from the escrow agent. In addition, CBLI assigned its remaining intellectual property relating to Curaxin CBL0137 to Incuron in exchange for a   2%   royalty on the future commercialization, licensing or sale of the Curaxin CBL0137 technology.  
   
  5. Debt 
  On September 30, 2013, CBLI and BioLab 612 entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "  Loan Agreement  "), with Hercules Technology II, L.P. ("  Hercules  ") pursuant to which we issued a   $6.0 million   note. In June 2014, CBLI repaid   $4.0 million   of the loan. Between June 2014 and August 2015, CBLI repaid the remaining principal and interest in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement. In August 2015, CBLI fully paid the remaining obligations of the Loan Agreement along with a prepayment penalty of approximately   $28,000   and expensed approximately   $76,000   in deferred charges.  
  On September 3, 2013, Panacela entered into a Master Agreement and a Convertible Loan Agreement with RUSNANO, and CBLI pursuant to which Panacela issued a   $1,530,000   note payable to RUSNANO (the "  Panacela Loan  "). The Panacela Loan bore interest at a rate of   16.3%   per annum and matured on September 10, 2015. In December 2015, the Panacela Loan was fully retired.

  The Cleveland Clinic 
  CBLI has entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Cleveland Clinic pursuant to which CBLI was granted an exclusive license to The Cleveland Clinic s research base underlying our therapeutic platform and certain product candidates licensed to Panacela. CBLI has the primary responsibility to fund all newly developed patents; however, The Cleveland Clinic retains ownership of those patents covered by the agreement. CBLI also agreed to use commercially diligent efforts to bring one or more products to market as soon as practical, consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgments. There were   no   milestone or royalty payments paid to The Cleveland Clinic during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  The Company incurred   $0   and   $0   and   $0   and   $9,700   in expense to The Cleveland Clinic related to research grants and agreements for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company did not have any liabilities to The Cleveland Clinic at   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .   
  Buffalo BioLabs, LLC 
  Our CSO, Dr. Andrei Gudkov has business relationships with Buffalo BioLabs, LLC, or BBL, where Dr. Gudkov was a founder and currently serves as its Principal Scientific Advisor. The Company recognized   $178,625   and   $500,979   and   $670,534   and   $917,782   as research and development expense for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In addition, the Company had   $15,000   and   $0   in accrued expenses payable to BBL and   $0   and   $2,899   in accounts payable to BBL at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We also recognized   $11,553   and   $46,419   from BBL for sublease and other income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Pursuant to our real estate sublease and equipment lease with BBL, we had gross accounts receivables of   $226,023   and   $218,995   and net accounts receivables of   $23,872   and   $0   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  9. Subsequent event 
  In October 2016, the Company announced that the DoD has modified its Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program contract with CBLI, valued at up to   $9.2 million  , which supports further development of entolimod as a medical radiation countermeasure.  
    
  The modification changes the original statement of work of the contract by eliminating certain tasks no longer deemed critical for the preparation of a Biologics License Application of entolimod as a radiation countermeasure and establishes new tasks to address questions raised by the Food and Drug Administration including an aim to conduct a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic biocomparability study in a nonhuman primate model (the "  Biocomparability Study  ") along with other drug manufacturing related activities.   
    
  The objective of the Biocomparability Study is to compare the historical drug formulation used in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies versus the to-be-marketed drug product lots of entolimod submitted for approval under CBLI s application for pre-Emergency Use Authorization.  Entolimod is a novel, broad-spectrum investigational drug being developed to mitigate the life-threatening consequences of a radiological attack.  
    
  Because this contract modification involves replacement of certain tasks that cost in excess of tasks being eliminated, the aggregate amount of consideration payable to CBLI by the DoD will be unaffected.

  OVERVIEW 
  We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company developing novel approaches to activate the immune system and address serious medical needs. Our proprietary platform of Toll-like immune receptor activators has applications in mitigation of radiation injury and immuno-oncology. We combine our proven scientific expertise and our depth of knowledge about our products  mechanisms of action into a passion for developing drugs to save lives. Our most advanced product candidate is entolimod, an immune-stimulatory agent, which we are developing as a radiation countermeasure and an immunotherapy for oncology and other indications.  We conduct business in the U.S. and Russia through several subsidiaries, one of which is wholly-owned, BioLab 612; one of which is owned in collaboration with a financial partner, Panacela; and, a former subsidiary, Incuron. We held a majority ownership interest in Incuron until November 25, 2014, at which time Incuron was deconsolidated, after which we recognized our equitable interest in Incuron s results of operation as a single line item classified as "Equity in Loss of Incuron, LLC" in our Statements of Operations through April 29, 2015, the date at which our equity interest in Incuron became less than 20%.  Subsequent to April 29, 2015, Incuron was accounted for on the cost basis until we sold our remaining equity interest in Incuron on June 30, 2015.  
   
  Financial Overview 
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("  GAAP  "). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, income taxes, stock-based compensation, investments and in-process research and development. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
  Our revenue, operating results and profitability have varied, and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of work completed under new and existing grants, development contracts and collaborative relationships. 
  Revenue 
  Our revenue originates from grants and contracts from both United States ("  U.S.  ") federal government sources and Russian Federation ("  Russia  ") government sources and service contracts with Incuron. U.S. federal grants and contracts are provided to advance research and development of entolimod, our lead product candidate, which we believe is of interest for potential sale to the U.S. Department of Defense ("  DoD  ,") or the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("  BARDA  .") Russian government contracts are provided to advance research and development of products that may eventually be licensed for sale in Russia. We provide various research, management, business development and clinical advisory and management services to Incuron. 
    
  Research and Development Expenses 
  
   17 

     Table of Contents   

Research and development ("  R D  ") costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments are deferred and expensed as performance occurs. R D costs include the cost of our personnel (which consists of salaries, incentive and stock-based compensation), out-of-pocket pre-clinical and clinical trial costs usually associated with contract research organizations, drug product manufacturing and formulation, and a pro-rata share of facilities expense and other overhead items. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative ("  G A  ") functions include executive management, finance and administration, government affairs and regulations, corporate development, human resources, legal and compliance. The specific costs include the cost of our personnel consisting of salaries, incentive and stock-based compensation, out-of-pocket costs usually associated with attorneys (both corporate and intellectual property), bankers, accountants and other advisors and a pro-rata share of facilities expense and other overhead items. 
  Other Income and Expenses 
  Other recurring income and expenses primarily consists of interest income on our investments, changes in the market value of our derivative financial instruments and foreign currency transaction gains or losses. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 
  Our critical accounting policies and significant estimates are detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . Other than as set forth below, our critical accounting policies and significant estimates have not changed substantially from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  We use the Available-For-Sale accounting method to determine the fair value of certain cash equivalents and short-term investments invested in United States Treasury Notes or certificates of deposit. As of   September 30, 2016  , we held approximately   $0.4 million   in cash equivalents,   $9.9 million   in U.S. Treasury Notes which we classified as Level 1 and   $1.0 million   in certificates of deposit which we classified as Level 2. 
  We use the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of certain common stock warrants and stock options not yet issued on a recurring basis, and classify such warrants and options as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Black-Scholes model utilizes inputs consisting of: (i) the closing price of our common stock; (ii) the expected remaining life; (iii) the expected volatility using a weighted average of historical volatilities of CBLI and a group of comparable companies; and (iv) the risk-free market rate. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held approximately   $1.3 million   in accrued expenses related to warrants to purchase common stock, which we classified as Level 3. 
   
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Revenue 
  Revenue   increased from   approximately   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to approximately   $1.1 million   three months ended   September 30, 2016  , representing an   increase of   approximately   $0.6 million  , or   127.5%  , principally because of our JWMRP contract awarded to us in September 2015 for continued preclinical development of entolimod's biodefense indication and our grant from the Russian Federation Ministry of Industry and Trade ("  MPT  "), to evaluate safety and tolerability of entolimod as a neo-adjuvant therapy in treatment-na ve patients with primary colorectal cancer. Regarding our other Russian trials funded by MPT, reported contract revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately equal to the reported contract revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Differences in our revenue sources, by program, between the years are set forth in the following table.  Prospectively, the DoD contracts will gradually increase in significance and more significantly after the inclusion of a biocomparability study in the scope of the JWMRP contract, required by the FDA as part of the pre-EUA review.  Our MPT and Incuron service contracts are scheduled to complete in 2016.

  We anticipate our revenue over the next year will continue to be derived primarily from government grants and contracts. We plan to submit or have submitted proposals for government grants and contracts to various funding sources that have awarded us grants and contracts in the past, but there can be no assurance that we will receive future funding awards. The following table sets forth information regarding our currently active grants and contracts:

    The grants received from MPT are denominated in Russian Rubles (RUB). Cumulative Revenue includes contract receipts-to-date and outstanding receivables. Backlog amounts are valued at the period end exchange rate. Funded Award Value is the sum of Cumulative Revenue and Funded Backlog. Total Award Value is the sum of Funded Award Value and Unfunded Backlog. 
     Research and Development Expenses 
  R D expenses   decreased from     $2.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $1.1 million   three months ended   September 30, 2016  , representing a   decrease of     $1.0 million  , or   47.6%  . Variances in individual development programs are noted in the table below. The net decrease is primarily attributable to (i) reduced expenses related to the development of entolimod for biodefense applications as a result of our streamlined focus on the submission of our pre-EUA application and DoD contracts and (ii) the completion of preclinical studies of entolimod for oncology indications in 2015.  The remaining variances are not significant and we anticipate an increase in spending for entolimod for biodefense applications as activities increase in connection with the performance of the DoD contracts and our pursuit of approval by the European Medicines Agency.

General and Administrative Expenses 
  G A expenses   decreased from     $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $0.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , representing a decrease of   $0.5 million  , or   40.7%  . These reductions consisted of   $0.4 million   in compensation expense due to reductions in personnel and $0.1 million in other operating expenses. 
  Other Income and Expenses 
  Other expense     decreased from     $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $1.9 million   of   other income   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , representing an   income increase   of   $2.3 million  , or   565.1%  . This   increase   was primarily related to a   $1.8 million   non-cash gain related to our warrant liability, and   $0.5 million   was due to reductions in interest expense and foreign currency losses in approximately equal amounts.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenue 
  Revenue   increased from   approximately   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to approximately   $2.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing an   increase of   approximately   $1.1 million  , or   75.8%  , principally because of our JWMRP contract awarded to us in September 2015 for continued preclinical development of entolimod's biodefense indication. Regarding our Russian trials funded by MPT, reported contract revenue   increased by     $0.3 million   primarily due to variations in patient enrollment activity. Differences in our revenue sources, by program, between the years are set forth in the following table:

    The grants received from Russian government entities are denominated in Russian Rubles (RUB). The revenue above was calculated using average exchange rates for the periods presented. 
       
  Research and Development Expenses 
  R D expenses   decreased from   approximately   $5.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to approximately   $4.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing a   decrease of   approximately   $0.9 million  , or   17.3%   . Variances in individual development programs are noted in the table below. Expenses for CBLB612 increased due to clinical studies in the Russian Federation which completed earlier this year and that were not active in 2015 . These expense increases were offset by reductions in expenses related to our streamlined focus on the submission of our pre-EUA application and for preclinical studies of entolimod for oncology indications and Curaxins.  The remaining variances are not significant and we anticipate an increase in spending for entolimod for biodefense applications as activities increase in the performance of the DoD contracts. 

General and Administrative Expenses

     Table of Contents   

G A expenses   decreased from     $5.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $2.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing a net   decrease of     $2.5 million  , or   47.6%  . These net reductions consisted of a reduction of   $1.0 million   in compensation expense, due to reductions in personnel, a reduction of $1.4 million in professional fees, and offset by an increase of $0.1 million in other operating expenses.  The professional fee reduction primarily relates to a one-time expense of $0.6 million related to costs associated with our equity offering in February 2015. The majority of the costs of the February 2015 equity offering were expensed, and not otherwise charged to equity, as the majority of the net proceeds were considered derivative liabilities. Further professional fee reductions of $0.4 million were in connection with non-recurring activities in 2015 associated with strategic transactions and another $0.4 million were in connection with cost savings efforts to streamline operations. 
    
  Other Income and Expenses 
  Other income   increased from     $2.4 million   of   other expense   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $3.1 million   of   other income   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing an   income increase   of   $5.5 million  , or   229.5%  . This   income increase   was primarily related to a   $4.2 million   variance related to our warrant liability,   $0.4 million   related to our equity in the loss of Incuron accounted for as an equity investment during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $0.8 million   in other income primarily due to gains on the sale of equipment and a one-time gain in connection with the settlement of claims associated with our Nota-Bank deposits and foreign currency losses in 2015.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We have incurred net losses of approximately   $149.5 million   from our inception through   September 30, 2016  . Historically, we have not generated, and do not expect to generate in the immediate future, revenue from sales of product candidates. Since our founding in 2003, we have funded our operations through a variety of means: 

From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we have raised $144.7 million of net equity capital, including amounts received from the exercise of options and warrants. We have also received $7.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt instruments; 
                
    DoD and BARDA have funded grants and contracts totaling $60.4 million for the development of entolimod for its biodefense indication; 
                
    The Russian Federation has funded a series of our contracts totaling $17.3 million, based on the exchange rates in effect on the date of funding. These contracts include a requirement for us to contribute matching funds, which we have satisfied or expect to satisfy with both the value of developed intellectual property at the time of award, incurred development expenses and future expenses; 
                
    We have been awarded $4.0 million in grants and contracts not described above, all of which have been recognized at   September 30, 2016  ; 
                
    Incuron was formed to develop and commercialize the Curaxins product line, including its lead oncology drug candidate CBL0137. In 2015, we sold our ownership interest for approximately $4.0 million and retain a 2% royalty interest in the CBL0137 technology; and 
                
    Panacela was formed to develop and commercialize preclinical compounds, which were transferred to Panacela through assignment and lease agreements. RUSNANO contributed $9.0 million to Panacela and CBLI contributed $3.0 million plus intellectual property to Panacela. As of the date of this filing, CBLI owns 67.57% of Panacela. 
     We have incurred cumulative net losses and expect to incur additional losses related to our R D activities. We do not have commercial products and have limited capital resources. At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $14.9 million   which, along with the active government contracts described above, are expected to fund our projected operating requirements beyond one year. However, until we are able to commercialize our product candidates at a level that covers our cash expenses, we will need to raise substantial additional capital, which we may be unable to raise in sufficient amounts, when needed and at acceptable terms. Our plans with regard to these matters may include seeking additional capital through debt or equity financing, the sale or license of drug candidates, or obtaining additional research funding from the U.S. or Russian governments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future financing on acceptable terms, or that we can obtain additional government financing for our operations. If we are unable to raise adequate capital and/or achieve profitable operations, future operations might need to be scaled back or discontinued. The financial

repayment of the Hercules Loan more fully described in Note 5, "Debt" included our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
     Impact of Exchange Rate Fluctuations 
  Our reported financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble. Between January 1,   2016   and   September 30, 2016  , this rate fluctuated by   13.4%  . For calendar   2015  , this rate fluctuated by   29.6%  . Translation gains or losses result primarily from the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the reported U.S. dollar equivalent of ruble denominated cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. Variances in the exchange rate for these items have not been realized; as such the resulting gains or losses are recorded as other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
           Item 3.  
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     Not required for smaller reporting company filers. 
   
           Item 4.  
    Controls and Procedures 
     Effectiveness of Disclosure 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of   September 30, 2016  . Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II   Other Information 

Item 1.  
    Legal Proceedings 
     In the ordinary course of business, we may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with ongoing business activities. The results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable resolutions are possible and could materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
  While the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, there are no matters, as of   September 30, 2016  , that, in the opinion of management, might have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
           Item 1A.
