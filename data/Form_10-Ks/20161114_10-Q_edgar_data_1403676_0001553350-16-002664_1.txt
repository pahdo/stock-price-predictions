  NOTE 1     Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  Organization  
   
 GelTech Solutions, Inc., or GelTech or the Company, generates revenue primarily from marketing products based around the following four product categories (1) FireIce , a water enhancing powder that can be utilized both as a fire suppressant in wildland and urban firefighting, including fires in underground utility structures, and in wildland firefighting as a medium-term fire retardant to protect wildlands, structures and firefighters; (2) FireIce Shield , a line of products used by welders, plumbers, first responders and consumers to protect assets from fire; (3) Soil  2  O   Dust Control , our application which is used for dust mitigation in the construction and mining industries, in rural communities with unpaved roads, as well as by equestrian facilities and (4) Soil  2  O , a product which reduces the use of water and is primarily marketed to golf courses and commercial landscapers and most recently to homeowners via the Soil  2  O  Home Lawn Kit. The Company also markets equipment that is used in the application of these primary products including (1) Emergency Manhole FireIce Delivery System, or EMFIDS, an innovative system designed to deliver FireIce  into a manhole in the event of a fire or explosion;  (2) FireIce  Home Defense Unit, a system for applying FireIce  to structures to protect them from wildfires and (3)  the FireIce Shield  spray unit which can be used to protect assets for industrial applications including protecting communication towers during welding.  
   
 Our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and we need to generate sufficient material revenues to support the ongoing business of GelTech. See further discussion in Note 2. 
   
 The corporate office is located in Jupiter, Florida. 
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries: FireIce Gel, Inc., GelTech International, Inc. and Weather Tech Innovations, Inc. There has been no activity in FireIce Gel, Inc., Weather Tech Innovations, Inc. and GelTech International, Inc. and these entities are in the process of being dissolved.   
   
 These unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by  GAAP  for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The information included in these unaudited consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations contained in this report and the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the six months ended December 31, 2015 filed on March 31, 2016. 
   
    Inventories  
   
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories as of September 30, 2016 consisted of raw materials and finished goods in the amounts of $779,221 and $858,170, respectively. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing its consolidated financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include the allowance for     doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, valuation of inventories, valuation of options and warrants granted for services or settlements, valuation of common stock granted for services or debt conversion, valuation of debt discount related to the beneficial conversion feature of convertible notes, accruals for litigation losses and the valuation of deferred tax assets.

Revenue Recognition  
   
 Revenue from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products have been shipped to the customer, economic risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured, and any future obligations of the Company are insignificant. Revenue is shown net of returns and allowances. The Company provides certain customers with the right of return for unsold product. Sales to these customers are recorded as the customer sells the product, thus removing the right of return. 
   
 Products shipped from either our third-party fulfillment companies or our Jupiter, Florida or Irwindale, California locations are shipped FOB shipping point. Normal payment terms are net 30 days depending on the arrangement we have with the customer. As such, revenue is recognized when product has been shipped from either the third-party fulfillment company or from the Jupiter, Florida or Irwindale, California locations.  
   
 The Company follows the guidance of ASC 605-50-25,  Revenue Recognition, Customer Payments . Accordingly, any incentives received from vendors are recognized as a reduction of the cost of products. Promotional products or samples given to customers or potential customers are recognized as a cost of goods sold. However, products we utilize to perform demonstrations for potential customers are recorded as a marketing expense in operations. 
   
 In June 2016, the Company entered into two agreements with a state forestry agency whereby the Company agreed to pay for and build two fixed airport mixing facilities in order to support the state agency s aerial wildland firefighting operations.  In connection with the agreement, the state agency has the use of the equipment in exchange for paying a premium price per bucket for our HVO-F aerial FireIce product and also making an initial minimum purchase of 200 buckets per year.  As such, the Company has deferred the premium portion of the bucket price for the minimum purchase amount and will recognize the revenue related to the premium over 12 months.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recognized $5,333 in revenue and has deferred $10,667 of the minimum purchase amounts. 
   
  Net Earnings (Loss) per Share  
   
 The Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10,   Earnings per Share .  ASC 260-10 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The Company s diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  At September 30, 2016, there were options to purchase 11,412,840 shares of the Company s common stock, warrants to purchase 14,012,579 shares of the Company s common stock and 20,978,023 shares of the Company s common stock are reserved for convertible notes which may dilute future earnings per share.  
   
  Stock-Based Compensation  
   
 The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718-10,   Share-Based Payment ,  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values. 
   
   Determining Fair Value Under ASC 718-10    
   
   The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. The Company s determination of fair value using an option-pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding the number of highly subjective variables. 
   
   The Company estimates volatility based upon the historical stock price of the Company and estimates the expected term for employee stock options using the simplified method for employees and directors and the contractual term for non-employees.  The risk free rate is determined based upon the prevailing rate of United States Treasury securities with similar maturities.

  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   
  (Unaudited)  

The fair values of stock options and warrants granted during the period from January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 were estimated using the following assumptions:  

New Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , which requires an entity to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The accounting standard is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect this accounting standard to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
   
 No additional Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) which were not effective until after September 30, 2016 are expected to have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
   
      NOTE 2   Going Concern  
   
 These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize it assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit and stockholders  deficit of $46,919,381 and $5,803,758, respectively, incurred a loss from operations of $2,817,209 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and used cash in operations of $2,440,732 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  In addition, the Company has not yet generated revenue sufficient to support ongoing operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $1,805,000 in advances from its convertible line of credit with its president and principal shareholder. The Company also received $610,955 from Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC in connection with a $10 million stock purchase agreement entered into in August 2015. See Note 4. 
   
 Management believes that the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and additional funding from its president and principal shareholder provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  Ultimately, the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate sufficient revenue to attain profitable operations.

NOTE 3   Convertible Note Agreement    s   Related Party  
   
 The Company currently has three debt facilities outstanding, all of them held by its president and principal shareholder.  
   
 One convertible note in the amount of $1,997,483, dated February 1, 2013 was a consolidation of prior debt instruments. The note bore annual interest of 7.5%, was convertible at $0.35 per share and due December 31, 2016. On February 12, 2015, this note was modified by securing the note with all the assets of the Company and by extending the due date of the note from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2020. The modification was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470. As a result of the modification the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $34,586. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized interest expense of $112,358. As of September 30, 2016, the principal balance of the note is $1,997,483 and accrued interest amounted to $99,737. In February 2016, the Company issued 428,032 shares of common stock to its president and principal shareholder in payment of accrued interest of $149,811 resulting in a loss on conversion of interest of $72,765. 
   
 A second convertible note in the amount of $1,000,000 dated July 11, 2013 related to a new funding on that date. The note bore annual interest of 7.5%, was convertible at $1.00 per share and was due July 10, 2018. In connection with the note, the Company issued five year warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.30 per share. On February 12, 2015, this note was modified by securing the note with all the assets of the Company, by extending the due date of the note from July 10, 2018 to December 31, 2020 and by reducing the conversion rate of the note from $1.00 to $0.35 per share. The modification was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470. As a result of the modification, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $562,062. Also, in connection with the modification the Company recorded a note discount of $60,390, related to the relative fair value of the warrants attached to the note. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded interest expense of $7,703 to amortize the discounts related to the warrants of the note, originated in July 2013. As of September 30, 2016, the balance of the unamortized discount related to the warrants was $43,662. In July 2016, the Company issued 208,333 shares of common stock in payment of accrued interest of $75,000. As of September 30, 2016, the principal balance on this note is $1,000,000 and accrued interest amounted to $16,644. 
   
 In connection with the debt modifications described above, the Company entered into a Secured Revolving Convertible Promissory Note Agreement for up to $4 million with its president and principal shareholder.  On April 8, 2016, the Company and its president and principal shareholder entered into the First Amendment to Secured Revolving Convertible Promissory Note Agreement increasing the credit facility from $4 million to $5 million. On September 27, 2016, the Company and its president and principal shareholder entered into the Second Amendment to Secured Revolving Convertible Promissory Note Agreement increasing the credit facility from $5 million to $6 million. Under the agreement, the Company may, with the prior approval of its president and principal shareholder, receive advances under this agreement. Each advance bears an annual interest rate of 7.5%, is due December 31, 2020 and is convertible at the rate equal to the closing price of the Company s common stock on the day prior to the date the parties agree to the advance. In addition, the Company will issue the Company s president and principal shareholder two year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The number of warrants issued equals 50% of the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the related advance. 
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received twelve advances totaling $1,805,000 with conversion rates between $0.28 and $0.55 per share, and issued two year warrants to purchase 2,481,568 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. In connection with these advances, the Company has recorded loan discounts related to the warrants and the beneficial conversion features of the advances amounting to $151,788 and $151,788, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recognized interest expense of $60,538 related to the amortization of loan discounts.  As of September 30, 2016, the principal balance of the advances was $5,070,000, the balance of the unamortized discounts related to the warrants and the beneficial conversion feature was $361,298 and $361,298, respectively, and the balance of accrued interest was $210,740. 
   
 The calculated loan discounts were based on the relative fair value of the warrants which were calculated by the Company using the Black Scholes option pricing model, using volatilities of between 103.14% and 105.41%, based on the Company s historical stock price, discount rates from 0.58% to 0.90%, and expected terms of 2 years, the term of the warrants.

Words such as may, will, should, would, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof.

Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the Risk Factors contained in our Transition Report on Form 10-KT filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 31, 2016. 
   
  Overview  
   
 GelTech Solutions, Inc., or GelTech or the Company, generates revenue primarily from marketing products based around the following four product categories (1) FireIce , a water enhancing powder that can be utilized both as a fire suppressant in wildland and urban firefighting, including fires in underground utility structures, and in wildland firefighting as a medium-term fire retardant to protect wildlands, structures and firefighters; (2) FireIce Shield , a line of products used by welders, plumbers, manufacturers, first responders and consumers to protect assets from fire; (3) Soil  2  O   Dust Control , our application which is used for dust mitigation in the road construction and mining industries, as well as in rural communities with unpaved roads to deal with daily dust control issues and (4) Soil  2  O , a product which reduces the use of water required for irrigation and is primarily marketed to golf courses and commercial landscapers and most recently to homeowners via the Soil  2  O  Home Lawn Kit. The Company also markets equipment that is used in the application of these primary products including (1) Emergency Manhole FireIce Delivery System, or EMFIDS, an innovative system designed to deliver FireIce  into a manhole in the event of a fire or explosion; (2) the FireIce Shield CTP System, a mobile spray unit that can be used to protect communication tower electronics during hot work and (3) FireIce  Home Defense Unit, a system for applying FireIce  to structures to protect them from wildfires.  
   
   USDA Correspondence   
   
 On October 3, 2016, the Company received a letter from United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the U.S Forestry Service ( USFS ) regarding the clarification of the ingredients used in our FireIce product as well as a request by the USFS to provide an alternative name to be listed on the Qualified Products List ( QPL ) which distinguishes the product from the Company s brand of FireIce.  
   
 The USFS letter requested the Company provide an alternative name to distinguish the QPL listed product, FireIce, from the Company s unique and registered brand name FireIce . The Company will be submitting a name change request from FireIce to FireIce 561-F, which maintains the root word FireIce, but in addition contains a distinguishing identifier that meets the approval of the USFS. The Company believes that the change in the name of FireIce will satisfy both the request of the USFS while maintaining the brand recognition of the Company.  
   
 If the Company is unable to come to a positive resolution with the USFS relating to the name change or our clarification of the ingredients ,  the USFS may remove FireIce from the QPL. In such event, the Company will be prohibited from selling FireIce for use on certain federal lands. This will have no effect on any federal agency contract now in existence, but may have an effect on future federal agency contracts with respect to FireIce, but not the next generation line of products, including but not limited to FireIce HVOF and other products in which the Company may seek USFS approval.   
   
 The FireIce HVOF product currently being used by state and provincial agencies is a formulation that includes the product, FireIce that is listed on the QPL, plus additional compounds to improve the visibility and performance of the product. The FireIce HVOF product produced by the Company is its next generation line of product which is superior to FireIce, its QPL listed product formulation. The Company anticipates it will be applying for USFS approval with respect to its next generation line of products, including FireIce HVOF.  
   
 Although state agencies are not required to purchase products listed on the QPL, there is no assurance that states will not be deterred from buying or continuing to buy FireIce HVOF should FireIce no longer be listed on the QPL.  
   
 Our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and we need to generate sufficient material revenues to support the ongoing business of the Company.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.  
   
 The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, results of operations information from our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements: 

Sales  
   
 Sales of product during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $634,398 for FireIce  and related products, $155,027 for   Soil 2 O  and Soil 2 O  Dust Control, $103,261 for FireIce Shield  and $5,555 for GT-W14.  FireIce  sales consisted of $572,922 related to product and equipment, sales primarily to state and provincial wildland firefighting agencies and $42,457 related to sales of extinguishers and product to our municipal distributor. Our Wildland sales declined in 2016 as several state agencies had inventory remaining from 2015 purchases and there was a decline in the number and severity of wildfires this season in the states and provinces that use our product. The Soil 2 O  sales consisted of sales of Soil 2 O  topical of $58,547 and sales of Soil 2 O  dust control of $96,480. Sales of FireIce Shield  consisted of sales of asset protection canisters of $48,554 plus sales of FireIce Shield spray bottles of $53,091.  Both FireIce  wildland sales and Soil 2 O  dust control sales are seasonal in nature with both peak seasons lasting from March through October.  We anticipate FireIce Shield  sales to be less seasonal. We do not expect the USFS QPL issue, described above under USDA Correspondence to significantly affect wildland sales as our current customer base consists of state and provincial agencies who are not restricted from using products not on the QPL. We expect sales of FireIce Shield to increase with the hiring of a sales professional with experience in both the plumbing and welding supply businesses, plus the launch of our new ChargeSafe  Case product which uses our FireIce Shield  product.  Based on these factors, we expect that our revenues will increase in the future.  
   
  Cost of Goods Sold  
   
 The decrease in cost of goods sold was the result of the decrease in sales, plus inventory amounting to $67,439 having been written off for obsolescence during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 30.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 34.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, after factoring out the obsolescence write off.  The difference is due to differences in the sales mix.  We expect future cost of sales as a percentage of sales will be consistent with the cost of sales percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

GELTECH SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG A)  
   
 The decrease in SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from (1) a decrease in equity base compensation of $406,683 resulting from fewer warrants granted to consultants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016; (2) a decrease in professional fees resulting from a reduction of fees related to litigation of $118,429; (3) a decrease in sales and marketing expense related to last year s marketing campaign for the   Soil 2 O  Home Lawn Kit and (4) a decrease in bad debt expense of $23,899 due to the receipt of payment for an account that was previously written off.  These decreases were partially offset by (1) an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $140,812 as a result of additional consulting fees and commissions which were partially offset by reductions in staff; (2) an increase in investor relations expense of $17,933 as a result of our hiring a new investor relations firm; and (3) an increase in travel expense of $72,876 related primarily to setting up multiple airbases in one state and one Canadian province.  

Research and Development Expenses  
   
 The research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related primarily to third party testing to determine the efficacy of GelTech s products for new and existing applications.  
   
  Loss from Operations  
   
 The decrease in loss from operations resulted from the higher gross profit and the lower operating expenses as described above. 
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 Other expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of (1) interest expense of $516,281; (2) a loss on litigation settlement of $320,631 resulting from claims brought against the Company by a former employee, which was partially offset by a gain on settlement of $300,000 relating to a claim filed by the Company against its employment practices insurance carrier; (3) a loss resulting from extending the term of certain warrants for an additional one year period of $206,620; and (4) a loss on conversion of interest of $72,765.  Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of (1) a loss on extinguishment of debt of $596,648; (2) a loss on settlement of $412,867 related to a former director and employee, and (3) interest expense of $281,990 which was partially offset by a gain on conversion of interest of $12,841 and the reversal of a litigation accrual of $56,956 based on a court ruling. 
   
  Net Loss   
   
 The lower net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the higher gross profit, and lower operating costs and lower other expense as described above. Net loss per common share was $0.07 and $0.09, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 50,562,616 and 47,490,364, respectively.  
   
  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.

Sales  
   
 Sales of product during the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $155,466 for FireIce  and related products, $55,545 for   Soil 2 O , $4,691 for FireIce Shield  and $1,697 for GT-W14.  FireIce  sales consisted of $148,929 related to product and equipment sales primarily to wildland firefighting agencies and $2,315 related to sales of extinguishers and product to our municipal distributor. Our Wildland sales declined in 2016 as several state agencies had inventory remaining from 2015 purchases and there was a decline in the number and severity of wildfires this season in the states and provinces that use our product. The Soil 2 O  sales consisted of sales of Soil 2 O  topical of $14,808 and sales of Soil 2 O  dust control of $37,893. Sales of FireIce Shield  consisted of sales of asset protection canisters of $2,576 plus sales of FireIce Shield spray bottles of $1,173.  Both FireIce  and Soil 2 O  dust control sales are seasonal in nature with both peak seasons lasting from March through October.  We anticipate that FireIce Shield  sales will be less seasonal. Our FireIce Shield product is gaining acceptance with welders, plumbers and others working under flammable and hot conditions. Based on these factors, we expect that our revenues will increase in the future. 
   
  Cost of Goods Sold  
   
 The decrease in cost of goods sold was the result of the decrease in sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 32.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 33.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to differences in the product sales mix. We expect future cost of sales as a percentage of sales will be consistent with the cost of sales percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG A)  
   
 The decrease in SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from (1) a decrease in equity based compensation of $117,364 resulting from fewer warrants granted to consultants during the three months ended September 30, 2016; (2) a decrease in professional fees of $59,250 resulting from a reduction of fees related to litigation; and (3) a decrease in sales and marketing expense of $50,268 related to last year s marketing campaign for the   Soil 2 O  Home Lawn Kit. These decreases were partially offset by (1) an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $83,433 as a result of additional consulting fees and commissions which were partially offset by reductions in staff; (2) an increase in facilities expense of $11,727 as a result of our using two additional strategically located third party warehouses for inventory; and (3) an increase in travel expense of $41,863 related primarily to setting up multiple airbases in one state and one Canadian province.  
   
  Research and Development Expenses  
   
 The research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to third party testing to determine the efficacy of GelTech s products for new and existing applications.  
   
  Loss from Operations  
   
 The increase in the loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the lower gross profit which was only partially offset by the lower operating expenses as described above. 
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 Other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of (1) interest expense of $188,897.  Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of interest expense of $113,694 less other income of $56,956 related to the reduction of a litigation accrual based on a court ruling. 
    
  Net Loss   
   
 The higher net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the lower gross profit and higher other expense which was partially offset by the lower operating expenses as described above. Net loss per common share was $0.02 and $0.02, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

GELTECH SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

From January 1, 2016 through the date of this report, the Company received $715,075 in exchange for 2,078,008 shares of common stock in connection with the stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park and has received $500,000 in exchange for 1,591,700 shares of common stock and two year warrants to purchase 795,850 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share in connection with three private placements, one with a director and his wife and two with another accredited investor.  
   
   Liquidity and Capital Resource Considerations   
   
  As of November 14, 2016, we had approximately $120,000 in available cash.  
   
 In August 2015, GelTech signed a $10 million Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park. The Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park whereby we agreed to file a registration statement related to the transaction with the SEC covering the shares that may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement. 
   
 Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, GelTech has the right to sell, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase, up to $10 million in shares of the Company s common stock, subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 30-month period commencing on the date that a registration statement, which the Company agreed to file with the SEC pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC. The Company filed the registration statement with the SEC on October 5, 2015 and it was declared effective by the SEC on October 16, 2015. F ailure of our stock price to increase will impact our ability to meet our working capital needs through Lincoln Park.   
   
 In September 2016, the Company and its president and principal shareholder entered into the Second Amendment to a Secured Revolving Convertible Promissory Note Agreement increasing the credit facility from $5 million to $6 million.  As of the filing date of this report, Mr. Reger has advanced $5,195,000 to the Company under the credit facility.   
   
  Until the Company generates sufficient revenue to sustain the business, our operations will continue to rely on Mr. Michael Reger s investments and the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park.  If Mr. Reger were to cease providing working capital, the stock price were to fall below the floor price in the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park or the Company is unable to generate substantial cash flows from sales of its products or complete financings, the Company may not be able to remain operational. Although we do not anticipate the need to purchase any additional material capital assets in order to carry out our business, it may be necessary for us to purchase additional support vehicles or mixing base equipment in the future, depending on demand.

  Principal Accounting Estimates  
   
 In response to the SEC s financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, the Company has selected its most subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on the Company s financial condition. These estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.   
   
 There were no material changes to our principal accounting estimates during the period covered by this report.

  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  
   
 This report contains forward-looking statements including our liquidity and anticipated capital asset requirements and expected increase in sales of our products, revenues, number of states ordering our products, impact of the USFS QPL issue on sales of FireIce. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as  anticipates,   intends,   plans,   seeks,   believes,   estimates,   expects  and similar references to future periods. 

18 

GELTECH SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the failure to receive material orders from the utility and mining companies, global and domestic economic conditions, budgetary pressures facing state and local governments, our failure to receive or the potential delay of anticipated orders for our products, failure to receive acceptance of FireIce  by State and Local governments, failure to obtain regulatory approval on our products, obtaining advances under the Reger credit facility, states choosing not to purchase FireIce as a result of the USFS QPL issue, the failure to keep the Lincoln Park registration statement effective, our stock price falling below the minimum stock price requirement under the Lincoln Park Agreement or Lincoln Park suffering unanticipated liquidity issues. 
   
 Further information on our risk factors is contained in our filings with the SEC, including our Prospectus dated April 6, 2016. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
