Note 1:   Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Account Policies   
     
  The unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016, have been prepared by The L.S. Starrett Company (the  Company ) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial reporting.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  These unaudited financial statements, which, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.  Operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future interim period or for the entire fiscal year.  
     
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Note 2 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  

Note 2:   Recent A  ccounting Pronouncements   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to the  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The standard requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This standard is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those years. Earlier application will be permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company expects to adopt this standard on July 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.    
   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." Previous to the issuance of this ASU, ASC 330 required that an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. ASU 2015-11 specifies that  market  is defined as  net realizable value,  or the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Application is to be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.      
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) .  The ASU requires that organizations that lease assets recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by those leases.  The ASU will affect the presentation of lease related expenses on the income statement and statement of cash flows and will increase the required disclosures related to leases.  This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.  It is expected that a key change upon adoption will be the balance sheet recognition of leased assets and liabilities and that any changes in income statement recognition will not be material.  
   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." The ASU affects the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions as it relates to accounting for income taxes, accounting for forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those periods with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted the new guidance prospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3:  Stock-based Compensation   
     
  On September 5, 2012, the Board of Directors adopted The L.S. Starrett Company 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan (the  2012 Stock Plan ). The 2012 stock plan was approved by shareholders on October 17, 2012. The 2012 Stock Plan permits the granting of the following types of awards to officers, other employees and non-employee directors: stock options; restricted stock awards; unrestricted stock awards; stock appreciation rights; stock units including restricted stock units; performance awards; cash-based awards; and awards other than previously described that are convertible or otherwise based on stock. The 2012 Stock Plan provides for the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of common stock.          
     
  Options granted vest in periods ranging from one year to three years and expire ten years after the grant date. Restricted stock units ( RSU ) granted generally vest from one year to three years. Vested restricted stock units will be settled in shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, there were 20,000 stock options and 105,634 restricted stock units outstanding. In addition, there were 346,600 shares available for grant under the 2012 Stock Plan as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  For stock option grants the fair value of each grant is estimated at the date of grant using the Binomial Options pricing model. The Binomial Options pricing model utilizes assumptions related to stock volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the dividend yield, and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on the historic volatility of the Company s stock price. The risk free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury Yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life is determined using the average of the vesting period and contractual term of the options (Simplified Method).      
     
  No stock options were granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  The weighted average contractual term for stock options outstanding as of   September 30, 2016 was 6.25 years.  There was no intrinsic value of stock options outstanding as of   September 30, 2016. Stock options exercisable as of   September 30, 2016 were 20,000.   In recognizing stock compensation expense for the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan management has estimated that there will be no forfeitures of options.  
     
  The Company accounts for stock options and RSU awards by recognizing the expense of the grant date fair value ratably over vesting periods generally ranging from one year to three years. The related expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.    
     
  There were 45,000 RSU awards with a fair value of $10.86 per RSU granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016. There were 12,733 RSUs settled during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The aggregate intrinsic value of RSU awards outstanding as of September 30, 2016 was $1.0 million. As of September 30, 2016 all vested awards had been issued and settled.  
     
  On February 5, 2013, the Board of Directors adopted The L.S. Starrett Company 2013 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the  2013 ESOP ). The purpose of the plan is to supplement existing Company programs through an employer funded individual account plan dedicated to investment in common stock of the Company, thereby encouraging increased ownership of the Company while providing an additional source of retirement income.  The plan is intended as an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Section 4975 (e) (7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. U.S. employees who have completed a year of service are eligible to participate.   
     
  Compensation expense related to all stock based plans for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.1 million for both periods.  As of September 30, 2016, there was $1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to outstanding stock-based compensation arrangements. Of this cost $1.1 million relates to performance based RSU grants that are not expected to be awarded. The remaining $0.3 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years.  

Note 4:   Inventories   
     
  Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):  

9

LIFO inventories were $11.5 million and $10.5 million at September 30, 2016 and at June 30, 2016, respectively, such amounts being approximately $28.8 million less than if determined on a FIFO basis.  The use of LIFO, as compared to FIFO, resulted in no material change in cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a $0.1 million increase in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Note 5:   Goodwill and Intangible Assets   
     
  The Company s acquisition of Bytewise in 2011 gave rise to goodwill. The Company performed a qualitative analysis in accordance with ASU 2011-08 for its October 1, 2015 annual assessment of goodwill (commonly referred to as  Step Zero ). From a qualitative perspective, in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its respective carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances were taken into account, with greater weight assigned to events and circumstances that most affect the fair value or the carrying amounts of its assets. Items that were considered included, but were not limited to, the following: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and changes in management or key personnel. After assessing these and other factors the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of October 1, 2015.   
     
  Amortizable intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):  

Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of expected economic benefit.  
     
  The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets subject to amortization are 14 years for trademarks and trade names, 8 years for non-compete agreements, 10 years for completed technology,  8 years for customer relationships and 5 years for software development.  
     
  The estimated aggregate amortization expense for the remainder of fiscal 2017 and for each of the next five years and thereafter, is as follows (in thousands):  

Note 6:  Pension and Post-retirement Benefits   
     
  Net periodic benefit costs for the Company's defined benefit pension plans consist of the following (in thousands):  

10

Net periodic benefit costs for the Company's post-retirement medical plan and life insurance consists of the following (in thousands):     

The Company s pension plans use fair value as the market-related value of plan assets and recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of ten percent (10%) of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or of the plans  projected benefit obligation in net periodic (benefit) cost as of the plan measurement date, which is the same as the fiscal year end of the Company. Net actuarial gains or losses that are less than 10% of the thresholds noted above are accounted for as part of the accumulated other comprehensive loss.  

Note 7:   Debt   
     
  Debt is comprised of the following (in thousands):  

The Company amended its Loan and Security Agreement, which includes a Line of Credit and a Term Loan, in January 2015 with changes that took effect on April 25, 2015.  Borrowings under the Line of Credit may not exceed $23.0 million.  The Line of Credit expires on April 30, 2018 and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.5%.  The effective interest rate on the Line of Credit under the Loan and Security Agreement for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively.   Based upon its three year term, the Line of Credit has been classified as long-term. As of September 30, 2016, $9.4 million was outstanding on the Line of Credit.   
     
  On November 22, 2011, in conjunction with the Bytewise acquisition, the Company entered into a $15.5 million term loan (the  Term Loan ) under the then existing Loan and Security Agreement.  The Term Loan is a ten year loan bearing a fixed interest rate of 4.5% and is payable in fixed monthly payments of principal and interest of $160,640.  The Term Loan, had a balance of $8.9 million at September 30, 2016.  
     
  The material financial covenants of the amended Loan and Security Agreement are: 1) funded debt to EBITDA, excluding non-cash and retirement benefit expenses ( maximum leverage ), not to exceed 2.25 to 1. 2) annual capital expenditures not to exceed $15.0 million, 3) maintain a Debt Service Coverage Rate of a minimum of 1.25 to 1 and 4) maintain consolidated cash plus liquid investments of not less than $10.0 million at any time.  The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2016.  

Note 8:   Income Tax   
     
  The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax and various state, local and foreign income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.  The Company s domestic and foreign tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses.  Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to the Company s interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it files.    

11

The Company provides for income taxes on an interim basis based on an estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. This estimate is reassessed on a quarterly basis. Discrete tax items are accounted for in the quarterly period in which they occur.  
     
  The tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $717,000 on a profit before tax of $1,476,000 (an effective tax rate of 48.6%). The tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $660,000 on a profit before tax for the quarter of $482,000 (an effective tax rate of 136.9%). The tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of approximately 40% as a result of discrete adjustments primarily for the impact of a tax rate change in the U.K. applied to deferred tax assets which increased tax expense by $298,000 in the quarter. The tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher than the U.S. federal and state statutory rate of approximately 40% primarily due to losses in some foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is recognized. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, there was a discrete reduction to tax expense of $54,000 related to provision to return adjustments in the UK.   
     
  U.S. Federal tax returns through fiscal 2012 are generally no longer subject to review by tax authorities; however, tax loss carryforwards from years before fiscal 2012 are still subject to adjustment. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has substantially resolved all open income tax audits and there were no other local or federal income tax audits in progress. In international jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and the UK, which comprise a significant portion of the Company s operations, the years that may be examined vary by country. The Company s most significant foreign subsidiary in Brazil is subject to audit for the calendar years 2011   2015. The Company has identified no new uncertain tax positions during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 for which it is currently likely that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.  
      
  Accounting for income taxes requires estimates of future benefits and tax liabilities. Due to the temporary differences in the timing of recognition of items included in income for accounting and tax purposes, deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities are recorded to reflect the impact arising from these differences on future tax payments. With respect to recorded deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the likelihood that the asset will be realized by addressing the positive and negative evidence to determine whether realization is more likely than not to occur. If realization is in doubt because of uncertainty regarding future profitability, the Company provides a valuation allowance related to the asset to the extent that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Should any significant changes in the tax law or the estimate of the necessary valuation allowance occur, the Company would record the impact of the change, which could have a material effect on the Company s financial position.   
   
  No valuation allowance has been recorded for the Company s domestic deferred tax assets related to temporary differences in items included in taxable income. The Company continues to believe that due to forecasted future taxable income and certain tax planning strategies available, it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the tax benefit provided by those differences. In the U.S., there is a valuation allowance against foreign tax credits to the extent they are limited. In certain other countries where Company operations are in a loss position, the deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences are fully offset by a valuation allowance.   
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 ("ASU 2015-17") regarding ASC Topic 740 "Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." The amendments in ASU 2015-17 eliminate the requirement to bifurcate Deferred Taxes between current and non-current on the balance sheet and requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The amendments for ASU 2015-17 can be applied retrospectively or prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company has  adopted  the new guidance prospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Implementation has no effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations but does result in a change in classification of $4.5 million of deferred tax assets from short-term to long-term.  

Note 9:  Contingencies   
     
  The Company is involved in certain legal matters which arise in the normal course of business. These matters are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  

12

Note 10. Segment Information    
     
  The segment information and the accounting policies of each segment are the same as those described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled  Financial Information by Segment   Geographic Area  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. Our business is aggregated into two reportable segments based on geography of operations: North American Operations and International Operations. Segment income is measured for internal reporting purposes by excluding corporate expenses. Other income and expense, including interest income and expense, and income taxes are excluded entirely from the table below. The restructuring charge of $343,000 is included in the unallocated column. There were no significant changes in the segment operations or in the segment assets from the Annual Report. Financial results for each reportable segment are as follows (in thousands):  

1    Excludes $2,357 of North American segment intercompany sales to the International segment and $3,082 of International segment intercompany sales to the North American segment.  
     
   2    Excludes $1,910 of North American segment intercompany sales to the International segment and $2,262 of International segment intercompany sales to the North American segment.  

ITEM 2.   
   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF   
   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
   Three months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   
     
    Overview    
     
  The Company experienced contrasting revenue and profit performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as North American business declined while International operations rebounded compared to fiscal 2016. North American results were predominately driven by uncertainty in the U.S. economy that impacted both investment in new equipment and demand for the Company s maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products for the manufacturing sector. International business, particularly in Latin America and Europe, made strong gains relative to a weak quarter in fiscal 2016, with minimal impact of currency fluctuations.   
     
  Net sales declined $2.1 million or 4% as $2 million of gross margin erosion and a $0.3 million restructuring charge more than offset a $0.3 million savings in SG A. Net income increased $0.9 million from a loss of $0.2 million or $0.03 per share in fiscal 2016 to income of $0.8 million or $0.11 per share in fiscal 2017.  
     
    Net Sales    
     
  North American sales declined $4.0 million or 12% from $32.4 million in fiscal 2016 to $28.4 million in fiscal 2017 due to a 12% drop in MRO channel sales on precision tools coupled with a 20% decline in capital equipment shipments. International sales increased $1.9 million or 10% from $18.6 million in fiscal 2016 to $20.5 million in fiscal 2017 as the Brazilian economy is recovering from a deep recession and political crisis while the European markets have stabilized. Consolidated currency fluctuations had minimal impact as a strengthening Brazilian Real added a comparative $1.3 million improvement while the weakening British Pound resulted in a $1.2 million decline.  
     
    Gross Margin    
     
  Gross margin declined $2.0 million from $15.9 million in fiscal 2016 to $13.9 million in fiscal 2017. North American fiscal 2017 gross margin of $7.3 million declined $3.0 million compared to fiscal 2016 due to reduced precision tool sales and unfavorable product mix related to lower sales of high margin capital equipment. International gross margins increased $1.0 million to $6.7 million due to increased sales and cost reductions in China and Europe. Currency exchange rates played a minor $0.1 million role in the margin improvement.    

13

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    
     
  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million or 2% with currency accounting for $0.2 million of the savings. North American expenses decreased $0.4 million due to reduced outside sales commissions, as well as lower utility, insurance and bank expenses. International expenses increased $0.1 million as higher selling expense more than offset a $0.2 million reduction related to currency.  
     
    Restructuring charges    
     
  As previously announced, the Company is consolidating its saw manufacturing plants. The $0.3 million restructuring charges represent the costs associated with moving equipment between plants.  
     
    Other Income    
     
  Other income declined $0.1 million principally due to foreign currency translation adjustments.  
     
    Gain on sale of building    
     
  As part of an overall cost reduction plan, the Company closed its Canadian distribution center in May 2016 and sold the building for a $3.0 million net gain in August 2016. Canadian customers will be supplied products from our U. S. distribution centers.  
     
    Income Tax Expense    
     
  The effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 48.6% and 136.9%, respectively. The quarterly tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory rate in fiscal 2017 due to a discrete adjustment of $0.3 million to reflect the impact of a tax rate reduction in the U.K. on deferred tax assets. In fiscal 2016, the tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory rate due to losses in some foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit is recognized.   
     
    Net earnings (loss)    
     
  The Company recorded net earnings of $0.8 million or $0.11 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to net loss of $0.2 million or $0.03 per share in fiscal 2016 as a fiscal 2017 $2.0 million decline in operating income was offset by a $3.0 million gain on the sale of a building.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Net cash increased $1.5 million as proceeds from the sale of the Canadian distribution center of $3.3 million more than offset higher working capital investments. The $0.3 million reduction in cash flow compared to the prior was primarily increased working capital investments.  
     
  The cash balance increased $8.4 million from $12.9 million as of September 30, 2015 to $21.3 million as of September 30, 2016 principally due to the sale of $7.6 million in securities in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Liquidity and Credit Arrangements    
     
  The Company believes it maintains sufficient liquidity and has the resources to fund its operations.  In addition to its cash, the Company maintains a $23 million line of credit in connection with its Loan and Security Agreement, of which, $9.4 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  Availability under the agreement is further reduced by open letters of credit totaling $0.9 million. The Loan and Security Agreement was renewed in January of 2015.  The Loan and Security Agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage, tangible net worth, and interest coverage, and also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, acquisitions, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes, and certain customary events of default.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants related to its Loan and Security Agreement. The Loan and Security Agreement expires on April 30, 2018 and the Company plans to negotiate an extension to the Agreement.  
     
  The effective interest rate on borrowings under the Loan and Security Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was 2.4%.

ITEM 4.             CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
  The Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, and they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
