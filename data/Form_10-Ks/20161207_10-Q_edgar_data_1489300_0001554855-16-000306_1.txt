CAUTIONARY   NOTE   REGARDING   FORWARD-LOOKING    STATEMENTS   
     
   This   Quarterly   Report   on   Form   10-Q    of    Odenza   Corp.,   a   Nevada   corporation   (the    Company ),   contains    forward-looking   statements,    as   defined    in    the   United   States    Private    Securities    Litigation    Reform   Act   of   1995.   In   some   cases,   you   can    identify    forward-looking    statements    by   terminology   such   as     may ,      will ,     should ,    could ,    expects ,    plans ,    intends ,    anticipates ,     believes ,      estimates ,     predicts ,    potential    or    continue    or    the     negative    of   such   terms   and    other    comparable   terminology.   These   forward-looking  statements    include,    without     limitation,     statements    about our market   opportunity, our    strategies,     competition,     expected     activities    and    expenditures    as   we   pursue   our   business   plan,   and    the    adequacy    of    our    available    cash    resources.    Although   we   believe   that   the    expectations    reflected  in  the   forward-looking    statements    are    reasonable,    we   cannot   guarantee future   results,   levels   of    activity,    performance   or   achievements.   Actual    results    may   differ    materially    from    the     predictions    discussed    in    these   forward-looking    statements.    The   economic   environment    within    which   we   operate   could    materially     affect    our   actual    results.     Additional     factors    that    could    materially    affect     these    forward-looking    statements    and/or    predictions    include,   among   other   things:   the    volatility    of   minerals   prices,   the    possibility    that   exploration   efforts   will   not    yield     economically    recoverable    quantities     of    minerals,   accidents   and   other   risks   associated    with    mineral   exploration   and   development   operations,   the    risk    that   the   Company    will    encounter    unanticipated    geological   factors, the   Company s   need    for    and    ability   to     obtain    additional   financing,   the   possibility   that   the   Company   may   not    be    able    to    secure    permitting    and    other    governmental    clearances    necessary    to  carry   out the   Company s   exploration and   development   plans,   other   factors   over   which   we   have    little    or   no   control;   and   other    factors    discussed    in     the    Company s    filings     with    the    Securities    and   Exchange   Commission    ( SEC ).    
     
   Our   management   has    included  projections    and     estimates     in    this   Form   10-Q,   which   are   based    primarily    on   management s   experience    in    the industry,   assessments  of    our    results  of   operations,   discussions   and   negotiations with   third parties  and    a    review  of   information  filed    by   our   competitors    with    the    SEC    or   otherwise    publicly     available.     We    caution   readers   not    to    place   undue   reliance   on    any    such   forward-looking    statements,    which   speak   only   as    of     the    date   made.   We   disclaim   any    obligation    subsequently    to    revise    any    forward-   looking   statements    to     reflect    events   or   circumstances   after   the   date    of    such   statements    or     to     reflect    the   occurrence   of    anticipated     or     unanticipated    events.

   (An   Exploration   Stage   Company)      NOTE     TO     THE     FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   
   OCTOBER   31,   2016     
  (Unaudited)  

BASIS     OF     PRESENTATION   
   
   Unaudited     Interim     Financial     Statements   
     
   These unaudited interim financial statements may not include all information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statement disclosure. However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information contained in the notes to the audited financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2016, included in the Company s Form 10-K and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation and consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments have been made. Operating results for the six months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending January 31, 2017.   

Going     Concern   
     
   These     financial     statements     have     been     prepared     on     a     going     concern     basis.     The     Company     has     incurred     losses     since     inception     resulting     in     an     accumulated     deficit     of     $      172,294      at   October 31  ,     2016     and     further     losses     are     anticipated     in     the     development     of     its     business     raising     substantial     doubt     about     the     Company s     ability     to     continue     as     a     going     concern.     Its     ability     to     continue     as     a     going     concern     is     dependent     upon     the     ability     of     the     Company     to     generate     profitable     operations     in     the     future     and/or     to     obtain     the     necessary   financing     to     meet     its     obligations     and     repay     its   liabilities     arising     from     normal     business     operations     when     they     come     due.   
     
   Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement of its common stock or further director loans as needed. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue.   

Related     Party     Transactions   
     
   Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operational decisions. Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. The due from/to related parties represented the advances from or to the Company s directors. Such advances are non-interest bearing and due upon demand.   

Recent     Accounting     Pronouncements   
     
   Recent pronouncements issued by the FASB or other authoritative accounting standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to the financial statements of the Company.   

Subsequent     Event   
     
   In     accordance     with     ASC   855,     Subsequent     Events,     the     Company     has     evaluated     subsequent     events     through     the     date   of     issuance     of     the     unaudited     interim     financial     statements.     During     this     period,     the     Company     did     not     have     any     material     recognizable     subsequent     events.

  The   following   information    should    be   read    in    conjunction    with    (i)   the    financial    statements   of   Odenza   Corp.,   a   Nevada   corporation   and   exploration    stage    company,   and   the   notes   thereto   appearing    elsewhere     in     this    Form   10-Q   together   with   (ii)   the   more    detailed    business   information   and   the    January  31,   2016   audited    financial    statements    and   related    notes    included     in    the   Company s   most   recent   Annual   Report   on   Form 10-K   for  the     year  ended   January 31,   2016    (File     No.  000-54301), as  filed   with    the    SEC  on    April    25,   2016.  Statements     in    this  section  and   elsewhere    in    this   Form   10-Q   that   are   not    statements     of     historical     or    current   fact   constitute    forward-looking     statements.   
     
  OVERVIEW  
     
  Odenza   Corp.   (the    Company    or    we )   was   incorporated    in     the    State   of   Nevada   on   July   16,   2009   and   has   a    fiscal     year     end     of     January    31.   It  is    an    exploration-stage    Company.  
     
   Going     Concern   
     
  To date the Company has no operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. No revenues are anticipated until we complete the Plan of Operation described in this Form 10-Q and implement our initial business plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  
     
   Our     activities    have  been  financed  primarily  from   the proceeds of    share subscriptions.     From    our  inception   to  October 31,   2016,   we  raised  a    total     of    $31,500   from    private    offerings    of    our   common   stock.  
     
   The    Company   plans    to     raise    additional   funds   through   debt    or    equity   offerings.   There    is     no     guarantee    that   the   Company    will    be   able    to     raise     any     capital     through     this     or     any     other    offerings.  
     
   CRITICAL     ACCOUNTING     POLICIES   
     
  The   discussion   and   analysis   of   our    financial   condition and   results of    operations  are  based   on   our   condensed  consolidated  financial    statements,    which   have   been   prepared    in    accordance    with    accounting    principles     generally    accepted    in    the   United   States   ( US   GAAP ).    The    preparation   of    these    condensed    consolidated     financial     statements    requires    us     to    make    estimates    and   judgments   that   affect   the   reported   amounts   of   assets,    liabilities,    revenues   and   expenses,    and     related     disclosure    of    contingent     assets     and     liabilities.    On   an   ongoing   basis,   we    evaluate    our    estimates    based   on    historical    experience    and    on   various   other   assumptions   that   are    believed     to    be   reasonable   under    the     circumstances,    the    results    of   which   form   the  basis  for   making judgments   about    the    carrying values   of  assets  and  liabilities   that    are   not   readily apparent   from  other    sources.   Actual    results    may   differ   from    these     estimates    under   different   assumptions   or   conditions.   We   have   identified   the   policies   below   as    critical     to    our   business   operations   and    to    the    understanding     of    our    financial    results:  
     
   Basis     of     Presentation   
     
   The    Company   reports   revenues   and   expenses   using   the    accrual     method    of   accounting    in    accordance    with    accounting    principles     generally   accepted     in     the     United    States   ( US   GAAP )   for   financial    and     tax     reporting    purposes.  
     
   Cash     and     Cash     Equivalent   
     
   The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   
     
   Foreign Currency Translation   
     
  The    financial     statements    are   presented    in     United     States    dollars.   In   accordance   with   Accounting    Standards     Codification      ASC    830 ,    Foreign   Currency    Translation ,    foreign   denominated   monetary    assets    and    liabilities    are    translated     to    their    United    States    dollar     equivalents    using   foreign   exchange   rates   which    prevailed    at    the    balance   sheet   date.   Non-monetary    assets    and    liabilities    are   translated   at   exchange   rates    prevailing    at   the   transaction   date.   Revenue    and    expenses    are     translated    at   average   rates   of   exchange   during   the   periods   presented.   Related    translation    adjustments   are   reported   as   a   separate   component   of   stockholders    equity    (deficit),     whereas     gains    or   losses    resulting    from   foreign   currency   transactions   are    included     in     results     of    operations.

Basic     and     Diluted     Net     Loss     Per     Share   
     
   Basic     loss     per     share     includes     no     dilution    and    is    computed    by     dividing     loss     available     to    common   stockholders   by   the    weighted    average   number   of   common   shares    outstanding     for     the    period.    Dilutive     loss    per   share    reflects     the     potential     dilution     of     securities    that    could    share    in     the    losses   of   the   Company.  
     
   Because    the   Company   does   not   have    any     potentially     dilutive     securities,    the   accompanying    presentation     is     only     of     basic     loss     per    share.  
     
   PLAN     OF     OPERATION   
     
  We   are   in   exploration    stage    company   engaged    in    the   business   of   acquiring   mineral   exploration   rights   throughout    Asia,     exploring    for    commercially    producible    quantities  of   minerals,   and    exploiting     any    mineral   deposits   we   discover   that   demonstrate   economic    feasibility.    Since   we are an exploration    stage    company, there    is  no assurance that    commercially     exploitable  reserves of   valuable  minerals  exist  on     any    property   that   we   now   own    or     may     own     in    the   future.   We   will   need    to     do    further   exploration   before   a    final     evaluation     of    the   economic    and    legal    feasibility    of   our   future   exploration    is    determined.  
     
  We    are    presently    seeking     to    acquire    mineral    exploration   rights.   Such   rights    will    likely   be    in    the   form   of   an   option   on   patented   or   unpatented    mineral     claims     prospective     for    precious    metals    or    ore     minerals     in     Asia.    Upon   acquiring   such   mineral    exploration     rights,    we   will   require   financing    to    explore   the   underlying  claims     to    determine    if  they   contain    commercially  producible    quantities    of   precious    metals    or   ore   minerals.   We    will    be   unable    to     estimate    the   cost   of   such    exploration    until   we   know   the    size    and    location    of    the    property land with   underlying   mineral   rights.   We   expect   that   such   exploration   costs    will     typically    consist   of   fees    to     be    paid    for     consulting     services    connected   with   exploration,   the   cost   of   rock   sampling   (the    collection     of    a    series     of    small    chips    over   a    measured    distance,   which    is    then    submitted     for    a   chemical   analysis,   usually    to    determine   the    metallic    content   over   the   sampled   interval,   a   pre-determined    location(s)    on   the   property),   and   cost   of   analyzing    these    samples.    There     is     no    assurance   that   we    will     be    able    to     locate    a    suitable    exploration   property,    or    that    if    we   do,    it    will    contain     commercially    producible   quantities    of    minerals.  
     
  If   we    discover  significant  quantities  of   precious  metals   or    mineral   ores   on  any  property   underlying our   mineral   rights,    we   will    begin  technical    and   economic    feasibility    studies    to    determine    if    we   have   reserves.   We   will   not   be   able    to     estimate    the   cost   of   such    feasibility     studies    until   we   know   the   size   and    location    of   the   property.   We   will    only    consider   developing   a   property    if    we   have   proven    reserves    of   precious    metals    or    mineral    ores   that   can   be   profitably   extracted.  
     
  Any   work   that    would     be    conducted   on   a   property    would     be    conducted   by    unaffiliated    independent    contractors    that   we    will     hire.     The    independent contractors    will    be    responsible    for   surveying,   geology,   engineering,   exploration, and   excavation.    The    professional   engineers   and   geologists   we   engage   will    evaluate    the   information   derived   from   the   exploration    and    excavation,   and   will   advise   us   on   the   economic    feasibility    of   removing    the    mineralized    material.   
     
   Results     of     Operations   
     
   Three - and Nine   - Month     Periods     Ended   October     31  ,     2016     and     2015   
     
   We     recorded    no   revenue   for   the    three    months ended  October  31,   2016   and   2015.   From   the    period     of     July    16,   2009   (inception)    to    October     31,   2016,   we   recorded    no    revenues.  
     
   For   the    three    months   ending    October    31,   2016,   office   and   general   expenses   were   $550,   and   professional   fees   were   $1,500.   For   the  nine    months   ending  October  31,   2016,    office    and   general   expenses   were   $7,630,   and   professional    fees    were   $4,500.   
     
  For   the    three    months   ending  October 31, 2015 ,   office   and   general   expenses   were   $1,247 ,    and   professional   fees   were   $1,500.   For   the  nine    months   ending  October    31,   2015,    office    and   general   expenses   were   $4,541 ,     and    professional   fees   were   $4,500.  
     
   From    the   period   of    July    16,   2009   (inception)    to   October 31 ,   2016,   we   incurred   operating   expenses   of   $172,294.

Liquidity     and     Capital     Resources   
     
  At   October     31,   2016,    we     had    no    cash    balance.   We    do    not   have   sufficient    cash    on   hand    to    fund   our   ongoing   operational   expenses   beyond   12   months.   We   will   need    to     raise    funds    to    commence   our   exploration   program   and   fund   our   ongoing   operational   expenses.    Additional    funding    will     likely    come   from    equity    financing   from   the   sale   of   our   common    stock    or   sale    of     part    of   our    interest     in    our   mineral   claims.   If   we    are    successful  in  completing   an    equity    financing,  existing     shareholders     will    experience  dilution  of    their     interest   in    our   Company.  We    do   not   have   any   financing   arrangement   and   we   cannot   provide   investors   with   any   assurance   that    we    will   be   able    to     raise    sufficient   funding   from   the   sale   of   our   common   stock    to    fund   our    exploration     activities     and    ongoing   operational   expenses.   In   the   absence   of   such   financing,   our   business    will     likely     fail.    There   are   no   assurances   that   we   will   be   able    to    achieve   further    sales    of   our   common   stock   or    any    other   form    of    additional   financing.

   ITEM     3.     QUANTITATIVE     AND     QUALITATIVE     DISCLOSURES     ABOUT     MARKET     RISK.   
     
  As   a  smaller    reporting   company   (as   defined    in    Rule   12b-2   of    the    Exchange   Act),   we    are  not    required     to    provide   the    information     called    for   by    this    Item    3.   
     
   ITEM     4.     CONTROLS     AND     PROCEDURES.   
     
   DISCLOSURE     CONTROLS     AND     PROCEDURES   
     
  Under   the    supervision     and     with    the    participation    of   our   management,   our   principal   executive    officer    and   our   principal    financial     officer     are    responsible   for   conducting   an  evaluation of  the   effectiveness   of   the   design   and   operation   of   our    disclosure    controls   and   procedures,   as defined    in     Rules    13a-15(e)    and    15d-15(e)   under   the    Securities    Exchange   Act   of   1934,   as   of    the     end    of   the   fiscal    period    covered    by     this    report.    Disclosure    controls   and   procedures   means   that   the   material   information   required    to    be    included     in    our    Securities    and   Exchange   Commission   reports    is    recorded,   processed,   summarized   and   reported    within     the     time    periods    specified     in    SEC   rules    and    forms    relating     to    our   company,    including    any   consolidating   subsidiaries,    and    was   made   known    to    us   by   others   within   those    entities,     particularly    during    the    period   when    this    report   was    being    prepared.   Based    on     this     evaluation,    our   principal   executive    officer    and   principal    financial    officer   concluded   as   of    the     evaluation    date    that    our   disclosure   controls   and   procedures   were    effective    as   of  October    31,   2016.  
     
   There    were   no   changes    in    the   Company s    internal    controls   over    financial    reporting   during   the   most   recently   completed    fiscal    quarter   that   have    materially     affected     or    are    reasonably     likely     to     materially    affect   the   Company s   internal   control   over    financial    reporting.

  The   Company    is    not   currently   subject    to    any   legal   proceedings.    From     time     to     time,    the   Company   may   become   subject    to     litigation    or   proceedings    in    connection    with     its    business,   as   either   a    plaintiff    or   defendant.   There    are    no   such   pending   legal   proceedings    to    which    the    Company    is    a   party    that,     in    the   opinion   of   management,    is    likely    to    have   a   material   adverse   effect   on   the   Company s   business,    financial     condition     or     results    of   operations.
