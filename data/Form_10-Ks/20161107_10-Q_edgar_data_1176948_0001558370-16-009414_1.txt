Forward Looking Statements 

This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance. You can identify these forward looking statements by the use of forward looking words such as  outlook,   believes,   expects,   potential,   continues,   may,   will,   should,   seeks,   approximately,   predicts,   intends,   plans,   estimates,   anticipates  or the negative version of those words or other comparable words. The forward looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to us. Such forward looking statements are subject to various risks, and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. Some of these factors are described in this form under the headings  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  Risk Factors.  These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and other cautionary statements that are included in this form and in our other periodic filings. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. 

Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ), we are required to consolidate (a) entities other than limited partnerships and entities similar to limited partnerships in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity, including Ares affiliates and affiliated funds and co investment entities, for which we are presumed to have controlling financial interests, and (b) entities that we concluded are variable interest entities ( VIEs ), including limited partnerships and CLOs, for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the entity in our condensed consolidated financial statements on a gross basis, subject to eliminations from consolidation, including the elimination of the management fees, performance fees and other fees that we earn from the entity. However, the presentation of performance fee compensation and other expenses associated with generating such revenues is not affected by the consolidation process. In addition, as a result of the consolidation process, the net income attributable to third party investors in consolidated entities is presented as net income attributable to redeemable interests and non controlling interests in Consolidated Funds in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

In this form, in addition to presenting our results on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, we present revenues, expenses and other results on a (i)  segment basis,  which deconsolidates these entities and therefore shows the results of our reportable segments without giving effect to the consolidation of the entities and (ii)  Stand Alone basis,  which shows the results of our reportable segments on a combined segment basis together with our Operations Management Group. In addition to our three segments, we have an Operations Management Group (the  OMG ) that consists of five independent, shared resource groups to support our reportable segments by providing infrastructure and administrative support in the areas of accounting/finance, operations/information technology, business development, legal/compliance and human resources. The OMG s expenses are not allocated to our three reportable segments but we consider the cost structure of the OMG when evaluating our financial performance. This information constitutes non GAAP financial information within the meaning of Regulation G, as promulgated by the SEC. Our management uses this information to assess the performance of our reportable segments and our OMG, and we believe that this information enhances the ability of unitholders to analyze our performance. For more information, see  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Consolidation and Deconsolidation of Ares Funds,    Managing Business Performance Non GAAP Financial Measures  and   Segment Analysis ENI and Other Measures.

Table of Contents     

Glossary 

When used in this report, unless the context otherwise requires: 

ARCC Part I Fees  refers to a quarterly performance fee on the investment income from Ares Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: ARCC) ( ARCC )     

Ares Operating Group Unit  or an  AOG Unit  refer to, collectively, a  partnership unit in each of the Ares Operating Group entities.     

assets under management  or  AUM  refers to the assets we manage. For our funds other than CLOs, our AUM represents the sum of the net asset value of such funds, the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund level including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). For our funds that are CLOs, our AUM represents subordinated notes (equity) plus all drawn and undrawn debt tranches;     

CLOs  refers to  our funds  which are structured as collateralized loan obligations;     

Consolidated Funds  refers collectively to certain Ares  affiliated funds, related co investment entities and certain CLOs that are required under GAAP to be consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements;     

distributable earnings  or  DE ,   a non-GAAP measure, is an operating metric that assesses our performance without the effects of our consolidated funds and the impact of unrealized income and expenses, which generally fluctuate with fair value changes. Among other things, this metric also is used to assist in determining amounts potentially available for distribution. However, the declaration, payment, and determination of the amount of distributions to unitholders, if any, is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, which may change our distribution policy at any time.  Distributable earnings is calculated as the sum of Fee Related Earnings, realized performance fees, realized performance fee compensation, realized net investment and other income, and is reduced by expenses arising from transaction costs associated with acquisitions, placement fees and underwriting costs, expenses incurred in connection with corporate reorganization and depreciation. Distributable earnings differs from income before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as it is typically presented before giving effect to unrealized performance fees, unrealized performance fee compensation, unrealized net investment income, amortization of intangibles, and equity compensation expense.  DE is presented prior to the effect of income taxes and to distributions made to our preferred unitholders, unless otherwise noted;       

economic net income  or  ENI ,   a non-GAAP measure, is an operating metric used by management to evaluate total operating performance, a decision tool for deployment of resources, and an assessment of the performance of our business segments.  ENI differs from net income by excluding (a) income tax expense, (b) operating results of our Consolidated Funds, (c) depreciation and amortization expense, (d) the effects of changes arising from corporate actions, and (e) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our total operating performance. Changes arising from corporate actions include equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with mergers and acquisitions and capital transactions, placement fees and underwriting costs and expenses incurred in connection with corporate reorganization;      

fee earning AUM  or  FEAUM  refers to the AUM on which we directly or indirectly earn management fees. Fee earning AUM is equal to the sum of all the individual fee bases of our funds that contribute directly or indirectly to our management fees;     

ii 

Table of Contents     

fee paying AUM  or  FPAUM  refers to the AUM on which we directly earn management fees. Fee paying AUM is equal to the sum of all the individual fee bases of our funds that directly contribute to our management fees;      

fee related earnings  or  FRE ,   a non-GAAP measure, refers to a component of ENI that is used to assess core operating performance by determining whether recurring revenue, primarily consisting of management fees,  is sufficient to cover operating expenses and to generate profits. FRE differs from income before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as it adjusts for the items included in the calculation of ENI and excludes performance fees, performance fee compensation, investment income from our Consolidated Funds and non-consolidated funds and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our performance  ;     

management fees  refers to fees we earn for advisory services provided to our funds, which are generally based on a defined percentage of fair value of assets, total commitments, invested capital, net asset value, net investment income, total assets or par value of the investment portfolios managed by us and also include ARCC Part I Fees that are classified as management fees as they are predictable and recurring in nature, not subject to contingent repayment and generally cash settled each quarter;     

net performance fees  refers to performance fees net of performance fee compensation, which is the portion of the performance fees earned from certain funds that is payable to professionals;     

our funds  refers to the funds, alternative asset companies, co-investment vehicles and other entities and accounts that are managed or co managed by the Ares Operating Group, and which are structured to pay fees. It also includes funds managed by Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of ARCC, and a registered investment adviser;     

performance fees  refers to fees we earn based on the performance of a fund, which are generally based on certain specific hurdle rates as defined in the fund s investment management or partnership agreements and may be either an incentive fee or carried interest;     

performance related earnings  or  PRE ,   a non-GAAP measure, is used to assess our investment performance net of performance fee compensation. PRE differs from income (loss) before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as it only includes performance fees, performance fee compensation and total investment and other income that we earn from our Consolidated Funds and non-consolidated funds;     

Credit Facility  refers to revolving credit facility of the Ares Operating Group;     

SEC  refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission;     

Senior Notes  refers to senior notes of a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Holding;     

Term Loan  refers to term loan of a wholly owned subsidiary of AM LLC;     

Many of the terms used in this report, including AUM, FEAUM, FPAUM, ENI, FRE, PRE and DE, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. In addition, our definitions of AUM and FEAUM and FPAUM are not based on any definition of AUM, FEAUM or FPAUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage and may differ from definitions of AUM set forth in other agreements to which we are a party. Further, ENI, FRE, PRE and DE are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use ENI, FRE, PRE and DE as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. ENI, FRE, PRE and DE should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for operating income, net income, operating cash flows, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The use of ENI, FRE, PRE and DE without consideration of related GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above. Our management compensates for these limitations by using ENI, FRE, PRE and DE as supplemental measures to our GAAP results. We present these measures to provide a more complete understanding of our performance as our management measures it. Amounts and percentages

1. ORGANIZATION   

Ares Management, L.P. (the  Company ), a Delaware limited partnership formed on November 15, 2013, is a leading global alternative asset management firm that operates three distinct but complementary investment groups: the Credit Group,  the Private Equity Group and the Real Estate Group. Information about segments should be read together with Note 14,  Segment Reporting.  Subsidiaries of the Company serve as the general partners and/or investment managers to various investment funds and managed accounts within each investment group (the  Ares Funds ), which are generally organized as pass through entities for income tax purposes. Such subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to the Ares Funds in exchange for management fees. Ares is managed and operated by its general partner, Ares Management GP LLC. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to  Ares  or the  Company  refer to Ares Management, L.P. together with its subsidiaries. 

The Company is a holding partnership, and the Company s sole assets are equity interests in Ares Holdings Inc. ( AHI ), Ares Offshore Holdings, Ltd., and AI Holdco LLC ( AI ). In this quarterly report, the following of the Company s subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the  Ares Operating Group : Ares Offshore Holdings L.P. ( Ares Offshore ), Ares Holdings L.P. ( Ares Holdings ), and Ares Investments L.P. ( Ares Investments ). The Company, indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is the general partner of each of the Ares Operating Group entities. The Company operates and controls all of the businesses and affairs of and conducts all of its material business activities through the Ares Operating Group.  

Non-Controlling Interests in Ares Operating Group Entities 

The non-controlling interests in Ares Operating Group ( AOG ) entities represent a component of equity and net income attributable to the owners of the Ares Operating Group Units ( AOG Units ) that are not held directly or indirectly by the Company. These interests are adjusted for contributions to and distributions from AOG during the reporting period and are allocated income from the AOG entities based on their historical ownership percentage for the proportional number of days in the reporting period. 

Income Allocation 

Income (loss) before taxes is allocated based on each partner s average daily ownership of the AOG entities for each period presented. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned a 38.25% direct interest, or 80,794,582 AOG Units, in each of the AOG entities; Ares Owners Holding L.P. owns a 55.83% direct interest, or 117,933,313 AOG Units, in each of the AOG entities; and an affiliate of Alleghany Corporation (such affiliate,  Alleghany ) owns a 5.92% direct interest, or 12,500,000 AOG Units, in each of the AOG entities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the daily average ownership of AOG Units in each of the AOG entities by the Company, Ares Owners Holding L.P., and Alleghany was 37.98%,  56.14% and 5.88%, respectively. 

Preferred Equity  

In June 2016, the Company issued preferred equity consisting of 12,400,000 units designated as Series A Preferred Equity (the  Preferred Equity ), for a total offering price of $310.0 million. When, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors, distributions on the Preferred Equity are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to 7.00%. The first dividend of $0.544444 per unit of approximately $6.8 million, was declared and paid on September 30, 2016. The Preferred Equity may be redeemed at the Company s option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 30, 2021, at a price of $25.00 per unit. The proceeds, net of expenses, totaling $298.6 million were temporarily used to repay the outstanding balance on the Company s Credit Facility pending consummation of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction (see Note 9). If the ARCC-ACAS Transaction is not consummated, the Company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including for acquisitions and investments and for repayments of borrowings under the Credit Facility.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The condensed consolidated financial statements, including these notes, are unaudited and exclude some of the disclosures required in annual financial statements. Management believes it has made all necessary adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring items) so that the condensed consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and that estimates made in preparing its condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent. The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.  

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and activities of the AOG entities, their consolidated subsidiaries and certain Consolidated Funds.     These Consolidated Funds include certain Ares-affiliated funds, related co-investment entities and collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ) (collectively, the  Consolidated Funds ) managed by Ares Management LLC ( AM LLC ) and its wholly owned subsidiaries that have been consolidated pursuant to GAAP. Including the results of the Consolidated Funds significantly increases the reported amounts of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements; however, the Consolidated Funds results included herein have no direct effect on the net income attributable to controlling interests or on total controlling equity. Instead, economic ownership interests of the investors in the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Further, cash flows allocable to non-controlling interest in Consolidated Funds are specifically identifiable in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation  . 

The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current presentation.    

Equity Appropriated for Consolidated Funds and Adoption of ASU 2014-13 

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-13,   Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity  .   The Company applied the guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment of $3.4 million to equity appropriated for Consolidated Funds as of January 1, 2016. 

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-13, the Company elected the fair value option for eligible liabilities to mitigate the accounting mismatch between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of its consolidated CLOs. As a result, the Company accounted for the excess of fair value of assets over liabilities as an increase in equity appropriated for Consolidated Funds.  

Pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2014-13, the Company is required to determine whether the fair values of the financial assets or financial liabilities are more observable. B  eginning January 1, 2016, the Company has determined that the fair value of the financial assets of the consolidated CLOs, which are mostly Level II assets within the GAAP fair value hierarchy, are more observable than the fair value of the financial liabilities of its consolidated CLOs, which are mostly Level III liabilities.   As a result,   the financial assets of consolidated CLOs are measured at fair value and   the financial liabilities   of the consolidated CLOs are   measured in consolidation as: (1) the sum of the fair value of the financial assets, and the carrying value of any nonfinancial assets held temporarily, less (2) the sum of the fair value of any beneficial interests retained by the Company (other than those that represent compensation for services), and the Company s carrying

value of any beneficial interests that represent compensation for services. The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial liabilities (other than the beneficial interests retained by the Company). 

Equity Compensation 

Forfeitures 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  .     In accordance with ASU 2016-09,     the Company elected to recognize share-based award forfeitures in the period they occur as a reversal of previously recognized compensation expense. The reduction in compensation expense is determined based on the specific awards forfeited during that period. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company applied an estimated forfeiture rate as a reduction of current period equity compensation expense.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU provides alternative methods of adoption. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from     Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date.    ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after that date and permits early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued additional ASUs clarifying certain aspects of ASU 2014-09. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 was not changed by the additional guidance.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The objective of the guidance in ASU 2016-01 is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide more decision-useful information. ASU 2016-01 requires an entity to carry all of its investments in equity securities at fair value, and to recognize periodic changes of that fair value in income. This guidance excludes equity method investments, investments that result in the consolidation of the investee and investments for which the entity has elected the practicability exception to the fair value measurement requirements. The guidance should be applied using a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance becomes effective. ASU 2016-01 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those reporting periods. The Company does not believe this guidance will have a material impact on its  condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   The objective of the guidance in ASU 2016-02 is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and disclosing key information. ASU 2016-02 amends previous lease guidance, which required a lessee to categorize and account for leases as either operating leases or capital leases, and instead requires a lessee to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the entity s balance sheet for all leases with terms that exceed one year. The lease liability and right-of-use asset are to be carried at the present value of remaining expected future lease payments. The guidance should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated

financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323).   ASU 2016-07 removes the requirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting for an investment that becomes eligible for the equity method due to an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The investment should be accounted for as an equity method investment as of the date that it becomes qualified for such treatment. At this date, any unrealized holding gain (loss), if the investment was an available-for-sale equity security, should be recognized in earnings. ASU 2016-07 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations.   The objective of the guidance in ASU 2016-08 is to provide clarity on the application of the current principal versus agent guidance. ASU 2016-08 clarifies how an entity should determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent for each specified good or service promised to a customer and how to determine the nature of each specified good or service. The effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2016-08 are the same as that of ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

During the second quarter of 2016, two ASUs: ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing;   and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , were issued to provide clarification to previously issued revenue recognition guidance (ASU 2014-09) that has not yet been implemented. The two updates are required to be adopted with ASU 2014-09, but are not expected to change its application by the Company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The objective of the guidance in ASU 2016-13 is to allow entities to recognize estimated credit losses in the period that the change in valuation occurs. ASU 2016-13 requires an entity to present financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis on the balance sheet net of an allowance for credit losses. Available for sale and held to maturity debt securities are also required to be held net of an allowance for credit losses. The guidance should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual and quarterly reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not believe this guidance will have a material impact on its  condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .     The objective of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce diversity in practice among public entities. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the appropriate cash flow classification(s) for certain cash receipts or payments made by an entity, including: debt prepayment, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from insurance claims, proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions from equity method investees, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. It also confirms the proper treatment of cash receipts or payments that have aspects of more than one type of cash flow. The guidance should be applied using a retrospective approach. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe this guidance will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

Based on the Company s ability and intent to hold the investments until maturity and the underlying credit performance, the Company has determined that the net unrealized losses are temporary impairments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

There were no sales of held-to-maturity investments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .    All contractual maturities are greater than 10 years as of September 30, 2016. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because underlying collateral may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

5. FAIR VALUE 

GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework prioritizing the inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value into three levels based on their market observability. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of instrument and the characteristics specific to the instrument. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices from an active market or where fair value can be measured based on actively quoted prices generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. 

Financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified as follows: 

Level I   Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.      

Level II   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets; and model derived valuations with directly or indirectly observable significant inputs. Level II inputs include prices in markets with few transactions, non-current prices that are not current, prices for which little public information exists or prices that vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers. Other inputs include interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment risks, loss severities, credit risks and default rates.      

Level III   Valuations that rely on one or more significant unobservable inputs. These inputs reflect the Company s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use to value the instrument based on the best information available.  In some instances, an instrument may fall into more than one level of the fair value hierarchy. In such instances, the instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest of the three levels (with Level III being the lowest) that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of an input requires judgment and considers factors specific to the instrument.

Represents investment in Consolidated Funds that were deconsolidated during the period.      

The Company recognizes transfers between the levels as of the beginning of the period. Transfers out of Level III were generally attributable to certain investments that experienced a more significant level of market activity during the period and thus were valued using observable inputs either from independent pricing services or multiple brokers. Transfers into Level III were generally attributable to certain investments that experienced a less significant level of market activity during the period and thus were only able to obtain one or fewer quotes from a broker or independent pricing service. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers between Level I and Level II.   

The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Level III liabilities for the CLO loan obligations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Upon adoption of ASU 2014-13, the debt obligations of consolidated CLOs are no longer considered Level III financial liabilities under the GAAP fair value hierarchy. As of January 1, 2016, the debt obligations of consolidated CLOs are measured on the basis of the fair value of the financial assets of the CLO and are classified as Level II financial liabilities.

6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

In the normal course of business, the Company and the Consolidated Funds are exposed to certain risks relating to their ongoing operations and use various types of derivative instruments primarily to mitigate against credit and foreign exchange risk. The derivative instruments used by the Company and Consolidated Funds include warrants, currency options, interest rate swaps, total return swaps and forward contracts. The derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition with changes in value presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Quantitative Disclosures of Derivative Financial Instruments 

The following tables identify the fair value and notional amounts of derivative contracts by major product type on a gross basis for the Company and the Consolidated Funds as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These amounts may be offset (to the extent that there is a legal right to offset) and presented on a net basis in either other assets or accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition:

7. DEBT 

The following table summarizes the Company s and its subsidiaries  debt obligations: 

(1) 

The AOG entities are borrowers under the Credit Facility, which provides a $1.03 billion revolving line of credit with the ability to upsize to $1.28 billion (subject to obtaining commitments for any such additional borrowing capacity). It has a variable interest rate based on either LIBOR or a base rate plus an applicable margin with an unused commitment fee paid quarterly, which is subject to change with the Company s underlying credit agency rating. Currently, base rate loans bear interest calculated based on the base rate plus 0.75% and the LIBOR rate loans bear interest calculated based on LIBOR plus 1.75%. The unused commitment fee is 0.25% per annum. There is a base rate and LIBOR floor of zero.     

(2) 

The Senior Notes were issued in October 2014 by Ares Finance Co. LLC ( AFC ), a subsidiary of the Company, at 98.268% of the face amount with interest paid semi-annually. The Company may redeem the Senior Notes prior to maturity, subject to the terms of the indenture.     

(3) 

In connection with risk retention requirements, the Term Loan was entered into in August 2015 by a subsidiary of the Company that acts as a manager to a CLO. The Term Loan is secured by collateral in the form of CLO senior tranches owned by the Company. To the extent the assets are not sufficient to cover the Term Loan, there is no further recourse to the Company to fund or repay the remaining balance. Interest is paid quarterly, and the Company also pays a fee of 0.025% of a maximum investment amount.      

Debt obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries are reflected at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of September 30, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility, Senior Notes and Term Loan obligations.    

The Company typically incurs and pays debt issuance costs when entering into a new debt obligation. Debt issuance costs may be recorded as a reduction of the corresponding debt obligation and are amortized over the term of the obligation. In connection with amending the terms of the Credit Facility, new debt issuance costs of approximately $0.6 million were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The unamortized portion of the Credit Facility s debt issuance costs of $5.3 million and $6.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, is included in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The unamortized portion of the Senior Notes and Term Loan debt issuance costs of $2.1 million and $2.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, is included in the net carrying value of the Company s debt obligations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.7 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and is included in net interest and investment income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Loan Obligations of the Consolidated CLOs  

Loan obligations of the Consolidated Funds that are CLOs ("Consolidated CLOs") represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the Consolidated CLOs. The Company measures the loan obligations of the consolidated CLOs   using the fair value of the financial assets of its consolidated CLOs.   Several of the Consolidated CLOs issued preferred shares representing the subordinated interests that are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity dates of the senior secured loan obligations. As a result, these shares have been classified as liabilities and are included in CLO loan obligations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

(Dollars in Thousands, Except Unit Data and as Otherwise Noted) 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following loan obligations were outstanding and classified as liabilities of the Company s Consolidated CLOs: 

(2) 

Original borrowings under the subordinated notes totaled $238.7 million, with various maturity dates ranging from October 2024 to July 2028. They do not have contractual interest rates, but instead receive distributions from the excess cash flows generated by each Consolidated CLO.     

Loan obligations of the Consolidated CLOs are collateralized by the assets held by the Consolidated CLOs, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other securities. The assets of one Consolidated CLO may not be used to satisfy the liabilities of another Consolidated CLO. Loan obligations of the Consolidated CLOs include floating rate notes, deferrable floating rate notes, revolving lines of credit and subordinated notes. Amounts borrowed under the notes are repaid based on available cash flows subject to priority of payments under each Consolidated CLO s governing documents. Based on the terms of these facilities, the creditors of the facilities have no recourse to the Company. 

Credit Facilities of the Consolidated Funds 

Certain Consolidated Funds maintain credit facilities to fund investments between capital drawdowns. These facilities generally are collateralized by the unfunded capital commitments of the Consolidated Funds  limited partners, bear an annual commitment fee based on unfunded commitments and contain various affirmative and negative covenants and reporting obligations, including restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, margin stock, affiliate transactions, dividends and distributions, release of capital commitments and portfolio asset dispositions. The creditors of these facilities have no recourse to the Company. Credit facilities of the Consolidated Funds are reflected at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Consolidated Funds were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants under such credit facilities.  

The Consolidated Funds had the following revolving bank credit facilities outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(1) 

The fair values of the borrowings approximate the carrying value, as the interest rate on the borrowings is a floating rate.

8. REDEEMABLE INTERESTS 

The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the redeemable interests in the AOG entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Upon acquisition of Indicus Advisors, LLP ( Indicus ) in November 2011, certain former owners of Indicus ( Former Owners ) were provided a put option on their equity interest at a strike price of $40 million to be exercised during 2016 ( Fixed Price Put Option ), among other consideration. In August 2016, the Former Owners  exercised their Fixed Price Put Option. The Company expects to make a payment of $40 million to settle this option in November 2016. At the time of payment to settle the option, an increase in tax basis will occur and a liability will be recorded for the Company s obligations under the tax receivable agreement ( TRA ) with respect to tax savings that result from the amortization expected from the increased basis. 

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Indemnification Arrangements  

Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain indemnities for affiliates of the Company, persons acting on behalf of the Company or such affiliates and third parties. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be determined and have not been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Capital Commitments  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had aggregate unfunded commitments of $598.4 million and $436.4 million, respectively, including commitments to both non-consolidated funds and Consolidated Funds.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $33.3 million in unfunded commitments to invest in certain funds managed by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, L.P.  

ARCC and   American Capital, Ltd. Merger Agreement 

On May 23, 2016, ARCC and American Capital, Ltd. ( ACAS ) entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which ARCC will acquire ACAS in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $4.0 billion (the "ARCC-ACAS Transaction"). To support the ARCC-ACAS Transaction, the Company, through its subsidiary Ares Capital Management LLC, which serves as the investment adviser to ARCC, will (i) provide approximately $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of ACAS common stock, payable to ACAS shareholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement at the closing of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction and (ii) waive, for

each of the first ten calendar quarters beginning with the first full calendar quarter after the closing of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction, the lesser of (x) $10 million of ARCC Part I Fees and (y) the amount of ARCC Part I Fees for such quarter, in each case, to the extent earned and payable by ARCC in such quarter (collectively, the "Transaction Support"). 

The Transaction Support is conditioned upon completion of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction. While there can be no assurances as to the exact timing, or that the ARCC-ACAS Transaction will be completed at all, the ARCC-ACAS Transaction is expected to be completed as early as the first week of January 2017. The completion of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, ACAS and ARCC shareholder approvals, required regulatory approvals, receipt of certain third party consents and other customary closing conditions.    

Guarantees  

On July 30, 2014, AM LLC agreed to provide credit support to a $75.0 million credit facility (the  Guaranteed Facility ), entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (NYSE: ACRE) ( ACRE ) with a national banking association. The Guaranteed Facility was extended through September 30, 2016, at which time the credit facility was repaid and the Guaranteed Facility expired. 

In connection with the acquisition of Energy Investors Funds ( EIF ), contingent consideration is payable to EIF s former membership interest holders if certain funds and co-investment vehicles meet certain revenue and fee paying commitment targets. The fair value of the liability for contingent consideration is subject to change until the liability is settled with the related impact recorded to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within other income (expense), net. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reduced its contingent consideration liability, resulting in a gain of $17.7 million for the period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability was $20.5 million and $38.1 million, respectively.  

Performance Fees  

Generally, if at the termination of a fund (and increasingly at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, the Company will be obligated to repay carried interest that was received by the Company in excess of the amounts to which the Company is entitled. This contingent obligation is normally reduced by income taxes paid by the Company related to its carried interest.  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, if the Company assumed all existing investments were worthless, the amount of performance fees subject to potential repayment, net of tax, which may differ from the recognition of revenue, would have been approximately $366.1 million and $322.2 million, respectively, of which approximately $283.0 million and $247.9 million, respectively, is reimbursable to the Company by certain professionals. Management believes the possibility of all of the investments becoming worthless is remote. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, if the funds were liquidated at their fair values, there would be no repayment obligation, and accordingly, the Company did not record a contingent repayment liability as of either date.  

Litigation 

From time to time, the Company is named as a defendant in legal actions relating to transactions conducted in the ordinary course of business. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such legal actions, in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

Substantially all of the Company s revenue is earned from its affiliates, including management fees, performance fees, administrative expense reimbursements and service fees. The related accounts receivable are included within due from affiliates on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, except that performance fees receivable, which are entirely due from affiliated funds, are presented separately within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

The Company has investment management agreements with various funds and accounts that it manages. In accordance with these agreements, the Consolidated Funds bear certain operating costs and expenses, which are initially paid by the Company and subsequently reimbursed by the Consolidated Funds. In addition, the Company has agreements to provide administrative services to various entities. 

The Company also has entered into agreements with related parties to be reimbursed for providing administrative services, including ARCC, ACRE, Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund, Inc. ( ARDC ), Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., European Senior Secured Loan Programme S. .r.l. and ACF FinCo I L.P. 

Employees and other related parties may be permitted to participate in co investment vehicles that generally invest in Ares funds alongside fund investors. Participation is limited by law to individuals who qualify under applicable securities laws. These co investment vehicles generally do not require these individuals to pay management or performance fees. 

Performance fees from the funds can be distributed to professionals on a current basis, subject to repayment by the subsidiary of the Company that acts as general partner of the relevant fund in the event that certain specified return thresholds are not ultimately achieved. The professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, the obligations of these subsidiaries in respect of this general partner obligation. Such guarantees are several, and not joint, and are limited to distributions received by the relevant recipient. 

The Company considers its professionals and non consolidated funds to be affiliates. Amounts due from and to affiliates were comprised of the following: 

Due from Ares Funds and Portfolio Companies 

In the normal course of business, the Company pays certain expenses on behalf of Consolidated Funds and

non consolidated funds for which it is reimbursed. Amounts advanced on behalf of Consolidated Funds are eliminated in consolidation. Certain expenses initially paid by the Company, primarily professional services, travel and other costs associated with particular portfolio company holdings are subject to reimbursement by the portfolio companies. 

11. INCOME TAXES 

A substantial portion of the Company s earnings flow through to owners of the Company without being subject to entity level income taxes. Consequently, a significant portion of the Company s earnings reflects no provision for income taxes except those for foreign, state, city and local income taxes incurred at the entity level. A portion of the Company s operations is held through AHI, as well as corporate subsidiaries of Ares Investments, which are U.S. corporations for tax purposes. AHI is subject to U.S. corporate tax on earnings that flow through from Ares Holdings with respect to both AOG Units and preferred units. The income of these U.S. corporations is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and certain of its foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign income taxes (for which a foreign tax credit can generally offset U.S. corporate taxes imposed on the same income). The Company s income tax provision includes corporate level income taxes and entity level income taxes, as well as income taxes incurred by certain affiliated funds that are consolidated in these financial statements. The Company s income tax expense was   $  7.6   million     and $5.6   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $7.9 million and $15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The Company s effective income tax rate is dependent on many factors, including the estimated nature of many amounts and the mix of revenues and expenses between U.S. corporate subsidiaries that are subject to income taxes and those subsidiaries that are not. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has utilized the discrete effective tax rate method to calculate its interim income tax provision. The discrete method is applied when the application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year to date period as if it was the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. Additionally, the Company s effective tax rate is influenced by the amount of income tax provision recorded for any affiliated funds that are consolidated in these financial statements. Consequently, the effective income tax rate is subject to significant variation from period to period. 

The Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2013 through 2016 are open under the normal statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination. State and local tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2012 to 2016. Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2010 to 2016. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company does not believe the outcome of any future audit will have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

12. EARNINGS PER COMMON UNIT 

Basic earnings per common unit is computed by dividing income available to common unitholders by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common unit is computed using the more dilutive method of either the two-class method or the treasury stock method. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the treasury stock method was the more dilutive method for the unvested restricted units and no participating securities had rights to undistributed earnings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the two-class method was the more dilutive method for the unvested restricted units. The computation of diluted earnings per common unit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes the following options, restricted units and AOG Units, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

13. EQUITY COMPENSATION 

Ares Management, L.P. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan 

In 2014, the Company adopted its Equity Incentive Plan, under which the Company granted options to acquire 24,835,227 common units, 4,936,051 restricted units to be settled in common units and 686,395 phantom common units to be settled in cash. Based on a formula as defined in the Equity Incentive Plan, the total number of units available to be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan resets and increases on January 1 each year. Accordingly, on January 1, 2016, the total number of units available for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan increased to 31,962,710 units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a total of 1,567,837 units and unit options, net of forfeitures and vesting, were issued and 30,394,893 units remain available to be issued as of September 30, 2016.

Equity based compensation expense, net of forfeitures is included in the following table: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 1,772,865  net options were forfeited.  

Restricted Units 

Each restricted unit represents an unfunded, unsecured right of the holder to receive a common unit on a specific date. The restricted units generally vest and are settled in common units either (i) at a rate of one third per year, beginning on the third anniversary of the grant date, (ii) in their entirety on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, or (iii) at a rate of one-quarter per year, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense associated with restricted units is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award.   

The holders of restricted units generally have the right to receive as current compensation an amount in cash equal to (i) the amount of any distribution paid with respect to a common unit multiplied by (ii) the number of restricted units held at the time such distributions are declared ( Distribution Equivalent ). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Distribution Equivalents were made to the holders of restricted units in the amount of $2.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, which are presented as distributions within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity until forfeited, at which time the cumulative payments are reclassified to compensation and benefits expense.  

The following table presents unvested restricted units  activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The total compensation expense expected to be recognized in all future periods associated with the restricted units is approximately $90.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 3.29 years.

14. SEGMENT REPORTING 

The Company operates through its distinct operating segments. In 2016, the Company revised its reportable segments by combining two of its segments into a single segment to reflect a change in how the Company is managed. The previously disclosed Tradable Credit Group segment and the Direct Lending Group segment have been combined into a single Credit Group segment. This change was made to more effectively manage the Company s broad array of credit products and to better position the Credit Group to capitalize on future growth opportunities. In addition, in the third quarter of 2016 the Company moved its Special Situations strategy from the Credit Group to the Private Equity Group to better align the segment presentation with how the investment strategies for the Special Situations funds are managed. The Company has modified historical results to conform with its current presentation.  

The Company s three revised operating segments are: 

Credit Group:   The Company s Credit Group is a leading manager of credit strategies across the non-investment grade credit universe in the U.S. and Europe, with approximately $62.0 billion of assets under management and 135 funds as of September 30, 2016. The Credit Group offers a range of credit strategies across the liquid and illiquid spectrum, including syndicated loans, high yield bonds, credit opportunities, structured credit investments and U.S. and European direct lending. The Credit Group provides solutions for traditional fixed income investors seeking to access the syndicated loans and high yield bond markets and capitalizes on opportunities across traded corporate credit. It additionally provides investors access to directly originated fixed and floating rate credit assets and the ability to capitalize on illiquidity premiums across the credit spectrum. The Credit Group s syndicated loans strategy (formerly known as the bank loan strategy) focuses on liquid, traded non-investment grade secured loans to corporate issuers. The high yield bond strategy seeks to deliver a diversified portfolio of liquid, traded non-investment grade corporate bonds, including secured, unsecured and subordinated debt instruments. Credit opportunities is a  go anywhere  strategy seeking to capitalize on market inefficiencies and relative value opportunities across the capital structure. The structured credit strategy (formerly known as the asset-backed strategy) invests across the capital structures of syndicated collateralized loan obligation vehicles (CLOs) and in directly-originated asset-backed instruments comprised of diversified portfolios of consumer and commercial assets. The Company is one of the largest self-originating direct lenders to the U.S. and European middle markets, providing one-stop financing solutions for small-to-medium sized companies, which the Company believes are increasingly underserved by traditional lenders. The Credit Group conducts its U.S. corporate lending activities primarily through ARCC, the largest business development company as of June 30, 2016, by both market capitalization and total assets. In addition, the Credit Group manages a commercial finance business that provides asset-based and cash flow loans to small and middle-market companies, as well as asset-based facilities to specialty finance companies. The Credit Group s European direct lending platform is one of the most significant participants in the European middle-market, focusing on self-originated investments in illiquid middle-market credits.     

Private Equity Group:    The Company s Private Equity Group has approximately $24.9 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2016, broadly categorizing its investment strategies as corporate private equity, U.S. power and energy infrastructure and special situations (formerly part of the Credit Group). The group manages five corporate private equity commingled funds focused on North America and Europe and one focused on greater China, five commingled funds and six related co-investment vehicles focused on U.S. power and energy infrastructure and five special situations funds as of September 30, 2016. In its North American and European flexible capital strategy, the Company targets opportunistic majority or shared-control investments in businesses with strong franchises and attractive growth opportunities in North America and Europe. The U.S. power and energy infrastructure strategy targets U.S. energy infrastructure-related assets across the power generation, transmission and midstream sectors, seeking attractive risk-adjusted equity returns with current cash flow and capital appreciation. The special situations strategy seeks to invest opportunistically across a broad spectrum of distressed or mispriced investments, including corporate debt, rescue capital, private asset-backed investments, post-reorganization securities and non-performing portfolios.

(Dollars in Thousands, Except Unit Data and as Otherwise Noted) 

Real Estate Group:    The Company s Real Estate Group manages comprehensive public and private equity and debt strategies, with approximately $10.4 billion of assets under management across 46 funds as of September 30, 2016.  Real Estate equity strategies focus on applying hands-on value creation initiatives to mismanaged and capital-starved assets, as well as new development, ultimately selling stabilized assets back into the market. The Real Estate Group manages both a value-add strategy and an opportunistic strategy.  The value-add strategy seeks to create value by buying assets at attractive valuations and through active asset management of income-producing property types across the U.S. and Western Europe. The opportunistic strategy focuses on manufacturing core assets through development, redevelopment and fixing distressed capital structures across major property types in the U.S. and Europe.  The Company s debt strategies leverage the Real Estate Group s diverse sources of capital to directly originate and manage commercial mortgage investments on properties that range from stabilized to requiring hands-on value creation.  In addition to managing private debt funds, the Real Estate Group makes debt investments through a publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT, ACRE.       

The Company has an Operations Management Group (the  OMG ) that consists of five shared resource groups to support the Company s operating segments by providing infrastructure and administrative support in the areas of accounting/finance, operations/information technology, business development, legal/compliance and human resources. Additionally, the OMG provides services to certain of the Company s investment companies and partnerships, which reimburse the OMG for expenses equal to the costs of services provided. The OMG s expenses are not allocated to the Company s three reportable segments but the Company does consider the cost structure of the OMG when evaluating its financial performance. 

Economic net income ( ENI ), a non-GAAP measure, is an operating metric used by management to evaluate total operating performance, a decision tool for deployment of resources, and an assessment of the performance of the Company s business segments. ENI differs from net income by excluding (a) income tax expense, (b) operating results of the Consolidated Funds, (c) depreciation and amortization expense, (d) placement fees and underwriting costs (e) the effects of changes arising from corporate actions, and (f) certain other items that the Company believes are not indicative of its total operating performance. Changes arising from corporate actions include equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with mergers and acquisitions and capital transactions, and expenses incurred in connection with corporate reorganization.   

Fee related earnings ( FRE ), a non-GAAP measure, refers to a component of ENI that is used to assess core operating performance by determining whether recurring revenue, primarily consisting of management fees,  is sufficient to cover operating expenses and to generate profits. FRE differs from income before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as it adjusts for the items included in the calculation of ENI and excludes performance fees, performance fee compensation, investment income from the Consolidated Funds and non-consolidated funds and certain other items that the Company believes are not indicative its performance.  

Performance related earnings ( PRE ), a non-GAAP measure, is used to assess the Company s investment performance net of performance fee compensation. PRE differs from income (loss) before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as it only includes performance fees, performance fee compensation and total investment and other income earned from the Consolidated Funds and non-consolidated funds. 

Distributable earnings ( DE ), a non-GAAP measure, is an operating metric that assesses the Company s performance without the effects of the Consolidated Funds and the impact of unrealized income and expenses, which generally fluctuate with fair value changes. Among other things, this metric also is used to assist in determining amounts potentially available for distribution. However, the declaration, payment, and determination of the amount of distributions to unitholders, if any, is at the sole discretion of the Company s Board of Directors, which may change the distribution policy at any time. Distributable earnings is calculated as the sum of fee related earnings, realized performance fees, realized performance fee compensation, realized net investment and other income, and is reduced by expenses arising from transaction costs associated with acquisitions, placement fees and underwriting costs, expenses incurred in connection with corporate reorganization and depreciation. Distributable earnings differs from income before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as it is typically presented before giving effect to unrealized performance fees, unrealized performance fee compensation, unrealized net investment income, amortization of intangibles, and equity compensation expense. DE is

presented prior to the effect of income taxes and to distributions made to the Company s preferred unitholders, unless otherwise noted. 

These measures supplement and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Management makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of each of the Company s business segments based on financial and operating metrics and other data that is presented before giving effect to the consolidation of any of the Consolidated Funds. Consequently, all segment data excludes the assets, liabilities and operating results related to the Consolidated Funds and non consolidated funds.

15. CONSOLIDATION 

Investments in Consolidated Variable Interest Entities     

The Company consolidates entities that the Company has a variable interest in, and as the general partner or investment manager, has both the power to direct the most significant activities and a potentially significant economic interest. Investments in the consolidated VIEs are reported at their carrying value, which approximates fair value, and represents the Company s maximum exposure to loss. 

Investments in Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 

The Company holds interests in certain VIEs that are not consolidated as the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company's interest in such entities generally is in the form of direct equity interests, fixed fee arrangements or both. The maximum exposure to loss represents the potential loss of assets by the Company relating to these non-consolidated entities. Investments in the non-consolidated VIEs are held at their carrying value, which approximates fair value.  

The Company's interests and the Consolidated Funds' interests in consolidated and non-consolidated VIEs, as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and their respective maximum exposure to loss relating to non-consolidated VIEs (excluding fixed arrangements) are as follows:

Our Business 

We are a leading global alternative asset manager that operates through distinct but complementary investment groups, which are our reportable segments. In 2016, we revised our reportable segments by combining two of our segments into a single segment to reflect a change in how we manage our operations. The previously disclosed Tradable Credit Group segment and the Direct Lending Group segment have been combined into a single Credit Group segment. This change was made in order to manage our broad array of credit products in a more effective manner and to better position the Credit Group to capitalize on future growth opportunities. In addition, in the third quarter of 2016 we reclassified our Special Situations strategy from the Credit Group to the Private Equity Group to better align our segment presentation with how the investment strategies for the Special Situations funds are managed. We have presented our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 to conform to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 presentation. 

Our reportable segments are Credit Group, Private Equity Group and Real Estate Group. For a detailed description of our reportable segments, see Note 14,  Segment Reporting,  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 

The focus of our business model is to provide our investment management capabilities through various funds and products that meet the needs of a wide range of institutional and retail investors. Our revenues consist primarily of management fees and performance fees, as well as investment income and administrative expense reimbursements. Management fees are generally based on a defined percentage of average fair value of assets, total commitments, invested capital, net asset value, net investment income or par value of the investment portfolios we manage. Performance fees are based on certain specific hurdle rates as defined in the funds  applicable investment management or partnership agreements and represent either an incentive fee or carried interest. Other income (expense) represents the investment income, realized gains (losses) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) resulting from the investments of the Company and the Consolidated Funds, as well as interest expense. We provide administrative services to certain of our affiliated funds that are presented within administrative and other fees for GAAP reporting, but are presented net of respective expenses for segment reporting purposes. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to consolidate those funds in which we hold a significant economic interest and substantive control rights. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a combined segment basis, which shows the results of our reportable segments without giving effect to the consolidation of the funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues consist of management fees, other income, as well as realized and unrealized performance fees, and net investment income. Our segment expenses consist of compensation and benefits, net of administrative fees, general, administrative and other expenses, net of administrative fees, as well as realized and unrealized performance fee compensation.

Trends Affecting Our Business 

We believe that our disciplined investment philosophy across our three distinct but complementary investment groups contributes to the stability of our firm s performance throughout market cycles. Additionally, as approximately 76% of our assets under management were in funds with a contractual life of three years or more and approximately 51% were in funds with a contractual life of seven years or more as of September 30, 2016,     our funds have a stable base of committed capital enabling us to invest in assets with a long term focus over different points in a market cycle and to take advantage of market volatility. However, our results of operations, including the fair value of our AUM, are affected by a variety of factors, including conditions in the global financial markets and the economic and political environments, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. 

Despite growing fundamental and macroeconomic uncertainties, the broad-based rally that began in mid-February continued through the third quarter of 2016 as the leveraged finance market generally benefited from increased demand for credit, accommodative monetary policies from central banks, and rising commodity prices. Amid falling sovereign yields and compressing spreads, investors continued to seek out higher yields throughout the quarter and boosted investor enthusiasm for risk assets globally, supporting non-investment grade credit asset prices. High yield bonds posted strong returns during the third quarter of 2016 with the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index ( H0A0 ) increasing 5.50%, extending the index s total return since mid-February (when oil prices bottomed) to 21.57%. Leveraged loans fared similarly, with the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index ( CSLLI ) increasing 3.10% during the third quarter of 2016. For the year-to-date period through September 30, the H0A0 and CSLLI returned 15.32% and 7.46%, respectively, versus returns of negative 2.53% and 1.61% for the same period last year. Despite concerns over the slow pace of global growth and declining corporate earnings, the equity markets rallied with the S P 500 returning 3.86% for the third quarter and 7.84% year-to-date through September 30, 2016.   

European markets showed notable stability during the third quarter of 2016 as the initial fallout from  Brexit  was less severe than feared. Accommodative monetary action by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) continued to act as an overriding support mechanism. However, in September the President of the ECB implied that the ECB was hesitant to add to its existing stimulus efforts. Markets initially reacted negatively to the announcement and as a result, the European high yield index posted a negative return in September. Strong returns in July and August offset September performance and the Merrill Lynch European High Yield Index increased 3.46% and the Credit Suisse Western European Leveraged Loan Index was up 3.18% for the quarter, contributing to year-to-date September 30, 2016 returns of 7.12% and 6.17%, respectively. Looking forward, there is significant uncertainty as a result of a number of factors: low growth across several larger economies in Europe, the impact of the U.K. s exit from the E.U., including renegotiation of all trade agreements as well as its political relationship with the E.U., and speculation that other members of the E.U. might opt to assert greater distance from it.  In the short term, we expect market volatility in both credit and equities to remain elevated for the fourth quarter of 2016 and potentially beyond. 

For our businesses, these markets and economies have created opportunities, particularly for the Credit Group s direct lending and liquid alternative credit strategies, which utilize flexible investment mandates to manage portfolios through market cycles. As market conditions shift and default risk and interest rate risk come under greater focus, having the ability to move up and down the capital structure enables the Credit Group to reduce risk and enhance returns as market conditions shift. Similarly, given our broad capabilities in leveraged loans, such flexibility enables our Credit Group to reduce sensitivities to changing interest rates by increasing allocations to floating rate leveraged loans. On a market value basis, approximately 77% of the debt assets within our Credit Group are floating rate instruments, which we believe helps mitigate volatility associated with changes in the treasury curve. 

See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Item 1A. herein, for a discussion of the risks to which our businesses are subject.

Consolidation and Deconsolidation of Ares Funds 

Pursuant to GAAP, we consolidate our Consolidated Funds into our financial results as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. These funds represented approximately 4.3% of our AUM as of September 30, 2016, 2.7% of our management fees and 0.0% of our performance fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we consolidated six CLOs and nine private funds, and as of September 30, 2015, we consolidated five CLOs and nine private funds.  

We generally deconsolidate CLOs upon liquidation or dissolution at the end of their finite lives. In contrast, the other funds we advise are deconsolidated when we are no longer deemed to have a controlling interest in the entity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no entities liquidated or dissolved and no non-VIEs experienced a significant change in ownership or control that resulted in deconsolidation during the period. 

The assets and liabilities of our Consolidated Funds are held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of our Consolidated Funds are non recourse to us. Generally, the consolidation of our Consolidated Funds has a significant gross up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no direct net effect on the net income attributable to us. The net economic ownership interests of our Consolidated Funds, to which we have no economic rights, are reflected as non controlling interests in the Consolidated Funds, and prior to December 31, 2015 also as equity appropriated for our Consolidated Funds in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The performance of our Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with, or representative of, the combined performance trends of all of our funds.  

Managing Business Performance 

Non GAAP Financial Measures 

We use the following non-GAAP measures to assess and track our performance: 

Economic Net Income (ENI)     

Fee Related Earnings (FRE)     

Performance Related Earnings (PRE)     

Distributable Earnings (DE)     

The specific components and calculations of these non-GAAP measures are discussed in greater detail in Note 14,  Segment Reporting,  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. These non GAAP financial measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under   Overview of Consolidated Results of Operations , which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure in accordance with GAAP, see   Results of Operations by Segment Reconciliation of Certain Non GAAP Measures to Consolidated GAAP Financial Measures.

Operating Metrics 

We monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry, which are discussed below. 

Assets Under Management 

Assets under management refers to the assets we manage. We view AUM as a metric to measure our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets generally at fair value plus available uncalled capital. For our funds other than CLOs, our AUM equals the sum of the following: 

net asset value ( NAV ) of such funds;     

the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund level including amounts subject to restrictions); and     

uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods).     

NAV refers to the fair value of all the assets of a fund less the fair value of all liabilities of the fund. 

For our funds that are CLOs, our AUM is equal to subordinated notes (equity) plus all drawn and undrawn debt tranches. 

The tables below provide the period to period rollforward of our total AUM by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 

The tables below provide the period to period rollforward of our total AUM by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

Table of Contents  

Please refer to    Results of Operations by Segment  for a more detailed presentation of AUM by segment for each of the periods presented. 

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, our uninvested AUM, which we refer to as dry powder, was $24.5 billion and $21.7 billion, respectively, primarily attributable to our funds in the Credit Group and the Private Equity Group. 

Fee Paying And Fee Earning Assets Under Management 

During the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, we began tracking and presenting FPAUM, which is a different metric from FEAUM. The primary difference is that FPAUM reflects only the AUM that directly pays fees. Except for the Credit Group, FEAUM and FPAUM are generally the same number. Specifically, within U.S. Direct Lending, fee earning AUM includes the AUM of the Senior Secured Loan Program (the  SSLP ), a program co managed by a subsidiary of Ares through which ARCC has co invested with affiliates of General Electric Company ( GE ), and from Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of ARCC and a registered investment adviser, on which we indirectly generate fees, in each case calculated in accordance with the approach described below. In August 2015, GE completed the sale of certain of its assets, excluding its interest in the SSLP, to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( CPPIB ). Prior to closing the sale to CPPIB, GE had announced its intention to provide ARCC and CPPIB the opportunity to work together on the SSLP on a go-forward basis. GE has also stated that if a mutual agreement between ARCC and CPPIB is not reached, it intends to retain its interest in the SSLP and the SSLP would be wound down in an orderly manner. ARCC has been in dialogue with GE and CPPIB to determine if there is an opportunity to work together; however, to date there has been no agreement in respect of the SSLP as a result of these discussions, and there can be no assurance that such discussions will continue or any such agreement will be reached.  

The following components generally comprise our FPAUM (for funds with respect to which we earn management fees directly) and FEAUM (for funds with respect to which we earn management fees both directly and indirectly): 

The amount of limited partner capital commitments for certain closed end funds within the reinvestment period in the Credit Group, funds in the Private Equity Group and certain private funds in the Real Estate Group;      

The amount of limited partner invested capital for the aforementioned closed end funds beyond the reinvestment period as well as the structured assets funds in the Credit Group, certain managed accounts within their reinvestment period, the mezzanine fund in the Credit Group, European commingled funds in the Credit Group and co  invest vehicles in the Real Estate Group;      

The gross amount of aggregate collateral balance, for CLOs, at par, adjusted for defaulted or discounted collateral; and     

The portfolio value, gross asset value or NAV, adjusted in certain instances for cash or certain accrued expenses, for the remaining funds in the Credit Group, ARCC, certain managed accounts in the Credit Group and certain debt funds in the Real Estate Group.

Fund Performance Metrics 

Fund performance information for our investment funds that are considered to be  significant funds  is included throughout this discussion with analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. Our significant funds include those that contributed at least 1% of our total management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or comprised at least 1% of the Company s total FPAUM as of September 30, 2016, and for which we have sole discretion for investment decisions within the fund. In addition to management fees, each of our significant funds may generate incentive fees upon the achievement of performance hurdles. The fund performance information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of our overall performance. An investment in Ares is not an investment in any of our funds. Past performance is not indicative of future results. As with any investment there is always the potential for gains as well as the possibility of losses. There can be no assurance that any of these funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. 

Results of Operations 

Consolidated Results of Operations 

The following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 presented in accordance with GAAP. We consolidate funds where we are deemed to hold a controlling financial interest. The Consolidated Funds are not necessarily the same entities in each year presented due to changes in ownership, changes in limited partners  rights, and the creation and termination

of funds. The consolidation of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds and non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds, among others, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to us for the periods presented.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues 

Management Fees.   Management fees increased by $5.6 million, or 4%, to $163.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and by $7.2 million, or 2%, to $480.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the increases were driven by 12 net new funds and CLOs in the Credit Group and 4 net new funds in the Real Estate Group that began generating management fees subsequent to September 30, 2015, partially offset by one less net new fund in the Private Equity Group. In addition, one time catch-up fees of $1.8

Table of Contents  

million were recognized by one of our Real Estate E.U. equity funds during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Performance Fees.        Performance fees increased by $186.7 million to $164.5 million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to a net fee reversal of $22.2 million for the prior year period and by $177.3 million to $337.7 million for the nine months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   Performance fees from the Private Equity Group, the Credit Group and the Real Estate Group increased by $151.4 million, $35.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $167.9 million, $3.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively, during the nine month period as compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases are primarily due to the appreciation of specific portfolio holdings within certain funds in the Private Equity and Real Estate Groups and to general market appreciation within the Credit Group. 

Administrative and other Fees.        Administrative fees and other income decreased by $0.7 million, or 8%, to $7.4 million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the three months ended   September   30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower property management fees during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. We expect that property management fees will continue to decrease in future periods. 

Administrative fees and other income increased by $1.5 million, or 7%, to $22.8 million for the nine months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended   September   30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in administrative service fees associated with certain funds within the Credit Group related to the growth of the funds   and   the recognition of fees for acting as the agent for certain loans that we have syndicated or fees for syndication. These increases were partially offset by lower property management fees during the nine months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.       

Expenses 

Compensation and Benefits.        Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $7.0 million, or 7%, to $111.9 million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the three months ended   September   30, 2015 and by $29.4 million, or 10%, to $335.2 million for the nine months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended   September   30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to   an increase in incentive-based annual compensation correlated with operating results, and to   salary and benefit expenses attributed to merit-based increases, as well as headcount increases. Additional headcount related to the May 2015 acquisition of First Capital ( FCC ) also contributed to the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Performance Fee Compensation.        Performance fee compensation expenses increased by $143.5 million to $123.2 million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to a reversal of performance fee compensation of $20.3 million for the three months ended   September   30, 2015. Performance fee compensation increased by $141.1 million to $253.7 million for the nine months ended   September   30, 2016  . The changes in performance fee compensation expense directly correlate with changes in our performance fees.  

General, Administrative and Other Expenses.     General, administrative and other expenses decreased by $12.7 million, or 25%, to $38.2 million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the three months ended   September   30, 2015 and by $32.9 million, or 22%, to $116.8 million for the nine months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended   September   30, 2015. The decreases were mostly driven by merger and acquisition related expenses, which decreased $6.2 million and $11.6 million in the three and nine months ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, due to acquisition activity that occurred in 2015. Additionally, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $3.4 million and $16.0 million for the three and nine months ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, primarily due to accelerated amortization of $1.0 million and $7.0 million that was recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, as well as certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2015. Finally, there were decreases of $3.3 million and $3.2 million in professional services expenses for the three and nine month comparative periods, primarily due to costs associated with the initial adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley in our prior year reporting process.  

Expenses of our Consolidated Funds.   Expenses of Consolidated Funds increased by $9.1 million to $10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase   

58 

Table of Contents  

was primarily due to $8.5 million of organizational and offering costs incurred to launch new funds during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Expenses of Consolidated Funds decreased by $4.2 million, or 28%, to $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in professional service expenses in the funds in 2016.  

Other Income (Expense) 

When evaluating the changes in other income (expense), we separately analyze the other income generated by the Company from the investment returns generated by our Consolidated Funds.  

Net Interest and Investment Income (Expense)  .    The Company incurred $3.2 million and $0.8 million less of an expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease was driven by an increase in interest and dividend income and a decrease in interest expense associated with the repayment of notes in connection with terminating a merger agreement in 2015 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other Income (Expense), Net  .    Net other income of the Company increased by $20.3 million to $23.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Net other income (expense) of the Company increased by $34.8 million from an expense of $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to income of $34.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increases were primarily due to the revaluation of our contingent consideration liability related to the Energy Investors Funds ( EIF ) acquisition during the second and third quarter of 2016, resulting in net gains of $17.7 million and $17.6 million for the respective three and nine month periods, due to lower expected commitment period management fee revenue. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $14.7 million of transaction gains from the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies compared to a net transaction loss of $1.8 million in the prior year period.  

Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments  .    Net gain (loss) on investments of the Company increased by $27.0 million from a loss of $7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a gain of $19.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the current nine month period, net gain on investments of the Company increased by $9.3 million to $21.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net gains were primarily due to $12.7 million and $20.8 million, respectively, of net gains on our investments in certain Private Equity Group funds. The net gain on investments in the current three month period also included $6.0 million of net gains on our investments in certain Real Estate Group funds, resulting from appreciation of underlying portfolio companies and assets.  

Net Interest and Investment Income of the Consolidated Funds  .    Net     interest and investment income of the Consolidated Funds increased by $0.3 million to $8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015. The increase in the current year period was driven by the launch of a new CLO in the third quarter of 2016. 

Net     interest and investment income of the Consolidated Funds decreased by $4.2 million, or 14%, to $25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015. The decrease was due mainly to CLOs that did not begin incurring interest expense until after the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, Ares Capital Europe I ( ACE I ) is in the process of liquidating, which further decreased investment income in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by the three month increase in net interest and investment income over the prior year quarter.  

Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments of the Consolidated Funds  .    Net gain (loss) on investments of the Consolidated Funds increased by $62.1 million from a net loss of $38.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a net gain of $23.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was due to increases in the fair value of underlying investments held by certain Private Equity Group funds of $56.7 million and a U.S. direct lending fund of $5.3 million driven by appreciation of certain portfolio holdings.

Net loss on investments of the Consolidated Funds decreased by $34.3 million to $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $40.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in net investment losses was due to increases in the fair value of underlying investments of $46.0 million within certain funds in the Private Equity and Credit Groups, which partially offset other losses on investments. The increases were mostly driven by an increase of the unrealized gains of certain portfolio holdings within Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund Asia, L.P. ( ACOF Asia ) and U.S. direct lending portfolios. These gains were offset by increases in net investment losses from both our European and U.S. CLOs of $8.3 million, primarily resulting from net depreciation of the underlying assets driven by market uncertainties related to Great Britain s exit from the European Union and an interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. 

Income Tax Expense/Benefits.    Not all Company and Consolidated Fund entities are subject to income taxes. As a result, income taxes may not move in tandem with income before taxes. Specifically, the Company s investment income (loss) and generally performance fees are not subject to income tax. 

Income tax expense increased by $2.1 million to $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to additional foreign tax liabilities recognized by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Income tax expense decreased by $7.9 million to $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax benefit resulting from an agreement between Ares Management, L.P. and a subsidiary whereby the subsidiary will remit cash for units awarded under its Equity Incentive Plan, ultimately providing for a difference between taxable income and GAAP income that gives rise to a deferred tax asset. 

Non-Controlling and Redeemable Interest.   Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling and redeemable interests in Ares Operating Group entities represents results attributable to the owners of AOG Units that are not held by Ares Management, L.P. and is allocated based on the weighted average daily ownership of the AOG unitholders. The former owners of Indicus Advisors, LLP ( Indicus ) exercised the put option on their redeemable interest during the third quarter of 2016, at which time the redeemable interest in Ares Operating Group entities ceased to exist. 

Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling and redeemable interests in Ares Operating Group entities increased $83.7 million, from a loss of $17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to income of $66.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Net income attributable to non-controlling and redeemable interests in Ares Operating Group entities increased $72.2 million, from $44.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $116.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The fluctuation of net income attributable to non-controlling and redeemable interests in Ares Operating Group entities is consistent with the change in net income of the Company for those periods. The weighted average daily ownership for non-controlling and redeemable AOG unitholders was 61.83% and 62.02% for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 62.14% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Segment Analysis 

For segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that excludes the results of our Consolidated Funds. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income are typically greater than those presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP because revenues recognized from Consolidated Funds are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, expenses and the effects of other income (expense) are typically lower than related amounts presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP due to the elimination of the results of Consolidated Funds  related expenses upon consolidation. 

Discussed below are our results of operations for each of our three reportable segments. In addition to the three segments, we separately discuss the OMG. This information is used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources.

Credit Group Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Management Fees.    Total management fees increased by $7.4 million, or 7%, to $115.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased by $9.8 million, or 3%, to $332.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in management fees were primarily driven by 4 new CLOs and 16 new funds that began generating fees subsequent to the third quarter of 2015. Compared to the prior periods, the new CLOs and funds generated combined management fees of $7.2 million and $15.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. There was also an increase in ARCC fee-paying assets and loan originations during the period, which generated additional fees of $2.2 million and $3.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in management fees generated by one of our credit funds of $1.4 million and $6.2 million for the three and nine month comparative periods, respectively, due to distributions and changes in market value of the underlying investments in the current year. Also offsetting the increases, fund liquidations that occurred subsequent to September 30, 2015 reduced management fees by $1.4 million and $4.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

The effective management fee rate for our funds in the Credit Group decreased to 1.06% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.14% for the prior year periods. ARCC Part I Fees contributed 0.31% and 0.29% towards the total effective fee rate of the Credit Group for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and contributed 0.33% and 0.32% towards the total effective fee rate of the Credit Group for the respective prior periods.  Several new separately managed accounts and CLOs, which generally have a lower fee rate than other funds in the Credit Group, began generating fees subsequent to September 30, 2015 and contributed to the decline of the effective management fee rate. 

Net Performance Fees.    Net performance fees (expense) include realized and unrealized performance fees, net of realized and unrealized performance fee compensation. The impact of reversals of previously recognized performance fee revenue and the corresponding performance fee compensation expense is reflected in unrealized performance fees and unrealized performance fee compensation.  

Net performance fees increased by $16.2 million, to $14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from a net fee reversal of $1.6 million in the prior year period and increased by $4.4 million, or 23%, to $23.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in net performance fees are primarily due to increases in the valuations of certain portfolio holdings when compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Compensation and Benefits.   Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $3.2 million, or 8%, to $43.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and by $7.1 million, or 6%, to $130.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases for both periods are primarily due to increases in incentive based compensation. In addition, salary and benefits expenses increased in the current year periods due to merit-based increases and an increase in employee headcount. Compensation and benefits represented 37.7% and 39.3% of management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 37.3% and 38.3% of management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

General, Administrative and Other Expenses.    General, administrative and other expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 8%, to $7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and by $2.9 million, or 14%, to $18.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cost-containment initiatives during the 2016 periods led to decreases in the use of professional service providers, driving expenses lower compared to prior year periods.  

Net Investment Income (Loss).    Net investment income (loss) increased by $13.7 million from a net loss of $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to net investment income of $10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by continued overall improvements in the credit markets

that resulted in unrealized market appreciation of $5.6 million for the syndicated loan, credit opportunities and structured credit funds during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to unrealized losses of $5.7 million for the same funds during the three month period in 2015. Additionally, interest expense decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to a decrease in interest expense associated with the repayment of notes in connection with terminating a merger agreement in 2015.  

Net investment income increased by $20.6 million to $24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by transaction gains from the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which were $14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and are included in interest and other investment income. The increase was also driven by market appreciation in the syndicated loan, credit opportunities and structured credit funds that had net investment gains of $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the overall improvement in the credit markets compared to $3.2 million net investment losses on the same funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Non-GAAP Performance Measures.   The increases of $16.2 million and $13.7 million in net performance fees and net investment income, respectively, increased our PRE and ENI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Included in net performance fees was an increase of $10.9 million in net realized performance fees, which contributed to the increase of DE. Increases in management fees of $7.4 million, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits expenses of $3.2 million, resulted in an overall increase to FRE, which also positively impacted ENI and DE. 

The increases of $4.4 million and $20.6 million in net performance fees and net investment income, respectively, increased our PRE and ENI for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Included in net performance fees and net investment income were decreases of $0.4 million in net realized performance fees and $1.9 million in net realized investment and other income, which contributed to the decrease of DE. The period over period increase in management fees of $9.8 million and decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $2.9 million were partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses, resulting in an overall increase to FRE and positively impacting ENI and DE.

Credit Group Fund Performance Metrics as of September 30, 2016 

The Credit Group managed 135 funds as of September 30, 2016 across the liquid and illiquid credit strategies. ARCC contributed approximately 58% of the Credit Group s total management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition to ARCC, we have six significant funds which contributed approximately 8% of the Credit Group s management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our significant funds include Ares Credit Strategies Fund I ( CSF ), a managed account with a flexible and opportunistic mandate to invest in corporate credit funds; ARCC, a publicly-traded business development company that principally originates and invests in first lien senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and mezzanine debt in the United States; Ares Capital Europe II, L.P. ( ACE II ), a 2013 vintage commingled fund focused on direct lending to European middle market companies; Ares Capital Europe III, L.P. ( ACE III ), a 2015 vintage commingled fund focused on direct lending to European middle market companies; and three separately managed accounts over which we exercise sole investment discretion. We do not show fund performance metrics for significant funds with less than two years of historical information.  

The following table presents the performance data for our significant funds in the Credit Group that are not drawdown funds: 

(1) 

AUM equals the sum of the NAV for such fund, the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund-level including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital.

Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses.     

(3) 

Since inception returns are annualized.     

(4) 

Net returns are calculated using the fund's NAV and assume dividends are reinvested at the closest quarter-end NAV to the relevant quarterly ex-dividend dates. Additional information related to ARCC can be found in its financial statements filed with the SEC, which are not part of this quarterly report.     

(5) 

Gross returns do not reflect the deduction of management fees or any other expenses. Net returns are calculated by subtracting the applicable management fee from the gross returns on a monthly basis.     

The following table presents the performance data of our significant drawdown funds: 

(1) 

AUM equals the sum of the NAV for such fund, the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund-level including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital. The AUM for CSF, a fund of funds, includes AUM that has been committed to other Ares funds.     

(2) 

Realized proceeds represent the sum of all cash distributions to all partners.     

(3) 

Unrealized value represents the fund's NAV. There can be no assurance that unrealized values will be realized at the valuations shown.     

(4) 

The gross multiple of invested capital ( MoIC ) is calculated at the fund-level. For CSF, the gross MoIC is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partner. For ACE II and ACE III, the gross MoIC is based on the interests of all partners. For all funds, the gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, performance fees as applicable and other expenses.     

(5) 

The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes those interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner who does not pay management fees or performance fees. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees, performance fees as applicable and other expenses.     

(6) 

The gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. For CSF, the gross IRR reflects returns to the fee-paying limited partner. For ACE II, the gross IRR reflects returns to all partners. For all funds, the cash flow dates used in the gross IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, performance fees as applicable, and other expenses.     

(7) 

The net IRR is an annualized since inception net internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Net IRRs reflect returns to the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner who does not pay management fees or performance fees. The cash flow dates used in the net IRR calculations are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to management fees, performance fees as applicable, and other expenses.     

(8) 

ACE II is made up of two feeder funds, one denominated in U.S. dollars and one denominated in Euros. The gross and net IRR and gross and net MoIC presented in the chart are for the U.S. dollar denominated feeder fund as that is the larger of the two feeders. The gross and net IRR for the Euro denominated feeder fund are 13.4% and 10.1%, respectively. The gross and net MoIC for the Euro denominated feeder fund are 1.3x and 1.2x, respectively. Original capital commitments are converted to U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the fund's closing. All other values for ACE II are for the combined fund and are converted to U.S. dollars at the prevailing quarter-end exchange rate. The variance between the gross and net MoICs and the net IRRs for the U.S. dollar denominated and Euro denominated feeder funds is driven by the U.S. GAAP mark-to-market reporting of the foreign currency hedging program in the U.S. dollar denominated feeder fund. The feeder fund will be holding the foreign currency hedges until maturity, and therefore is expected to ultimately recognize a gain while mitigating the currency risk associated with the initial principle investments.     

(9) 

ACE III is made up of two feeder funds, one denominated in U.S. dollars and one denominated in Euros. The gross and net MoIC presented in the chart are for the Euro denominated feeder fund as that is the larger of the two feeders. The gross and net MoIC for the U.S. dollar denominated feeder fund are 1.1x and 1.1x, respectively. Original capital commitments are converted to U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the fund's closing. All other values for ACE III are for the combined fund and are converted to U.S. dollars at the prevailing quarter-end exchange rate.

Private Equity Group Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Management Fees.    Total management fees decreased by $2.9 million, or 8%, to $35.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and decreased by $2.5 million, or 2%, to $111.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, several special situations and power and energy infrastructure funds beyond their reinvestment period made distributions that led to a reduction of management fees by $2.8 million and $4.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Also contributing to the decrease in the current year periods was the absence of management fees from Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund II, L.P. ( ACOF II ), from which we generated $0.7 million and $3.0 million of fees in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. In connection with an extension of ACOF II s term for one year, we agreed to waive management fees starting in the first quarter of 2016. The decreases were partially offset by $1.4 million and $4.0 million of fees generated in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from two power and energy infrastructure mandates that began paying management fees in the fourth quarter of 2015. Also offsetting the decrease in the nine month period, was a $1.7 million increase in management fees from a special situations fund due to increased capital deployment in the current year period. 

The effective management fee rate decreased from 1.28% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 1.23% and 1.25% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective rates is primarily a result of several funds reaching the end of their investment periods subsequent to September 30, 2015, which caused a reduction in the fee rates. 

Net Performance Fees.   Net performance fees (expense) include realized and unrealized performance fees, net of realized and unrealized performance fee compensation. The impact of reversals of previously recognized performance fee   

71 

Table of Contents  

revenue and the corresponding performance fee compensation expense is reflected in unrealized performance fees and unrealized performance fee compensation.  

Net performance fees increased by $33.4 million to $24.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from a net fee reversal of $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased by $38.1 million to $55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases for both periods were primarily driven by the appreciation in fair value of certain portfolio assets within our corporate private equity strategy when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Compensation and Benefits.   Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $1.6 million, or 11%, to $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased by $3.4 million, or 8%, to $43.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases are primarily due to increases in incentive based compensation.  Additionally, salary and benefits expenses also increased in the current year period due to merit based increases and an increase in headcount in anticipation of Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund V, L.P. ( ACOF V ) capital deployment. Compensation and benefits represented 43.9% and 39.0% of management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 36.4% and 35.2% for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. We expect the increase in compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of management fees to be temporary and to trend lower upon deployment of capital in ACOF V. 

General, Administrative and Other Expenses.   General, administrative and other expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 25%, to $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and by $0.2 million, or 2%, to $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases are primarily due to increases in travel related and professional services expenses. 

Net Investment Income (Loss).   Net investment income was $17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of appreciation on our investment in ACOF Asia of $5.6 million, net gains on our investment in Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund III, L.P. ( ACOF III ) of $3.9 million primarily due to proceeds from a sale of an underlying portfolio company, and net gains on our investments in the special situations funds of $4.0 million due to appreciation on underlying investments. In comparison, there was a net investment loss of $28.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of unrealized losses on our investments in ACOF Asia of $16.3 million, in ACOF III of $1.4 million, and in special situations funds of $7.9 million. 

Net investment income was $17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of net gains on our investments in ACOF III of $15.1 million resulting from dividends of $8.3 million and net unrealized and realized gains of $6.8 million. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also included $6.6 million and $3.7 million in net gains from our investments in Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund IV, L.P. ( ACOF IV ) and certain special situations funds, respectively, primarily from market appreciation on the underlying investments. These gains were offset by $7.8 million in unrealized losses on our investments in ACOF Asia. In comparison, there was a $21.8 million net investment loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of net losses of $19.0 million and $11.8 million on our investments in ACOF Asia and certain special situations funds, respectively. These net losses were partially offset by net gains of $15.1 million on our investments in the North American and European based funds within our corporate private equity strategy driven by unrealized fair value changes on the underlying investments. 

Non-GAAP Performance Measures.   The increases of $33.4 million and $45.6 million in net performance fees and net investment income, respectively, increased our PRE and ENI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Included in net performance fees and net investment income were increases of $21.7 million and $15.4 million in net realized performance fees and net realized investment and other income, respectively, which increased DE. The decrease in FRE, impacted mostly by a decrease in management fees of $2.9 million, partially offset the increases of DE and ENI. 

The increases of $38.1 million and $39.7 million in net performance fees and net investment income, respectively, increased our PRE and ENI for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Included in net performance fees and net investment income were increases of $29.5 million and $13.5 million in net realized performance fees and net realized investment and other income, respectively, which increased DE. The decrease

Private Equity Group Fund Performance Metrics as of September 30, 2016 

The Private Equity Group managed 22 commingled funds and related co-investment vehicles as of September 30, 2016. ACOF III, ACOF IV,   U.S. Power Fund III ( USPF III )   and   U.S. Power Fund IV ( USPF IV )  , each considered a significant fund, combined for approximately 86% of the Private Equity Group s management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our Corporate Private Equity funds focus on majority or shared control investments, principally in under capitalized companies in North America, Europe and Asia. ACOF III is in harvest mode, meaning it is generally not seeking to deploy capital into new investment opportunities, while ACOF IV is in deployment mode. Each of our U.S. power and energy infrastructure funds focuses on generating long term, stable cash flowing investments in the power generation, transmission and midstream energy sector. USPF III and USPF IV, acquired in connection with the acquisition of EIF in January 2015, are in harvest mode and deployment mode, respectively.  

The following table presents the performance data for our significant funds in the Private Equity Group, all of which are drawdown funds:

Management Fees.    Total management fees increased by $2.1 million, or 14%, to $17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and by $1.8 million, or 4%, to $50.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. One of the E.U. equity funds launched in the middle of the third quarter of 2015 and has continued to raise capital after its launch date, generating additional management fees of $2.8 million and $4.9 million, of which $1.8 million represented one time catch-up fees, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. In addition, new funds launched subsequent to September 30, 2015 also contributed to the increases in management fees, generating $0.6 million and $1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These increases were partially offset by funds that ended their investment period subsequent to September 30, 2015, including Ares European Real Estate Fund III ( EU III ), which generated $0.5 million and $2.8 million less in management fees during the three and nine month current year periods, respectively. Finally, a U.S. real estate equity fund nearing the end of its investment period made distributions that resulted in reduced management fees of $0.6 million and $1.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the respective prior year periods. 

The effective management fee rate remained consistent at 1.03% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Catch-up fees recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 contributed 0.03% to the current quarter s effective management fee rate. The effective management fee rate decreased to 0.99% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.09% for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective management fee rate for the Real Estate Group is the result of certain new funds with lower fee rates than historical average rates.   

Net Performance Fees.    Net performance fees include realized and unrealized performance fees, net of realized and unrealized performance fee compensation. The impact of reversals of previously recognized performance fee revenue and the corresponding performance fee compensation expense is reflected in unrealized performance fees and performance fee compensation.  

Net performance fees decreased by $1.7 million to $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and by 0.9 million to $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. While our Real Estate Group funds continued to generate performance fees overall, a decrease in the performance fees associated with AREA Sponsor Holdings LLC resulted in the recognition of less performance fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Compensation and Benefits.    Compensation and benefits expenses decreased by $1.3 million, or 12%, to $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and by $0.5 million, or 2%, to $29.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases are primarily attributed to a decrease in employee salary expense due to a reduction in headcount, including a reorganization of the group s management team, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year was partially offset by an increase in incentive based compensation. Compensation and benefits represented 50.5% of management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 65.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and represented 58.8% of management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 62.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

General, Administrative and Other Expenses.    General, administrative and other expenses decreased by $2.7 million, or 55%, to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period and by $3.2 million, or 29%, to $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Lower travel related expenses, professional services expenses and occupancy in connection with cost-containment initiatives reduced general, administrative and other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods.  

Net Investment Income.    Net investment income increased by $5.9 million to $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net investment income is primarily attributable to increases in valuations in a domestic emerging markets fund held in AREA Sponsor Holdings LLC. AREA Sponsor Holdings LLC had increased net investment income of $4.8 million during the   

78 

Table of Contents  

current year period compared to the prior year.  

Net investment income increased by $7.5 million to $9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net investment income was primarily due to an increase in valuations of underlying assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our investments in certain U.S. and E.U. equity funds generated net investment income of $8.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of which $5.2 million related to AREA Sponsor Holdings LLC. In comparison, our investments in certain U.S. and E.U. equity funds generated $2.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in net investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Non-GAAP Performance Measures.   The $5.9 million increase in net investment income was the primary driver of the increase in PRE and ENI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in PRE and ENI were partially offset by the decrease of $1.7 million in net performance fees.  Included in net performance fees was a $1.0 million increase in net realized performance fees, which contributed to the increase of DE. Increases in management fees of $2.1 million and decreases in general, administrative and other expenses and compensation and benefits expenses of $2.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, resulted in an overall increase to FRE, positively impacting ENI and DE when comparing the three month periods. 

The $7.5 million increase in net investment income was the primary driver of the increases in PRE and ENI for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increases in PRE and ENI were partially offset by the decrease of $0.9 million in net performance fees. Included in net performance fees was an increase of $3.8 million in net realized performance fees, which increased DE. The period over period increase in management fees of $1.8 million and decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $3.2 million were the primary drivers to the overall increase to FRE, positively impacting ENI and DE.

Operations Management Group Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Compensation and Benefits.    Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $3.0 million, or 11%, to $29.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased by $14.7 million, or 21%, to $86.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Salary and benefits expenses increased in the current year period due to additional headcount, which for the nine month period was primarily related to the FCC acquisition which closed in the second quarter of 2015. In addition, incentive-based compensation also increased in the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Administrative fees, which are presented as a reduction to compensation and benefits expense, increased by $0.5 million and $1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, partially offsetting the other increases in compensation and benefits expenses in the current year periods. 

General, Administrative and Other Expenses.    General, administrative and other expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 2%, to $13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributed to cost containment measures that led to lower professional services expenses incurred in the current year quarter.  

General, administrative and other expenses increased by $3.1 million, or 7%, to $46.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016 we realigned certain general, administrative and other expenses with our operating activities, which resulted in an increase in occupancy expenses recognized within OMG. Administration fees, which are presented as a reduction to     general, administrative and other expenses, decreased by $1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, also increasing general, administrative and other expenses period over period. Conversely, professional services expenses decreased due to cost containment initiatives during the current year period. 

Net Investment Loss.    Net investment losses were $4.7 million and $17.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, there was no investment activity within OMG. In the third quarter of 2016, we realized a $20.0 million loss on our minority interest equity method investment in   Deimos Management Holdings LLC   due to the winding down of its operations. Of the $20.0 million realized loss, $14.1 million was recognized as an unrealized loss in the second quarter of 2016. Net investment loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was positively impacted by net unrealized gains of $1.9 million from other fund investments.

Table of Contents  

Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 interest expense of $0.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, was allocated to OMG contributing to the net investment loss. 

Non-GAAP Performance Measures.   For the three months ending September 30, 2016, FRE decreased by $2.7 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $3.0 million, which also negatively impacted OMG s DE and ENI period over period. PRE was negative $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, attributable to realized losses on certain investments not directly aligned with one of our three operating segments and negatively impacted the change in ENI and DE for the comparable periods. 

For the nine months ending September 30, 2016, FRE decreased by $17.9 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and general, administrative and other expenses of $14.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively. These changes also drove the decrease in OMG s DE and ENI period over period. PRE was negative $17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, attributable to realized losses on certain investments not directly aligned with one of our three operating segments and also drove the year over year decreases in ENI and DE. 

Reconciliation of Certain Non GAAP Measures to Consolidated GAAP Financial Measures 

Income before provision for income taxes is the GAAP financial measure most comparable to ENI, FRE, PRE and DE. For a detailed reconciliation of certain non GAAP measures to our most comparable Consolidated GAAP financial measure, see Note 14,  Segment Reporting,  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources and Uses of Liquidity 

Our sources of liquidity are (1) cash on hand, (2) net working capital, (3) cash from operations, including management fees, which are collected monthly, quarterly or semi annually, net realized performance fees, which are unpredictable as to amount and timing and fund distributions related to our investments in products that we manage, which are also unpredictable as to amount and timing, and (4)  net borrowing provided by the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $336.8 million, including investments in money market funds, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the $1.03 billion Credit Facility. The ability to make drawings under the Credit Facility is subject to a leverage covenant. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future. 

We expect that our primary liquidity needs will continue to be to (1) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing investment management businesses, (2) fund a portion of our investment commitments for funds that we advise and other investment commitments, (3) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into businesses that are complementary to our existing investment management businesses, (4) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees and payments under the tax receivable agreement ( TRA ), (5) fund capital expenditures, (6) repay borrowings under the Credit Facility, Senior Notes, Term Loan and related interest costs, (7) pay income taxes and (8) make distributions to our common and preferred unitholders in accordance with our distribution policy.  

In the normal course of business, we have made distributions to our existing owners, including distributions sourced from investment income and performance fees. If cash flow from operations were insufficient to fund distributions over a sustained period of time, we expect that we would suspend paying such distributions. Unless quarterly distributions have been declared and paid (or declared and set apart for payment) on the preferred units, we may not declare or pay or set apart payment for distributions on any common units during the period.   The preferred units are not convertible into common units or any other security. 

Net realized performance fees also provide a source of liquidity. Performance fees are realized when a  portfolio investment is profitably disposed of and the fund s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return or hurdle rate. Performance fees are typically realized at the end of each fund s measurement period when investment performance exceeds a stated benchmark or hurdle rate. 

Our accrued performance fees by segment as of September 30, 2016, gross and net of accrued contingent repayment obligations, are set forth below (in thousands): 

(1) 

Amounts represent accrued performance fees earned from Consolidated Funds that are eliminated in consolidation.     

Our condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the cash flows of our operating businesses as well as the results of our Consolidated Funds. The assets of our Consolidated Funds, on a gross basis, are significantly larger than the assets of our operating businesses and therefore have a substantial effect on our reported cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our Consolidated Funds include: (1) raising capital from third party investors, which is reflected as non controlling interests of our Consolidated Funds when required to be consolidated into our condensed consolidated financial statements, (2) financing certain investments by issuing debt, (3) purchasing and selling investment securities, (4) generating cash through the realization of certain investments, (5) collecting interest and dividend income and (6) distributing cash to investors. Our Consolidated Funds are treated as investment companies for financial accounting purposes under GAAP; therefore, the character and classification of all Consolidated Fund transactions are presented as cash flows from operations.

Cash Flows 

The significant captions and amounts from our condensed consolidated financial statements, which include the effects of our Consolidated Funds and CLOs, in accordance with GAAP, are summarized below. Negative amounts represent a net outflow, or use of cash. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is primarily driven by our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for non cash compensation and performance fees. Cash used to purchase investments, as well as the proceeds from the sale of such investments, is also reflected in the operating activities of the Company and our Consolidated Funds. 

Our net cash flows used in operating activities were $259.4 million and $521.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change was primarily due to proceeds from the sale or pay down of investments by our Consolidated Funds which increased from $853.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our increasing working capital needs reflect the growth of our business, while the capital requirements needed to support fund-related activities vary based upon the specific investment activities being conducted during such period. The movements within our Consolidated Funds do not adversely impact our liquidity or earnings trends. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations, as well as the capacity under the Credit Facility, provides us with the necessary liquidity to manage short-term fluctuations in working capital and to meet our short-term commitments. 

Investing Activities 

Our investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions and the purchase of fixed assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $8.2 million and $73.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in investing activities was due to $64.4 million of cash used to complete acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $489.7 million and $836.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of our June 2016 preferred equity offering, net of issuance costs, resulted in net cash inflows of $298.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The prior year nine month period included proceeds of $316.5 million from the issuance of the 2015 Senior Notes (the  AFC II Notes ). The proceeds from the preferred equity offering were used to temporarily repay the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility of the Company, pending consummation of the   ARCC and   American Capital, Ltd. Merger Agreement ( ARCC-ACAS Transaction ), resulting in net repayments on debt obligations of the Company of $110.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net borrowings of $35.3 million for the same period in 2015. Distributions to our senior professionals, common unitholders and other owners of Ares Operating Group decreased by $33.0 million to $150.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to lower fee related earning and realized performance related earnings.  

Our Consolidated Funds borrowed $427.1 million and $662.7 million, net of repayments, under their loan obligations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net borrowings was   

86 

Table of Contents  

primarily due to the relative sizes of the CLOs launched in each period. Distributions from non controlling interests in our Consolidated Funds decreased $21.9 million to $61.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the liquidation of certain investments held by funds in our Private Equity and Credit Group portfolios during the prior year period. 

Capital Resources 

The following table summarizes the Company s debt obligations (in thousands): 

(1) 

The Ares Operating Group entities are borrowers under the Credit Facility, which provides a $1.03 billion revolving line of credit with the ability to upsize to $1.28 billion (subject to obtaining commitments for any such additional borrowing capacity). It has a variable interest rate based on either LIBOR or a base rate plus an applicable margin with an unused commitment fee paid quarterly, which is subject to change with our underlying credit agency rating.  Currently, base rate loans bear interest calculated based on a base rate plus 0.75% and LIBOR rate loans bear interest calculated based on LIBOR plus 1.75%. The unused commitment fee is 0.25% per annum. There is a base rate floor and LIBOR floor of zero.

The Senior Notes were issued in October 2014 by Ares Finance Co. LLC ( AFC ), a subsidiary of Ares Holdings, at 98.268% of the face amount with interest paid semi-annually. AFC may redeem the Senior Notes prior to maturity, subject to the terms of the indenture.     

(3) 

A subsidiary of the Company is the borrower. The Term Loan is backed by collateral in the form of CLO senior tranches owned by the Company. To the extent the assets are not sufficient to cover the Term Loan, there is no further recourse to the Company to fund or repay the remaining balance. Interest is paid quarterly, and the Company also pays a fee of 0.025% of a maximum investment amount.     

As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility, Senior Notes and Term Loan obligations.    

We intend to use a portion of our available liquidity to make cash distributions to our preferred and common unitholders on a quarterly basis in accordance with the terms of our distribution policies. Our ability to make cash distributions to our preferred and common unitholders is dependent on a myriad of factors, including among others: general economic and business conditions; our strategic plans and prospects; our business and investment opportunities; timing of capital calls by our funds in support of our commitments; our financial condition and operating results; working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs; contractual restrictions and obligations; legal, tax and regulatory restrictions; restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us and other relevant factors.  

We are required to maintain minimum net capital balances for regulatory purposes for our United Kingdom subsidiaries and for our subsidiary that operates as a broker dealer. These net capital requirements are met in part by retaining cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. As a result, we may be restricted in our ability to transfer cash between different operating entities and jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2016, we were required to maintain approximately   $19.9   million in liquid net assets within these subsidiaries to meet regulatory net capital and capital adequacy requirements. We remain in compliance with all regulatory requirements. 

Holders of AOG Units, subject to the terms of the exchange agreement, may exchange their AOG Units for Ares Management, L.P. common units on a one for one basis. Subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Ares Management, L.P. that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Ares Management, L.P. s wholly owned subsidiaries that are taxable as corporations for U.S. federal income purposes, which we refer to as the  corporate taxpayers,  would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The corporate taxpayers entered into the TRA with the TRA recipients that will provide for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to

the TRA recipients of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA and interest accrued thereon. This payment obligation is an obligation of the corporate taxpayers and not of Ares Management, L.P. Future payments under the TRA in respect of subsequent exchanges are expected to be substantial. As of September 30, 2016, there have been a limited number of exchanges of AOG Units for Ares Management, L.P. common units.  

Preferred Equity  

In June 2016, we issued preferred equity consisting of 12,400,000 units designated as Series A Preferred Equity (the  Preferred Equity ), for a total offering price of $310.0 million. When, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors, distributions on the Preferred Equity are paid quarterly at a rate per annum equal to 7.00%. The first dividend of $0.544444 per unit of approximately $6.8 million, was declared and paid on September 30, 2016. The Preferred Equity may be redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 30, 2021, at a price of $25.00 per unit. The proceeds, net of expenses, totaling $298.6 million were temporarily used to repay the outstanding balance on our Credit Facility pending consummation of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction. If the ARCC-ACAS Transaction is not consummated, we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including for acquisitions and investments and for repayments of borrowings under the Credit Facility.  

Additionally, cash distributions to our common unitholders may be impacted by any corporate tax liability owed by Ares Holdings, Inc. ( AHI ), the wholly owned U.S. corporate subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Preferred Equity issuance, the Ares Operating Group issued mirror preferred units ( GP Mirror Units ) paying the same 7.00% rate per annum to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company including AHI. Although income allocated in respect of distributions on the GP Mirror Units made to AHI is subject to tax, cash distributions to our preferred unitholders will not be reduced on account of any income taxes owed by AHI. As a result, the amounts ultimately distributed by us to our common unitholders may be reduced by any corporate taxes imposed on AHI. 

Exercise of Indicus Fixed Put Option 

Upon acquisition of Indicus in November 2011, certain former owners of Indicus ( Former Owners ) were provided a put option on their equity interest at a strike price of $40 million to be exercised during 2016 ( Fixed Price Put Option ), among other consideration. In August 2016, the Former Owners  exercised their Fixed Price Put Option. We expect to make a payment of $40 million to settle this option in November 2016.   

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting estimates could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. For a summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a summary of our critical accounting estimates, please see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Critical Accounting Estimates  in our Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Company can be found in Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  in the  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10 K.    

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, we engage in off balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in derivatives, guarantees, commitments, indemnifications and potential contingent repayment obligations.     See Note 9,  Commitments and Contingencies,  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 

Commitments and Contingencies 

Capital Commitments  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had aggregate unfunded commitments of $598.4 million and $436.4 million, respectively, including commitments to both non-consolidated funds and Consolidated Funds.  

As of September 30, 2016, we had $33.3 million in unfunded commitments to invest in certain funds managed by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, L.P.  

ARCC and   American Capital, Ltd. Merger Agreement 

To support the ARCC-ACAS Transaction, the Company, through its subsidiary Ares Capital Management LLC, which serves as the investment adviser to ARCC, will provide approximately $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of ACAS common stock, payable to ACAS shareholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement at the closing of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction. The Transaction Support is conditioned upon completion of the ARCC-ACAS Transaction. 

Guarantees 

On July 30, 2014, AM LLC agreed to provide credit support to a $75.0 million credit facility (the  Guaranteed Facility ), entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation ( ACRE ) with a national banking association. The Guaranteed Facility was extended through September 30, 2016, at which time the credit   

89 

Table of Contents  

facility was repaid and the Guaranteed Facility expired. 

Indemnifications 

Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain indemnities for our affiliates, persons acting on our behalf or such affiliates and third parties. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the maximum exposure under these arrangements, if any, cannot be determined and has not been recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2016, we have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote. 

Contingent Obligations 

The partnership documents governing our funds generally include a provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to investors. Therefore, performance fees, generally, are subject to reversal in the event that the funds incur future losses. These losses are limited to the extent of the cumulative performance fees recognized in income to date. Based primarily on our investment performance and the fact that our performance fees are generally determined on a liquidation basis, if the funds were liquidated at their then current fair values as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, there would be no contingent obligation. Accordingly, the Company did not record a contingent liability as of either date.   There can be no assurance that we will not incur further contingent   obligations in the future. If all of the existing investments were deemed worthless, the amount of cumulative revenues that has been recognized would be reversed. We believe that the possibility of all of the existing investments becoming worthless is remote. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, had we assumed all existing investments were worthless, the amount of performance fees, net of tax, subject to potential repayment, would have been approximately $366.1 million and $322.2 million, respectively, of which approximately $283.0 million and $247.9 million, respectively, is reimbursable to the Company by certain professionals. 

Performance fees are also affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that we advise. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, bond yields and industry trading multiples. 

Our senior professionals and other professionals who have received performance fees distributions are responsible for funding their proportionate share of any contingent obligations. However, the governing agreements of certain of our funds provide that if a current or former professional from such funds does not fund his or her respective share, then we may have to fund additional amounts beyond what we received in performance fees, although we will generally retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those performance fees recipients who fail to fund their obligations. 

Additionally, at the end of the life of the funds there could be a payment due to a fund by us if we have recognized more performance fees than was ultimately earned. The general partner obligation amount, if any, will depend on final realized values of investments at the end of the life of the fund. There was no obligation of the general partner at September 30, 2016.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Ris  k 

Our primary exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment adviser to our investment funds and the sensitivity to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect on management fees, performance fees and investment income. 

The market price of investments may significantly fluctuate during the period of investment. Investments may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries represented in the securities markets. The value of an investment may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to such investment, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally. They may also decline due to factors that affect a particular industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry. 

Our credit orientation has been a central tenet of our business across our debt and equity investment strategies. Our investment professionals benefit from our independent research and relationship networks in over 50 industries, and insights from our portfolio of active investments. We believe the combination of high quality proprietary information flow and a consistent, rigorous approach to managing investments across our strategies has been, and we believe will continue to be, a major driver of our strong risk adjusted returns and the stability and predictability of our income. 

There have been no material changes in our market risks for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For additional information on our market risks, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is accessible on the SEC s website at sec.gov. 

Item 4.  Controls And Procedure  s 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co principal executive officers and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATIO  N 

Item 1.  Legal Proceeding  s 

From time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business, some of which may be material. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were not subject to any material pending legal proceedings. Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factor  s 

The recent vote in the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business and our operations. 

The recent vote by the electorate in a referendum in the United Kingdom (U.K.) to exit from the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as  Brexit ) could disrupt our business and operations, including the liquidity and value of our investments. Since its announcement, Brexit has caused significant geo-political uncertainty and market volatility in the U.K. and elsewhere.  Although the referendum is non-binding, the U.K. s leadership has indicated that it expects Brexit to be passed into law and to commence negotiations with the E.U. to determine the future terms, including with respect to trade, of the U.K. s ongoing relationship with the E.U.  These negotiations are expected to take a number of years, which could prolong the related uncertainty and volatility, which among other things, could affect the pace of capital deployment and investment realizations.   

Depending on the outcome of these negotiations, the U.K. could lose access to the single E.U. market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the E.U. on behalf of its members, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our portfolio companies. For example, a decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global investment center and, as a result, could make doing business in Europe more difficult. In addition, our current and prospective funds could lose their Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive marketing passport, which provides them the license to market funds across borders within the single E.U. market without obtaining local regulatory approval.  The movement of capital and the mobility of personnel may also be restricted. These and other by-products of Brexit, such as the tightening of credit in the U.K. commercial real estate market, may also increase the costs of having operations, conducting business and making investments in the U.K. and Europe.   As a result, the performance of our funds which are focused on investing in the U.K. and to a lesser extent across Europe, such as certain funds in our Credit and Real Estate Groups may be disproportionately affected compared to those funds that invest more broadly across global geographies or are focused on different regions.  

The Brexit vote has also caused exchange rate fluctuations that have resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business, including the British pound and the Euro.  Where un-hedged, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may, among other things, adversely affect the results of operations of our funds and investments that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies and also adversely affect businesses that rely on the strength of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, and thereby have a negative impact on our investments in those businesses.  Movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and non U.S. dollar currencies affect the management fees earned by funds with fee earning AUM denominated in non U.S. dollar currencies as well as by funds with fee earning AUM denominated in U.S. dollars that hold investments denominated in non U.S. dollar currencies.  Additionally, movements in exchange rates affect operating expenses for our foreign offices that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies, cash balances we hold in non-U.S. currencies and investments we hold in non-U.S. currencies. 

Further, the U.K. s determination as to which, if any, E.U. laws to repeal, retain, replace or replicate upon its exit from the E.U. could exacerbate the uncertainty and result in divergent national laws and regulations.  Changes to the regulatory regimes in the U.K. or the E.U. and its member states could materially affect our business prospects and opportunities and increase our costs.  In addition, Brexit could potentially disrupt the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and affect the tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions in a manner that is adverse to us and/or our funds.  Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
