CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Columbia Property Trust, Inc. ("Columbia Property Trust," "the Company," "we," "our," or "us") other than historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in those acts. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, and prospects and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "continue," or other similar words. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date this report is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). We make no representations or warranties (express or implied) about the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
  Any such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors and are based on a number of assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, and market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual conditions, our ability to accurately anticipate results expressed in such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, make distributions to stockholders, and maintain the value of our real estate properties, may be significantly hindered. See Item 1A in Columbia Property Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risk factors described in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face, but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.

           1. 
    Organization 
     Columbia Property Trust, Inc. ("Columbia Property Trust") (NYSE: CXP) is a Maryland corporation that operates as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes and owns and operates commercial real estate properties. Columbia Property Trust was incorporated in 2003, commenced operations in 2004, and conducts business primarily through Columbia Property Trust Operating Partnership, L.P. ("Columbia Property Trust OP"), a Delaware limited partnership. Columbia Property Trust is the general partner and sole owner of Columbia Property Trust OP and possesses full legal control and authority over its operations. Columbia Property Trust OP acquires, develops, owns, leases, and operates real properties directly, through wholly owned subsidiaries, or through joint ventures. References to Columbia Property Trust, "we," "us," or "our" herein shall include Columbia Property Trust and all subsidiaries of Columbia Property Trust, direct and indirect, and any unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  Columbia Property Trust typically invests in high-quality, income-generating office properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , Columbia Property Trust owned   24   office properties and   one   hotel, containing approximately   11.6 million   square feet of commercial space, located in   11   states and the District of Columbia. All of the properties are wholly owned, except for one property, which is owned through an unconsolidated joint venture, as described in Note 4,   Unconsolidated Joint Venture  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the office properties, including   51%   of the Market Square Joint Venture, in which Columbia Property Trust owns a   51%   interest, were approximately   90.7%   leased, excluding the 9127 South Jamaica Street building, which was subsequently sold on October  12, 2016 (see Note 3, Real Estate Transactions). 
   
           2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements of Columbia Property Trust have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements for these unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results for such periods. Results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of a full year's results. Columbia Property Trust's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Columbia Property Trust, Columbia Property Trust OP, and any variable interest entity in which Columbia Property Trust or Columbia Property Trust OP was deemed the primary beneficiary. With respect to entities that are not variable interest entities, Columbia Property Trust's consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of any entity in which Columbia Property Trust, Columbia Property Trust OP, or their subsidiaries own a controlling financial interest and any limited partnership in which Columbia Property Trust, Columbia Property Trust OP, or their subsidiaries own a controlling general partnership interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in Columbia Property Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the "  2015   Form 10-K"). 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Columbia Property Trust estimates the fair value of its assets and liabilities (where currently required under GAAP) consistent with the provisions of Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") 820,   Fair Value Measurements   ("ASC 820"). Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. While various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the accounting standard for fair value measurements and disclosures provides the following fair value technique parameters and hierarchy, depending upon availability: 
  Level 1   Assets or liabilities for which the identical term is traded on an active exchange, such as publicly traded instruments or futures contracts. 
  Level 2   Assets or liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments. 
  Level 3   Assets or liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market. Such assets or liabilities are valued based on the best available data, some of which may be internally developed. Significant assumptions may include risk premiums that a market participant would consider. 
  
   Page 10 

Real Estate Assets 
  Columbia Property Trust is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its depreciable assets. Columbia Property Trust considers the period of future benefit of the asset to determine the appropriate useful lives. These assessments have a direct impact on net income. The estimated useful lives of its assets by class are as follows: 
                   Buildings 
       
    40 years 
      Building and site improvements 
       
    5-25 years 
      Tenant improvements 
       
    Shorter of economic life or lease term 
      Intangible lease assets 
       
    Lease term 

Evaluating the Recoverability of Real Estate Assets 
  Columbia Property Trust continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate and related intangible assets, of both operating properties and properties under construction, in which Columbia Property Trust has an ownership interest, either directly or through investments in joint ventures, may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present that suggest that the carrying amounts of real estate assets and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable, Columbia Property Trust assesses the recoverability of these assets and liabilities by determining whether the respective carrying values will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying values, Columbia Property Trust adjusts the carrying value of the real estate assets and related intangible assets and liabilities to the estimated fair values, pursuant to the property, plant, and equipment accounting standard for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, and recognizes an impairment loss. Estimated fair values are calculated based on the following information, in order of preference, depending upon availability: (i) recently quoted market prices, (ii) market prices for comparable properties, or (iii) the present value of future cash flows, including estimated residual value. Certain of Columbia Property Trust's assets may be carried at more than an amount that could be realized in a current disposition transaction. Columbia Property Trust has determined that there is   no   impairment in the carrying values of our real estate assets and related intangible assets as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Projections of expected future operating cash flows require that Columbia Property Trust estimate future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements, property operating expenses, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, and the number of years the property is held for investment, among other factors. The subjectivity of assumptions used in the future cash flow analysis, including discount rates, could result in an incorrect assessment of the property's fair value and could result in the misstatement of the carrying value of Columbia Property Trust's real estate assets and related intangible assets and liabilities and net income. 
  Assets Held for Sale 
  Columbia Property Trust classifies assets as held for sale according to ASC 360,   Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets   ("ASC 360"). According to ASC 360, assets are considered held for sale when the following criteria are met: 
             
    Management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property. 
                
    The property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such property. 
                
    An active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the property have been initiated. 
                
    The property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. 
                
    Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. 
                
    The sale of the property is probable (i.e. typically subject to a binding sale contract with a non-refundable deposit), and transfer of the property is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year. 
     At such time that a property is determined to be held for sale, its carrying amount is adjusted to the lower of its depreciated book value or its estimated fair value, less costs to sell, and depreciation is no longer recognized; and assets and liabilities are required to be classified as held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Key Center Tower and the Key Center Marriott and the 9127 South Jamaica Street building were subject to binding sale contracts and met the other aforementioned criteria; thus these properties are classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of  
  
   Page 11 

that date. The sale of the 9127 South Jamaica Street building closed on October 12, 2016 (see Note 3,   Real Estate Transactions  ). The Key Center Tower and the Key Center Marriott transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  , are provided below (in thousands): 

Intangible Assets and Liabilities Arising from In-Place Leases where Columbia Property Trust Is the Lessor 
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, Columbia Property Trust allocates the purchase price of the properties to tangible assets, consisting of land, building, site improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases, based in each case on Columbia Property Trust's estimate of their fair values in accordance with ASC 820 (see Fair Value Measurements section above for additional detail). As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Columbia Property Trust had the following intangible in-place lease assets and liabilities (in thousands): 

Page 12 

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Columbia Property Trust recognized the following amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities (in thousands): 

The remaining net intangible assets and liabilities, as of   September 30, 2016  , will be amortized as follows (in thousands): 

Intangible Assets and Liabilities Arising from In-Place Leases where Columbia Property Trust Is the Lessee 
  Columbia Property Trust is the lessee on certain in-place ground leases. Intangible above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as intangible lease liabilities and assets, respectively, and are amortized as an adjustment to property operating cost over the remaining term of the respective leases. Columbia Property Trust had gross below-market lease assets of approximately  
  $140.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and recognized amortization of these assets of approximately   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and approximately   $1.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining net below-market intangible lease assets will be amortized as follows (in thousands): 

Page 13 

Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
  Columbia Property Trust enters into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate its interest rate risk on the related financial instruments. Columbia Property Trust does not enter into derivative or interest rate swap transactions for speculative purposes; however, certain of its derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Columbia Property Trust records the fair value of its interest rate swaps either as prepaid expenses and other assets or as accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued capital expenditures. Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as other comprehensive income, while changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge, if any, are recognized currently in earnings. All changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as gain (loss) on interest rate swaps. Amounts received or paid under interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expense for contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and as gain (loss) on interest rate swaps for contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The following tables provide additional information related to Columbia Property Trust's interest rate swaps (in thousands): 

Columbia Property Trust applied the provisions of ASC 820 in recording its interest rate swaps at fair value. The fair values of the interest rate swaps, classified under Level 2, were determined using a third-party proprietary model that is based on prevailing market data for contracts with matching durations, current and anticipated London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") information, and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions. Columbia Property Trust has determined that the fair value, as determined by the third party, is reasonable.  

During the periods presented, there was no hedge ineffectiveness required to be recognized into earnings on the interest rate swaps that qualified for hedge accounting treatment. 
  Income Taxes 
  Columbia Property Trust has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and has operated as such beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2003. To qualify as a REIT, Columbia Property Trust must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least   90%   of its REIT taxable income, as defined by the Code, to its stockholders. As a REIT, Columbia Property Trust generally is not subject to income tax on income it distributes to stockholders. Columbia Property Trust's stockholder distributions typically exceed its taxable income due to the inclusion of noncash expenses, such as depreciation, in taxable income. As a result, Columbia Property Trust typically does not incur federal income taxes other than as described in the following paragraph. Columbia Property Trust is, however, subject to certain state and local taxes related to the operations of properties in certain locations, which have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
  Columbia Property Trust TRS, LLC ("Columbia Property Trust TRS"), Columbia KCP TRS, LLC ("Columbia KCP TRS"), and Columbia Energy TRS, LLC ("Columbia Energy TRS") (collectively, the "TRS Entities") are wholly owned subsidiaries of Columbia Property Trust, are organized as Delaware limited liability companies, and operate, among other things, office properties that Columbia Property Trust does not intend to hold long term and a full-service hotel. Columbia Property Trust has elected to treat the TRS Entities as taxable REIT subsidiaries. Columbia Property Trust may perform certain additional, noncustomary services for tenants of its buildings through the TRS Entities; however, any earnings related to such services are subject to federal and state income taxes. In addition, for Columbia Property Trust to continue to qualify as a REIT, Columbia Property Trust must limit its investments in taxable REIT subsidiaries to   25%   of the value of the total assets. The TRS Entities' deferred tax assets and  
  
   Page 14 

liabilities represent temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on the enacted rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. If applicable, Columbia Property Trust records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued   ASU 2016-15, Classification of Cash Receipts and Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"), which addresses the statement of cash flow classification requirements for several types of receipts and payments. ASU 2016-15 provides that, among other things, (i) debt prepayments and extinguishment costs should be classified as financing activities, (ii) insurance proceeds should be classified in accordance with the nature of the respective claims, and (iii) distributions from equity method investees should be classified based on the underlying nature of the investee activity according to specific guidelines. ASU 2016-15 is effective for Columbia Property Trust on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-15 is not expected to materially impact Columbia Property Trust's accounting policies, or its financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-02, Leases   ("ASU 2016-02"), which amends the existing standards for lease accounting by requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets, and making targeted changes to lessor accounting and reporting. The new standard will require lessees to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months, and classify such leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method (finance leases), or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (operating leases). Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance as applies to sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 supersedes previous leasing standards. ASU 2016-02 is effective for Columbia Property Trust for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Columbia Property Trust is evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial position and results of operations.

4.    Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  Columbia Property Trust owns a majority interest of   51%   in the Market Square Joint Venture, and Blackstone owns the remaining   49%   interest in the joint venture. The Market Square Joint Venture owns and operates the Market Square Buildings through Market Square REIT East   West, LLC, which operates as a REIT. The Market Square Buildings are   two  , 13-story office buildings containing   698,000   square feet of office space in Washington, D.C. (the "Market Square Buildings") Columbia Property Trust shares substantive participation rights with Blackstone, including management selection and termination, and the approval of material operating and capital decisions. As such, Columbia Property Trust uses the equity method of accounting to record its investment in the Market Square Joint Venture. Under the equity method, the investment in the joint venture is recorded at cost and adjusted for cash contributions and distributions, and allocations of income (loss). Cash distributions and earnings are allocated according to the provisions of the joint venture agreement, which are consistent with the ownership percentages for the Market Square Joint Venture.  
  Columbia Property Trust evaluates the recoverability of its investment in unconsolidated joint venture in accordance with accounting standards for equity investments by first reviewing the investment for any indicators of impairment. If indicators are present, Columbia Property Trust estimates the fair value of the investment. If the carrying value of the investment is greater than the estimated fair value, management makes an assessment of whether the impairment is "temporary" or "other-than-temporary." In making this assessment, management considers the following: (1) the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost, and (2) Columbia Property Trust's intent and ability to retain its interest long enough for a recovery in market value. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance on the interest-only Market Square mortgage note is   $325.0 million  , bearing interest at   5.07%  . The Market Square mortgage note matures on July 1, 2023. On October 28, 2015, Columbia Property Trust entered into a guaranty of a   $25.0 million   portion of the Market Square mortgage note, the amount of which has been reduced to   $23.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , as a result of leasing at the Market Square Buildings. The amount of the guaranty will continue to be reduced as space is leased.

Columbia Property Trust provides property and asset management services to the Market Square Joint Venture. Under these agreements, Columbia Property Trust oversees the day-to-day operations of the Market Square Joint Venture and the Market Square Buildings, including property management, property accounting, and other property services. Columbia Property Trust receives property management fees equal to   3.0%   of the gross revenue of the Market Square Buildings and reimbursements of property operating costs, payable monthly, and receives asset management fees of   $1.0 million   annually, payable in equal quarterly installments. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Columbia Property Trust earned   $0.6 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively, in fees related to these asset and property management services, which are included in other property income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Market Square Joint Venture was formed in October 2015, so similar fees were not earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.1 million   in property management fees were due from the Market Square Joint Venture, and included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
   
  5.    Line of Credit and Notes Payable 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Columbia Property Trust had the following line of credit and notes payable indebtedness (excluding bonds payable; see Note 6,   Bonds Payable  ) in thousands: 

Fair Value of Debt 
  The estimated fair value of Columbia Property Trust's line of credit and notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was approximately   $829.4 million   and   $1,140.1 million  , respectively. The related carrying value of the line of credit and notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was   $825.0 million   and   $1,135.1 million  , respectively. Columbia Property Trust estimated the fair value of the   $300   Million Term Loan (the "  $300   Million Term Loan") and the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") by obtaining estimates for similar facilities from multiple market participants as of the respective reporting dates. Therefore, the fair values determined are considered to be based on observable market data for similar instruments (Level 2). The fair values of all other debt instruments were estimated based on discounted cash flow analyses using the current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the respective reporting dates. The discounted cash flow method of assessing fair value results in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.  
  Interest Paid and Capitalized and Debt Covenants 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Columbia Property Trust made interest payments totaling approximately   $21.7 million   and   $43.4 million  , respectively, of which approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million   were capitalized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , Columbia Property Trust believes it was in compliance with the restrictive financial covenants on its term loans, the Revolving Credit Facility, and notes payable obligations. 
  Debt Repayments 
  Subsequent to quarter end, Columbia Property Trust used proceeds from the 80 Park Plaza Property sale to fully repay the  Revolving Credit Facility balance of   $99.0 million  .

Columbia Property Trust OP received net proceeds from the 2026 Bonds Payable of   $346.4 million  , which were used to redeem   $250.0 million   of   seven  -year, unsecured   5.875%   senior notes due April 2018 (the "2018 Bonds Payable"), including a   $17.9 million   make-whole payment reflected as an early loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The remaining net proceeds were used to repay borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. The 2026 Bonds Payable require   semi-annual   interest payments in February and August based on a contractual annual interest rate of   3.650%  . In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, the 2026 Bonds Payable are shown net of the initial issuance discount of approximately   $1.3 million  , which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2026 Bonds Payable using the effective interest method. The principal amount of the 2026 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, August 15, 2026.  
  In March 2015, Columbia Property Trust OP issued   $350.0 million   of   ten  -year, unsecured   4.150%   senior notes at   99.859%   of their face value (the "2025 Bonds Payable"), which are guaranteed by Columbia Property Trust. Columbia Property Trust OP received proceeds from the 2025 Bonds Payable, net of fees, of   $347.2 million  . The 2025 Bonds Payable require   semi-annual   interest payments in April and October based on a contractual annual interest rate of   4.150%  . In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, the 2025 Bonds Payable are shown net of the initial issuance discount of approximately   $0.5 million  , which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Bonds Payable using the effective interest method. The principal amount of the 2025 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date,   April 1, 2025  .  
  Interest payments of   $20.8 million   were made on the 2018 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and interest payments of   $7.3 million   were made on the 2018 Bonds Payable during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Columbia Property Trust is subject to substantially similar covenants under the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable. As of   September 30, 2016  , Columbia Property Trust believes it was in compliance with the restrictive financial covenants on the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable was approximately   $703.2 million  , and as of   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of the 2025 Bonds Payable and the 2018 Bonds Payable was approximately   $602.3 million  . The related carrying value of the bonds payable, net of discounts, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was   $698.3 million   and   $599.0 million  , respectively. The fair value of the bonds payable was estimated based on discounted cash flow analyses using the current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings as the bonds as of the respective reporting dates (Level 2). The discounted cash flow method of assessing fair value results in a general approximation of value, which may differ from the price that could be achieved in a market transaction. 
   
           7.  
    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Commitments Under Existing Lease Agreements 
  Certain lease agreements include provisions that, at the option of the tenant, may obligate Columbia Property Trust to expend capital to expand an existing property or provide other expenditures for the benefit of the tenant. As of   September 30, 2016  , Columbia Property Trust is committed, under a recently signed lease, to contribute approximately   $70.1 million   toward leasehold improvements at our 222 East 41st Street property, which is expected to be paid during 2016 and 2017. 
  Guaranty of Debt of Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  Upon entering into the Market Square Joint Venture in October 2015, Columbia Property Trust entered into a guaranty of a   $25.0 million   portion of the Market Square mortgage note, the amount of which is reduced as space is leased. As a result of leasing the guaranty has been reduced to   $23.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Columbia Property Trust believes that the likelihood of  
  
   Page 20 

     Table of Contents  

making a payment under this guaranty is remote; therefore, no liability has been recorded related to this guaranty as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Litigation 
  Columbia Property Trust is subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which are expected to be covered by liability insurance. Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any reasonably possible loss relating to these matters using the latest information available. Columbia Property Trust records a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, Columbia Property Trust accrues the best estimate within the range. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, Columbia Property Trust accrues the minimum amount within the range. If an unfavorable outcome is probable but the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, Columbia Property Trust discloses the nature of the litigation and indicates that an estimate of the loss or range of loss cannot be made. If an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the estimated loss is material, Columbia Property Trust discloses the nature and estimate of the possible loss of the litigation. Columbia Property Trust does not disclose information with respect to litigation where the possibility of an unfavorable outcome is considered to be remote. Based on current expectations, such matters, both individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, business, or financial condition of Columbia Property Trust. Columbia Property Trust is not currently involved in any legal proceedings of which management would consider the outcome to be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Columbia Property Trust.

  Long-Term Incentive Plan

  The 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable (see Note 6,   Bonds Payable  ) were issued by Columbia Property Trust OP, and are guaranteed by Columbia Property Trust. In accordance with SEC Rule 3-10(c), Columbia Property Trust includes herein condensed consolidating financial information in lieu of separate financial statements of the subsidiary issuer (Columbia Property Trust OP), as defined in the bond indentures, because all of the following criteria are met:  
           (1)  
    The subsidiary issuer (Columbia Property Trust OP)  is   100%   owned by the parent company guarantor (Columbia Property Trust);  
              (2)  
    The guarantee is full and unconditional; and  
              (3)  
    No other subsidiary of the parent company guarantor (Columbia Property Trust) guarantees the 2026 Bonds Payable or the 2025 Bonds Payable.   
     Columbia Property Trust uses the equity method with respect to its investment in subsidiaries included in its condensed consolidating financial statements. Set forth below are Columbia Property Trust's condensed consolidating balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands), as well as its condensed consolidating statements of operations and its condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands); and its condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands).

           ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements (and notes thereto) and the "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" preceding Part I of this report, as well as our consolidated financial statements (and the notes thereto) and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
  Executive Summary  
  Our primary strategic objective is to generate long-term shareholder returns through a combination of steadily growing cash flows and appreciation in our net asset values, with a focus on high-barrier-to-entry markets. Capital recycling initiatives are enabling us to improve our concentration in key markets and central business districts, as well as to reduce our exposure to single-tenant assets. During 2015 and 2016, we have sold 16 properties situated in outlying markets for approximately $1.0 billion, and reinvested those proceeds in acquisitions in New York and Boston, and targeted capital improvements. We are continuing to explore the sale of additional non-core assets and pursue additional investment opportunities in our key markets, which will allow us to increase our portfolio allocations to central business districts and multi-tenant buildings, and at the same time, optimize our portfolio allocation between traditional, stabilized core investments and growth-oriented, value-add investments. While transitioning the portfolio to more growth-oriented, value-add properties is likely to cause some dilution in earnings for a period of time, we believe that this transition will improve the opportunity for growth over the longer term. 
  We are continuing to proactively manage our upcoming lease expirations. During 2016, we have leased   783,752   square feet of space. In April, we executed a 30-year, full building lease of 390,000-square feet at the 222 East 41st Street property in New York, which replaces a lease for the majority of the building that was scheduled to expire later this year; and in June we executed a  130,000-square foot lease renewal at the SanTan Corporate Center in Phoenix, Arizona, resulting in a slight rent roll up, with a long-time tenant occupying the entirety of one of the two buildings at the property; and a 35,000-square-foot lease at the 315 Park Avenue South Building in New York, which brought the property to 97% leased. 
  We continue to support a flexible balance sheet by maintaining low leverage, with an emphasis on unsecured borrowings. During 2015 and 2016, we have refinanced approximately $1.3 billion of unsecured debt and repaid $371.5 million of mortgage loans. As a result, over this period we have extended our weighted-average debt maturity from 3.3 years to 6.3 years   (1)   , decreased our weighted-average cost of borrowing from 4.24% per annum to 3.61%   (1)    per annum, and increased our unencumbered pool of assets as a percentage of gross real estate assets from 61.7% to 79.5%   (1)   . Our  board has adopted a stock repurchase program that authorizes us to purchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock through September of 2017. We believe such a program enables us to benefit from market downturns, which may cause our stock to be undervalued from time to time. To date, we have purchased an aggregate of   $41.3 million   of common stock, including $25.0 million purchased in early 2016. 
            (1)   
    Statistics (i) include 51% of the debt held by the the Market Square Joint Venture, in which we own a 51% interest, and (ii) are adjusted for the repayment of the outstanding balance of our Revolving Credit Facility of $99.0 million, which occurred on October 3, 2016.

Key Performance Indicators 
  Our operating results depend primarily upon the level of income generated by the leases at our properties. Occupancy and rental rates are critical drivers of our lease income. Over the last year, our average portfolio percentage leased ranged from 90.6% to 93.3%. The following table sets forth details related to recent leasing activities, which drive changes in our rental revenues: 

(1)   
    Includes 51% of renewal leasing at the Market Square Joint Venture, in which we own a 51% interest. There was 41,000 square feet of renewal leasing quarter to date and 57,000 square feet of renewal leasing year to date at the Market Square Buildings. 
               (2)   
    Includes 51% of new leasing at the Market Square Joint Venture, in which we own a 51% interest. There was 3,000 square feet of new leasing quarter to date and 12,000 square feet of new leasing year to date at the Market Square Buildings. 
               (3)   
    Rent leasing spreads for renewal leases are calculated based on the change in base rental income measured on a straight-line basis. 
               (4)   
    Rent leasing spreads for new leases are calculated only for properties that have been vacant less than one year, and are measured on a straight-line basis. 
      In 2015, rent leasing spreads were positive due to a lease expansion and extension with the anchor tenant at our 221 Main Street building in San Francisco, California and a new lease for 45,000 square feet at 315 Park Avenue South in New York. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, rent leasing spreads increased, primarily due to an 11,000-square foot, 9-year lease renewal at our 650 California Street property (138%). Over the next 12 months, approximately 983,000 square feet of our leases (approximately 11% of our office portfolio based on revenues) are scheduled to expire. Approximately 451,000 of this total relates to properties currently being marketed for sale. The remainder of the near-term expirations primarily relate to our properties in New York and San Francisco. Overall, we expect to replace these leases with starting rates above those currently in place at the properties. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  Cash flows generated from the operation of our properties are primarily used to fund recurring expenditures and stockholder dividends. Our board of directors elected to maintain the quarterly stockholder distribution rate of $0.30 per share for the   third   quarter of 2016. The amount of distributions to common stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors, including funds deemed available for distribution based principally on our current and future projected operating cash flows, reduced by capital requirements necessary to maintain our existing portfolio. In determining the amount of distributions to common stockholders, we also consider our future capital needs and future sources of liquidity, as well as the annual distribution requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. Investments in new property acquisitions and first-generation capital improvements are generally funded with capital proceeds from property sales, debt, or cash on hand.  
  
   Page 34 

Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated net cash flows from operating activities of   $149.7 million  , which consists primarily of receipts from tenants for rent and reimbursements, reduced by payments for operating costs, administrative expenses, and interest expense. During the same period, we paid total distributions to stockholders of   $148.5 million  , which includes dividend payments of $37.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and $111.1 million for the first three quarters of 2016. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued the 2026 Bonds Payable, generating net proceeds of   $348.7 million  , which were used to prepay our $250 million 2018 Bonds Payable, originally due in April 2018, and for the related early redemption premium. The remaining bond proceeds and the net proceeds of   $482.1 million   from current year property dispositions were used to pay down the outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility, to repay the $119.0 million remaining on the $300 Million Bridge Loan, to repay the $39.0 million SanTan Corporate Center mortgage notes, to fund   $54.2 million   of leasing and capital projects, and to redeem $26.2 million of our common stock.   
  Over the short-term, we expect our primary sources of capital to be operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and future debt financings. We expect that our principal demands for funds will be operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, capital improvements to our existing assets, stock repurchases, property acquisitions, and interest and principal payments on current and maturing debt. We believe that we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our current obligations as they come due. We used the proceeds from 80 Park Plaza disposition, which closed on September 30, 2016, to fully pay down the remaining balance on our Revolving Credit Facility after quarter end. As a result, we have access to the full $500.0 million capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility as of October 25, 2016. 
  Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Over the long term, we expect that our primary sources of capital will include operating cash flows, select property dispositions, and proceeds from secured or unsecured borrowings. We expect that our primary uses of capital will continue to include stockholder distributions; acquisitions; capital expenditures, such as building improvements, tenant improvements, and leasing costs; and repaying or refinancing debt.  
  Consistent with our financing objectives and operational strategy, we continue to maintain debt levels historically less than 40% of the undepreciated cost of our assets. Our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio is calculated using the consolidated outstanding debt balance and  real estate at cost. As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt-to-real-estate-asset ratio, including 51% of the debt and real estate at the Market Square Joint venture, in which we own a 51% interest, was approximately 35.7%. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  The Revolving Credit Facility has a capacity of $500.0 million and matures in July 2019, with two, six-month extension options. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an outstanding balance of   $99.0 million   on the Revolving Credit Facility, which was repaid subsequent to quarter end. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.55% for LIBOR borrowings, or an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.55% for base-rate borrowings, based on our applicable credit rating. The per-annum facility fee on the aggregate revolving commitment (used or unused) ranges from 0.125% to 0.30%, also based on our applicable credit rating. Additionally, we have the ability to increase the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility, along with the $300 Million Term Loan, which provides for four accordion options for an aggregate amount of up to $400 million, subject to certain limitations.  
  Term Loans 
  The $300 Million Term Loan matures in July 2020 and, along with the Revolving Credit Facility, provides for four accordion options for an aggregate amount of up to $400 million, subject to certain conditions. The $300 Million Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.90% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% for base-rate loans, based on our applicable credit rating.  
  The $150 Million Term Loan matures in July 2022 (the "$150 Million Term Loan"). The $150 Million Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.40% to 2.35% for LIBOR loans, or (ii) an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.40% to 1.35% for base-rate loans. The interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed with an interest rate swap agreement. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap and our current credit rating, the interest rate on the $150 Million Term Loan is effectively fixed at 3.52%.  
  Bonds Payable 
  In August 2016, we issued $350.0 million of ten-year, unsecured 3.650% senior notes at 99.626% of their face value under our Universal Shelf Registration Statement (defined below). We received proceeds from the 2026 Bonds Payable, net of fees, of $346.4  
  
   Page 35 

million, which were used to prepay our $250 million 2018 Bonds Payable, originally due in April of 2018. The 2026 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in February and August based on a contractual annual interest rate of 3.650%. The principal amount of the 2026 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, August 15, 2026.  
  In March 2015, we issued $350.0 million of ten-year, unsecured 4.150% senior notes at 99.859% of their face value under our Universal Shelf Registration Statement (defined below). We received proceeds from the 2025 Bonds Payable, net of fees, of $347.2 million. The 2025 Bonds Payable require semi-annual interest payments in April and October based on a contractual annual interest rate of 4.150%. The principal amount of the 2025 Bonds Payable is due and payable on the maturity date, April 1, 2025.  
  Debt Covenants       
  Our portfolio debt instruments, the $300 Million Term Loan, the $150 Million Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility, the 2026 Bonds Payable and the 2025 Bonds Payable contain certain covenants and restrictions that require us to meet certain financial ratios. We believe we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect to continue to be able to meet the requirements of our debt covenants over the next 12 months.  
  Universal Shelf Registration Statement 
  We have on file a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-198764) with the SEC (the "Universal Shelf Registration Statement"), which was effective upon filing in September 2014. The Universal Shelf Registration Statement provides us with future flexibility to offer, from time to time and in one or more offerings, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, or any combination thereof. The terms of any such future offerings would be established at the time of an offering. 
  Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our contractual obligations will become payable in the following periods (in thousands): 

(1)   
    Includes 51% of the debt and interest obligations for the Market Square Joint Venture, in which we own a 51% interest. The Market Square Joint Venture holds a $325 million mortgage note on the Market Square Buildings, bearing interest at 5.07% and maturing on July 1, 2023. We guarantee $23.3 million of the Market Square Buildings note payable (see Note 7,   Commitments   Contingencies  , to the accompanying financial statements). 
               (2)   
    Interest obligations on variable-rate debt are measured at the rate at which they are effectively fixed with interest rate swap agreements (where applicable). Interest obligations on all other debt are measured at the contractual rate. See Item 3,   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk,   for more information regarding our interest rate swaps. 
               (3)   
    Amounts include principal obligations only. We made interest payments on these obligations of $5.4 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , all of which was funded with interest income earned on the corresponding investments in development authority bonds. These obligations will be fully satisfied at maturity with equivalent investments in development authority bonds. 
               (4)   
    Reflects obligations related to ground leases at certain properties, as describe in Note 2,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  . In addition to the amounts shown, certain lease agreements include provisions that, at the option of the tenant, may obligate us to expend capital to expand an existing property or provide other expenditures for the benefit of the tenant, including a commitment to contribute   $70.1 million   toward leasehold improvements. See Note 7,   Commitments and Contingencies  , for more information.

Results of Operations  
  Overview 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned controlling interests in   24   office properties and one hotel. As of   September 30, 2016  , our office properties, including   51%   of the Market Square Joint Venture, in which Columbia Property Trust owns a   51%   interest, were approximately   90.7%   leased, excluding the 9127 South Jamaica Street building, which was subsequently sold on October  12, 2016 (see Note 3, Real Estate Transactions). Our operating results are impacted by recent acquisition, disposition, and joint venture activity, as set forth below. In the near-term, we expect real estate operating income to fluctuate, primarily based on acquisitions, dispositions, and leasing activities.

Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   with the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Rental income was   $87.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $107.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily due to transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($8.7 million); dispositions ($8.1 million); and vacancy at our 222 East 41st Street property ($5.8 million) as the full building is being prepared for NYU's Langone Medical lease to commence in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional rental income from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015 ($3.2 million). We expect future rental income to fluctuate based on leasing, acquisition, and disposition activity. 
  Tenant reimbursements and property operating costs were   $17.1 million   and   $39.1 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which reflects a proportional decrease as compared with   $22.6 million   and   $46.5 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in tenant reimbursements is due to the transfer of the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($2.2 million); dispositions ($2.0 million); and vacancy at our 222 East 41st Street property ($1.4 million) as the full building is being prepared for NYU's Langone Medical lease to commence in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional tenant reimbursements from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building ($1.0 million). The decrease in property operating costs is also due to the transfer of the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($5.0 million) and dispositions ($3.3 million), partially offset by additional property operating costs from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building ($1.7 million). Tenant reimbursements and property operating costs are expected to fluctuate with leasing activity and changes in our portfolio.  
  Hotel income, net of hotel operating costs, was   $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $1.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a higher level of occupancy and corporate events at the hotel in the third quarter of 2015. The Key Center Marriott is under a firm sales contract, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Other property income was   $2.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents an increase as compared with   $1.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  ,     primarily due to an early termination at our 222 East 41st Street property ($0.6 million) and management fees earned from the Market Square Joint Venture in 2016 ($0.6 million), as described in Note 4,   Unconsolidated Joint Venture  . The terminated space  at our 222 East 41st Street property has been relet in a full-building lease, expected to commence later in 2016. Future other property income is expected to fluctuate, primarily as a result of lease restructuring and termination activities.  
  Asset and property management fees were   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2015. Future asset and prop  erty management fees are expected to fluctuate primarily based on future acquisition and disposition activity.    
  Depreciation was   $26.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease a  s c  ompared with   $32.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($3.4 million) and dispositions ($3.1 million), partially offset by additional depreciation from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015 ($0.7 million). Excluding the impact of additional acquisitions and dispositions, depreciation is expected to increase in future periods due to ongoing capital improvements at our existing properties. 
  Amortization w  as     $11.9 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , which represen  ts a decrease as     compared with     $20.3 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily due to dispositions ($3.6 million); the expiration of leases ($2.4 million); the early termination of the lease at our 222 East 41st Street property ($1.3 million); and transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($1.3 million), partially offset by additional amortization from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015 ($0.8 million).     We expect future amortization to fluctuate primarily as a result of future leasing activity, acquisitions, and dispositions. 
  General and administrative expenses wer  e     $7.5 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2016  , which represe  nts an increase as compa  red with     $6.8 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the continued development of our regional management and investment platform. We expect future general and administrative expenses to remain at similar levels over the near-term. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred total acquisition expenses of   $1.7 million   in connection with acquiring the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015. See Note 3,   Real Estate Transactions  , of the accompanying financial statements for details of this acquisitions. We expect future acquisition expenses to fluctuate with acquisition activity. 
  Interest expense was   $17.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $22.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to transferring the Market Square mortgage note to

     Table of Contents  

a joint venture ($4.1 million); the repayment of mortgage notes ($0.7 million); and a bridge loan outstanding during the third quarter of 2015 ($0.7 million), partially reduced by the impact of the 2026 Bonds Payable ($0.6 million). We expect interest expense to continue to decrease slightly in the near-term as disposition proceeds are used to reduce borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Interest and other income was stable at   $1.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Interest income is expected to remain at comparable levels in future periods, as the majority of this income is earned on investments in development authority bonds with a remaining term of approximately 5.3 years as of   September 30, 2016  . Interest income earned on development authority bonds is entirely offset by interest expense incurred on the corresponding capital leases. 
  We recognized a loss on interest rate swaps of   $1.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , related to the 333 Market Street Building mortgage note, which was repaid in June 2015. We do not anticipate gains and losses on interest rate swaps in the near-term, as our only interest rate swap is accounted for as a hedge; thus, changes in the market value are recorded to other comprehensive income. 
  We recognized a loss on early extinguishm  ent of debt o  f   $18.9 million   and   $2.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In September 2016, we repaid our 2018 Bonds Payable 1.6 years early, using proceeds from the 2026 Bonds Payable, resulting in an early redemption premium of $17.9 million and the write-off of related deferred financing costs. The 2015 loss was primarily due to a prepayment premium to settle the 215 Diehl Road building mortgage note in connection with selling the property in the 11 Property Sale. We expect future gains or losses on early extinguishments of debt to fluctuate with financing activities. 
  We recognized a loss from unconsolidated joint ventur  e     of   $1.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as real estate operating income from the Market Square Buildings was reduced by interest incurred on the property's $325 million mortgage note.   Future income or loss from unconsolidated joint venture will fluctuate with leasing and other operating activities at the Market Square Buildings. 
  Net Income 
  Net income was   $36.9 million  , or   $0.30   per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents an increase as compared with   $20.1 million  , or   $0.16   per basic and     diluted share, for the three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase is due to additional quarter-over-quarter gains on sales of real estate (  $30.2 million  ), partially offset by additional loss on early extinguishment of debt (  $16.2 million  ) related to replacing our $250.0 million 2018 unsecured bonds payable at 5.875% with $350.0 million of 2026 unsecured bonds payable at 3.650%, in the third quarter of 2016. S  ee the "Supplemental Performance Measures" section below for our same store results compared with the prior year. We expect future earnings to fluctuate as   a result of leasing activity at our existing properties, our planned near-term dispositions, and acquisition activity. 
   
  Comparison of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Rental income was     $280.7 million     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , which represen  ts a decrease as   compared with     $332.7 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2015  .     The decrease is primarily due to dispositions ($38.4 million); transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($28.3 million); and vacancy at our 222 East 41st Street property ($5.7 million) as the full building is being prepared for NYU's Langone Medical lease to commence in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by additional rental income from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015 ($19.9 million). We expect future rental income to fluctuate based on leasing, acquisition, and disposition activity. 
  Tenant reimbursements and property operating costs wer  e     $55.6 million   and   $120.7 million  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which reflects a proportional decrease a  s compared with     $77.4 million     and     $144.4 million  , res  pectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .     The decrease in tenant reimbursements is due to dispositions ($11.5 million) and the transfer of the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($8.6 million), partially offset by additional tenant reimbursements from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building ($2.9 million). The decrease in property operating costs is also due to dispositions ($16.3 million) and the transfer of the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($14.9 million), partially offset by additional property operating costs from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building ($6.9 million).   Tenant reimburseme  nts and property operating costs are expected to fluctuate with leasing activity and changes in our portfolio.  
  Hotel income, net of hotel operating costs, was   $3.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $3.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a higher level of group bookings and meetings at the hotel in 2015. The Key Center Marriott is under a firm sales contract, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Other property inco  me was     $14.0 million     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , which represents   an increase as     compared with     $4.4 million     for the     nine     month  s ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an early termination at our 222 East 41st Street property ($6.2 million) and management fees earned from the Market Square Joint Venture in 2016 ($1.9 million), as described in Note 4,   Unconsolidated Joint Venture  . The terminated space has been relet in a full-building lease expected to commence later in 2016. Future oth  er property income is expected to fluctuate, primarily as a result of lease restructuring and termination activities.    
  Asset and property management fees were   $1.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $1.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2015. Future asset   and property manageme  nt fees are expected to fluctuate with future acquisition and disposition activity.  
  Depreciation     was     $84.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as   compared with     $100.3 million     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to dispositions ($12.8 million) and transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($10.6 million), partially offset by additional depreciation from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015 ($5.4 million). Excluding the impact of additional acquisitions and dispositions,     depreciation is expected to increase in future periods due to ongoing capital     improvements at our existing properties. 
  Amortization   wa  s   $42.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $67.2 million   for the   nine     months ended     September 30, 2015  .     The decrease is primarily due to dispositions ($13.5 million); the expiration of leases ($8.1 million); and transferring the Market Square Buildings to a joint venture ($5.6 million); partially offset by additional amortization from the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015 ($3.5 million).     We expect future amortization to fluctuate primarily as a result of future leasing activity, acquisitions, and dispositions. 
  General and administrative expenses w  e  re   $25.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents an increase as compared with   $21.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is due to costs incurred to develop our regional management and investment platform ($3.1 million) and bad debt expenses ($0.5 million). We expect future general and administrative expenses to remain stable over the near-term. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred total acquisition expenses of   $3.7 million   in connection with acquiring three properties in January 2015 and the 229 West 43rd Street Building in August 2015. See Note 3,   Real Estate Transactions  , of the accompanying financial statements for details of these acquisitions. We expect future acquisition expenses to fluctuate with acquisition activity. 
  Interest expense was   $52.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents a decrease as compared with   $66.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to transferring the Market Square mortgage note to a joint venture ($12.4 million) and repaying mortgage loans ($4.7 million), partially offset by the net impact of the issuance of bonds in March 2015 and August 2016 ($3.5 million). We expect interest expense to continue to decrease slightly in the near-term as disposition proceeds are used to reduce borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Interest and other income was stable at   $5.5 million   and   $5.4 million   for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  , respectively. Interest income is expected to remain at comparable levels in future periods, as the majority of this income is earned on investments in development authority bonds with a remaining term of approxima  tely 5.3 years   as of     September 30, 2016  . Interest income earned on development authority bonds is entirely offset by interest expense incurred on the corr  esponding capital leases. 
  We recognized a loss on interest rate swaps of   $1.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , related to the 333 Market Street Building mortgage note, which was repaid in June 2015. We do not anticipate gains and losses on interest rate swaps in the near-term, as our only interest rate swap is accounted for as a hedge; thus, changes in the market value  are recorded to other comprehensive income. 
  We recognized a loss on early extinguishm  ent of debt o  f   $19.0 million   and   $3.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In April 2016, we repaid a bridge loan used to finance a portion of the acquisition of the 229 West 43rd Street Building approximately three months early, and in September 2016, we repaid our 2018 Bonds Payable 1.6 years early, using proceeds from the 2026 Bonds Payable. In March 2015, we repaid a bridge loan used to finance acquisitions in January of 2015 approximately four months early. The bond pay off in 2016 resulted in an early redemption premium of $17.9 million, and all of the early repayments resulted in the write-off of related deferred financing costs. We expect future gains or losses on early extinguishments of debt to fluctuate with financing activities. 
  We recognized a loss from unconsolidated joint v  ent  ure of   $5.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as real estate operating income from the Market Square Buildings was reduced by interest incurred on the property's $325 million mortgage note.     Future income or loss from unconsolidated joint venture wi  ll fluctuate with operating activity at the Market Square Buildings.

Net Income 
  Net income wa  s     $56.9 million  , o  r   $0.46   per basic and diluted share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents an increase as compared with   $34.5 million  , or   $0.28   per basic and diluted share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase is due to additional year-over-year gains on sales of real estate (  $29.9 million  ), partially offset by an net increase in interest expense and other financing costs, including amounts related to our interest in the Market Square Joint Venture ($8.2 million). See "Supplemental Performance Measures" section below for our same store results compared with the prior year period. We expect future earnings to fluctuate as a result of leasing activity at our existing properties, our planned near-term dispositions, and acquisition activity. 
   
  Supplemental Performance Measures 
  In addition to net income, we measure the performance of the company using certain non-GAAP supplemental performance measures, including:  (i) Funds From Operations ("FFO"), (ii) Net Operating Income ("NOI"), and (iii) Same Store Net Operating Income ("Same Store NOI"). These non-GAAP metrics are commonly used by industry analysts and investors as supplemental operation performance measures of REITs and are viewed by management to be useful indicators of operating performance.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Management believes that the use of FFO, NOI, and Same Store NOI, combined with net income, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. 
  Net income is the most comparable GAAP measure to FFO, NOI, and Same Store NOI. Each of these supplemental performance measures exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.  
  Funds From Operations  
  FFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts who follow the real estate industry to measure the performance of an equity REIT. We consider FFO a useful measure of our performance because it principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, is beneficial in improving our investors' understanding of our operating results and allowing for comparisons among other companies who define FFO as we do. 
  FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairments of real estate assets, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, for both continuing and discontinued operations. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO, or similarly titled measures, used by other companies, and this may not be comparable to those presentations.  
  FFO does not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations, or other commitments and uncertainties, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Our presentation of FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of financial performance.

(1)   
    Reflects 51% of depreciation and amortization for the Market Square Joint Venture, in which we own a 51% interest. 
     Net Operating Income 
  As set forth below, NOI is calculated by deducting property operating costs from rental and other property revenues for continuing operations. As a performance metric consisting of only revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, which have been or will be settled in cash, NOI is narrower in scope than FFO.  
  NOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that NOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties.  
  The major factors influencing our NOI are property acquisitions and dispositions, occupancy levels, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.

     Table of Contents  

Same Store Net Operating Income 
  We also evaluate the performance of our properties, on a "same store" basis, using a metric referred to as Same Store NOI. We view Same Store NOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio. On an individual property basis, Same Store NOI is computed in a consistent manner as NOI. For the periods presented, we have defined our same store portfolio as those properties that have been continuously owned and operating since   July 1, 2015  . NOI and Same Store NOI are calculated as follows for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):  

(1)   
    Reflects NOI from properties that were wholly-owned for the entirety of the periods presented. 
               (2)   
    Same store NOI declined for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in prior year, primarily due to leasing activity at 222 East 41st Street. In the second quarter of 2016, we terminated Jones Day s lease, the majority tenant at 222 East 41st Street, and executed a new lease with NYU Langone Medical for the entire property. As a result, we earned a lease termination fee of $6.2 million from Jones Day in the second quarter in lieu of the rent due for third quarter of 2016. The NYU lease commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
               (3)   
    Reflects NOI from 51% of the Market Square Buildings for all periods presented. On October 28, 2015, we transferred the Market Square Buildings and the $325.0 million mortgage note to a joint venture, and sold a 49% interest in the joint venture. Our interest in NOI from the Market Square Buildings is included in loss from unconsolidated joint venture for the third quarter of 2016, and in our consolidated results of operations for the third quarter of 2015.

  Election as a REIT 
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2003. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income, as defined in the Code, to our stockholders, computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding our net capital gain. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income for that year and for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
  The TRS Entities are wholly owned subsidiaries of Columbia Property Trust, are organized as Delaware limited liability companies, and operate, among other things, office properties that we do not intend to hold long term and a full-service hotel. We have elected to treat the TRS Entities as taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may perform certain additional, noncustomary services for tenants of our buildings through the TRS Entities; however, any earnings related to such services are subject to federal and state income taxes. In addition, for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must limit our investments in taxable REIT subsidiaries to 25% of the value of our total assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. 
  No provisions for federal income taxes have been made in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, other than the provisions relating to the TRS Entities, as we made distributions in excess of taxable income for the periods presented. We are  
  
   Page 44 

subject to certain state and local taxes related to property operations in certain locations, which have been provided for in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Inflation 
  We are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that are intended to protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include rent steps, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the leases may not reset frequently enough to fully cover inflation. 
   
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
  There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Related-Party Transactions  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not have any related party transactions, except as described in Note 4,   Unconsolidated Joint Venture  , of the accompanying financial statements. 
   
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  We are subject to certain commitments and contingencies with regard to certain transactions. Refer to Note 7,   Commitments and Contingencies,   of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further explanation. Examples of such commitments and contingencies include: 
             
    structural repairs at one of our properties with estimated costs, net of recoveries, ranging from $15.0 million to $20.0 million; 
                
    guaranty of debt of an unconsolidated joint venture of $23.3 million; 
                
    obligations under operating leases; 
                
    obligations under capital leases; 
                
    commitments under existing lease agreements, including a commitment for   $70.1 million   in leasehold improvements related to a recently executed lease, which is expected to be paid during 2016 and 2017; and 
                
    litigation. 
      
  Subsequent Event 
  We have evaluated subsequent events in connection with the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report and noted the following item in addition to those disclosed elsewhere in this report: 
  Property Disposition 
  During October 2016, we closed on the sale of the 9127 South Jamaica Street building in Denver, Colorado, as described in Note 3,   Real Estate Transactions  , of the accompanying financial statements. 
   
           ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     As a result of certain of our debt facilities, we are exposed to interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow, primarily through a low to moderate level of overall borrowings. However, we currently have a substantial amount of debt outstanding. We manage our ratio of fixed- to floating-rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that we believe is appropriate in light of anticipated changes. We closely monitor interest rates and will continue to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities to determine whether we have appropriately guarded ourselves against the risk of increasing interest rates in future periods. 
  Additionally, we have entered into interest rate swaps, and may enter into other interest rate swaps, caps, or other arrangements to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not currently enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes; however, certain of our derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All of our debt was entered into for other-than-trading purposes.  
  
   Page 45 

     Table of Contents  

Our financial instruments consist of both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Our variable-rate borrowings consist of the Revolving Credit Facility, the $300 Million Term Loan, and the $150 Million Term Loan. However, only the Revolving Credit Facility and the $300 Million Term Loan bear interest at effectively variable rates, as the variable rate on the $150 Million Term Loan has been effectively fixed through the interest rate swap agreement described in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 2,   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $99.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was fully repaid on October 3, 2016, using a portion of the proceeds from the September 30, 2016 sale of the 80 Park Plaza building; $150.0 million outstanding on the $150 Million Term Loan; $300.0 million outstanding on the $300 Million Term Loan; $349.6 million in 2025 Bonds Payable outstanding; $348.7 million in 2026 Bonds Payable outstanding; and $276.0     million outstanding on fixed-rate, term mortgage loans. The weighted-average interest rate of all of our debt instruments was 3.42% as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Approximately $1,124.3 million of our total debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , is subject to fixed rates, either directly or when coupled with an interest rate swap agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , these balances incurred interest expense at an average interest rate of 3.94% and have expirations ranging from 2017 through 2026. The amounts outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility in the future will largely depend upon future acquisition and disposition activity. 
  Our unconsolidated Market Square Joint Venture holds a $325 million mortgage note, which bears interest at 5.07%. Adjusting for 51% of the debt at the Market Square Joint Venture, in which we own a 51% interest, our weighted-average interest rate is 3.58%. 
  We do not believe there is any exposure to increases in interest rates related to the capital lease obligations of $120.0 million at   September 30, 2016  , as the obligations are at fixed interest rates. 
   
           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Management's Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods in SEC rules and forms, including providing a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
