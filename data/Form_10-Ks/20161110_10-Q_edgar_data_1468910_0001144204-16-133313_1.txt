NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements, in the opinion
of management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of Millburn
Multi-Markets Fund L.P. s (the  Partnership ) financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 (unaudited) and the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited). 

These financial statements present the results of interim periods
and do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements. It is suggested that these financial statements
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes included in the Partnership s 2015 annual report included
in Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The December 31, 2015 information has been derived from the audited
financial statements as of December 31, 2015. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted ( U.S. GAAP ) in the United States of America (the  U.S. ), as detailed in
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ), requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. 

The Partnership enters into contracts with various financial
institutions that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Partnership s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown.
However, the Partnership has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

The Income Taxes topic of the Codification clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in tax positions. This requires that the Partnership recognize in its financial statements the impact of any uncertain
tax positions. Based on a review of the Partnership s open tax years, 2012 to 2015, Millburn Ridgefield Corporation (the
 General Partner ) has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions were required. 

There have been no material changes with respect to the Partnership s
critical accounting policies, off-balance sheet arrangements or disclosure of contractual obligations as reported in the Partnership's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015. 

2. INVESTMENT IN MILLBURN MULTI-MARKETS TRADING L.P. 

The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets in Millburn
Multi-Markets Trading L.P. (the  Master Fund ). The Partnership s ownership percentage of the Master Fund at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 73.97% and 72.71%, respectively, of total partners  capital of the Master Fund. See
the attached financial statements of the Master Fund. 

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Partnership bears its own expenses, including, but not limited
to, periodic legal, accounting and filing fees. Total operating expenses related to investors in the Partnership (including their
pro-rata share of Master Fund expenses) are not expected to exceed 1/2 of 1% per annum of the Partnership s average month-end
partners  capital. 

During any time in which a third-party administrator is providing
services to the Master Fund, as is currently the case, the General Partner is paid a monthly Administration Fee for administration
services it provides calculated as a percentage of the month-end net asset value (prior to reduction for withdrawals or redemptions,
management fees, amounts payable to selling agents and the administration fee then being calculated) of the Master Fund equal to
0.05% per annum of the Master Fund s average net assets. The Partnership is allocated its pro-rata portion of the Administration
Fee which is charged at the Master Fund level. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $60,470 and $51,447, respectively,
were payable by the Master Fund to the General Partner and are included in  accrued expenses  in the Master Fund s
Statements of Financial Condition. 

Series A Limited Partners that redeem Units at or prior to the
end of the first eleven months after such Units are sold shall be assessed redemption charges calculated based on their redeemed
Units' net asset value as of the date of redemption. All redemption charges will be paid to the General Partner. At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no redemption charges owed to the General Partner. 

4. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 

Per Unit operating performance for Series A, Series B and Series
C Units is calculated based on Limited Partners  Partnership capital for each series taken as a whole utilizing the beginning
and ending net asset value per unit and weighted average number of units during the period. Weighted average number of units of
each series is detailed below.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

The Master Fund engages in the speculative trading of futures
and forward currency contracts and also acts as a master fund for the Partnership and Millburn Multi-Markets Ltd., a Cayman Islands
exempted company (the  Cayman Feeder ). 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements, in the opinion
of management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the
Master Fund s financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (unaudited) and the results of its operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited). 

These financial statements present the results of interim periods
and do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements. It is suggested that these financial statements
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes included in the Master Fund s annual report for the
year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Partnership s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The December 31, 2015 information has been derived from the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted ( U.S. GAAP ) in the United States of America (the  U.S. ), as detailed in
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ), requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. 

The Master Fund enters into contracts with various financial
institutions that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Master Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown.
However, the Master Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

The Income Taxes topic of the Codification clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in tax positions. This requires that the Partnership recognize in its financial statements the impact of any uncertain
tax positions. Based on a review of the Partnership s open tax years, 2012 to 2015, the General Partner has determined
that no reserves for uncertain tax positions were required. 

2. INVESTORS IN MILLBURN MULTI-MARKETS TRADING L.P. 

The Partnership and the Cayman Feeder invest substantially all
of their assets in the Master Fund. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the respective ownership percentages of the Master
Fund are detailed below. The remaining interests are held by direct investors in the Master Fund.  

The capital withdrawals payable at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 were $753,019 and $1,551,666, respectively, as detailed below. 

(1) Includes General Partner s profit share of $142,581
at December 31, 2015. 

The Master Fund bears expenses, including, but not limited to,
periodic legal, accounting and filing fees, up to an amount equal to 1/4 of 1% per annum of average net assets of the Master Fund
(the  Expense Cap ). Amounts subject to the Expense Cap include expenses incurred at the Master Fund and Cayman Feeder
level and the Administration Fee due to the General Partner, as general partner of the Master Fund. The General Partner bears
any excess over such amounts. 

3. FAIR VALUE 

The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Codification
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are
accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial
instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3: Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both
significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

In determining fair value, the Master Fund separates its investments
into two categories: cash instruments and derivative contracts. 

Cash Instruments. The Master Fund s cash instruments are
generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are typically valued using quoted market prices. The
types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include U.S. government obligations. The General Partner
does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments, even in situations where the Master Fund holds a large position and a sale
could reasonably impact the quoted price. 

Derivative Contracts. Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded
or over-the-counter ( OTC ). Exchange-traded futures contracts are valued based on quoted closing settlement prices
and typically fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Spot currency contracts are valued based on current market prices
( Spot Price ). Forward currency contracts are valued based on pricing models that consider the Spot Price plus the
financing cost or benefit ( Forward Point ). Forward Points from the quotation service providers are generally in periods
of one month, two months, three months, six months, nine months and twelve months forward while the contractual forward delivery
dates for the forward currency contracts traded by the Master Fund may be in between these periods. The General Partner s
policy to determine fair value for forward currency contracts involves first calculating the number of months from the date the
forward currency contract is being valued to its maturity date ( Months to Maturity ), then identifying the forward
currency contracts for the two forward months that are closest to the Months to Maturity ( Forward Month Contracts ).
Linear interpolation is then performed between the dates of these two Forward Month Contracts to calculate the interpolated Forward
Point. Model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments
are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Investment Company Status: The Partnership adopted Accounting
Standard Update ( ASU ) 2013-08,  Financial Services   Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to
the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements  and based on the General Partner s assessment, the Partnership
has been deemed to be an investment company since inception. Accordingly, the Partnership follows the investment company accounting
and reporting guidance of Topic 946 and reflects its investments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from
changes in fair value reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2. The following tables represent the Master Fund s
investments by hierarchical level as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in valuing the Master Fund s investments
at fair value. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Master Fund had no assets or liabilities in Level 3. 

Financial assets and liabilities at fair value as of September 30, 2016  

Financial assets and liabilities at fair value as of December
31, 2015  

4. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 

The Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification requires
qualitative disclosure about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts
of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. 

The Master Fund s market risk is influenced by a wide variety
of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial
instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Master Fund s open positions and the liquidity of the markets
in which it trades. 

The Master Fund engages in the speculative trading of futures and
forward contracts on interest rates, grains, softs, currencies, metals, energies, livestock and stock indices. The following were
the primary trading risk exposures of the Master Fund at September 30, 2016 by market sector: 

Agricultural (grains, livestock and softs)   The
Master Fund s primary exposure is to agricultural price movements, which are often directly affected by severe or unexpected
weather conditions, as well as supply and demand factors. 

Currencies   Exchange rate risk is a principal
market exposure of the Master Fund. The Master Fund s currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations
which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. The fluctuations are influenced
by interest rate changes, as well as political and general economic conditions. The Master Fund trades in a large number of currencies,
including cross-rates e.g., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 

Energies   The Master Fund s primary energy
market exposure is to gas and oil price movements often resulting from political developments in the oil producing countries and
economic conditions worldwide. Energy prices are volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue
to be experienced in this sector. 

Interest rates   Interest rate movements directly
affect the price of the sovereign bond futures positions held by the Master Fund and indirectly the value of its stock index and
currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country, as well as relative interest rate movements between countries may
materially impact the Master Fund s profitability. The Master Fund s primary interest rate exposure is to interest
rate fluctuations in countries or regions including Australia, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and the
Eurozone. However, the Master Fund also may take positions in futures contracts on the government debt of other nations. The General
Partner anticipates that interest rates in these industrialized countries or areas, both long-term and short-term, will remain
the primary interest rate market exposure of the Master Fund for the foreseeable future. 

Metals   The Master Fund s metals market
exposure is to fluctuations in the price of aluminum, copper, gold, lead, nickel, platinum, silver, tin and zinc. 

Stock indices   The Master Fund s equity
exposure, through stock index futures, is to equity price risk in the major industrialized countries, as well as other countries. 

The Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification requires
entities to recognize in the Statements of Financial Condition all derivative contracts as assets or liabilities. Fair values
of futures and forward currency contracts in an asset position by counterparty are recorded in the Statements of Financial Condition
as  Net unrealized appreciation on open futures and forward currency contracts.  Fair values of futures and forward
currency contracts in a liability position by counterparty are recorded in the Statements of Financial Condition as  Net
unrealized depreciation on open futures and forward currency contracts.  The Master Fund s policy regarding fair value
measurement is discussed in the Fair Value and Disclosures note, contained herein. 

Since the derivatives held or sold by the Master Fund are for speculative
trading purposes, the derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of the Derivatives
and Hedging guidance. Accordingly, all realized gains and losses, as well as any change in net unrealized gains or losses on open
positions from the preceding period, are recognized as part of the Master Fund s trading gains and losses in the Statements
of Operations. 

The following tables present the fair value of open futures and
forward currency contracts, held long or sold short, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Fair value is presented on a
gross basis even though the contracts are subject to master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Master
Fund s Statements of Financial Condition.

The customer agreements between the Master Fund, the futures clearing
brokers including Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG), and SG Americas Securities,
LLC as well as the FX prime broker, Deutsche Bank AG, and the swap dealer, Morgan Stanley   Co., LLC, give the Master
Fund the legal right to net unrealized gains and losses on open futures and foreign currency contracts. The Master Fund netted,
for financial reporting purposes, the unrealized gains and losses on open futures and forward currency contracts on the Statements
of Financial Condition as the criteria under ASC 210-20,  Balance Sheet,  were met. The Master Fund ceased clearing
trades through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC during September 2015.

  (4)  Net amount represents the amounts owed by the Partnership

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the
failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk is normally reduced to the extent that
an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to futures transactions since typically the collective credit of the
members of the exchange is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange. 

The General Partner seeks to minimize credit risk primarily by
depositing and maintaining the Master Fund s assets at financial institutions and trading counterparties which the General
Partner believes to be creditworthy. In addition, for OTC forward currency contracts, the Master Fund enters into master netting
agreements with its counterparties. Collateral posted at the various counterparties for trading of futures and forward currency
contracts includes cash and U.S. Treasury notes. 

The Master Fund s forward currency trading activities are
cleared through Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) and Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS ). The Master Fund s
concentration of credit risk associated with DB or MS nonperformance includes unrealized gains inherent in such contracts, which
are recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition plus the value of margin or collateral held by DB, and MS. The
amount of such credit risk was $8,022,162 and $18,848,878 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Partners  capital taken as a whole. The computation of such ratios based on the amount of expenses and profit share allocation
assessed to an individual partner s capital account may vary from these ratios based on the timing of capital transactions
and differences in individual partners  management fee, selling commission, platform fee and profit share allocation arrangements.
Returns are calculated based on 1) a Limited Partner that is charged a monthly management fee of 1/12 of 2.00% (2.00% per annum)

vary from these returns based on the timing of capital transactions and differences in individual partners  management fee,
selling commission, platform fee and profit share allocation arrangements. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Reference is made to Item 1,  Financial Statements. 
The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in connection with, the following analysis. 

OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW 

The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets in the
Master Fund. Due to the nature of the Master Fund's business, its results of operations depend on the General Partner's ability
to recognize and capitalize on trends and other profit opportunities in different sectors of the global capital and commodity
markets. The General Partner's investment and trading methods are confidential so that substantially the only information that
can be furnished regarding the Master Fund's results of operations is contained in the performance record of its trading. Unlike
operating businesses, general economic or seasonal conditions do not directly affect the profit potential of the Master Fund,
and its past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The General Partner believes, however, that there are
certain market conditions, for example, markets with strong price trends, in which the Master Fund has a better likelihood of
being profitable than in others. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Units may be offered for sale as of the beginning, and may be redeemed
as of the end, of each month. 

The amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have
a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership and the Master Fund have no significant capital expenditure or working
capital requirements other than for monies to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and charges. Within broad ranges of capitalization,
the General Partner s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Master
Fund (in which the Partnership participates). 

The Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale
of Units and capital is increased through trading profits (if any). Neither the Partnership nor the Master Fund engages in borrowing. 

The Master Fund trades futures, forwards, and spot contracts on
interest rate instruments, agricultural commodities, currencies, metals, energy and stock indices, and forward contracts on currencies,
and may trade options on the foregoing and swaps thereon. Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts (market risk)
and the potential inability of counterparties or brokers to perform under the terms of their contracts (credit risk). Market risk
is generally measured by the face amount of the futures positions acquired and the volatility of the markets traded. The credit
risk from counterparty non-performance associated with these instruments is the net unrealized gain, if any, on these positions
plus the value of the margin or collateral held by the counterparty. The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally
perceived to be less than those associated with OTC transactions because exchanges typically (but not universally) provide clearinghouse
arrangements in which the collective credit (in some cases limited in amount, in some cases not) of the members of the exchange
is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange. In most OTC transactions, on the other hand, traders must rely
(typically but not universally) solely on the credit of their respective individual counterparties. Margins which may be subject
to loss in the event of a default are generally required in exchange trading and counterparties may require margin or collateral
in the OTC markets. 

The General Partner has procedures in place to control market risk,
although there can be no assurance that they will, in fact, succeed in doing so. These procedures primarily focus on (1) real
time monitoring of open positions; (2) diversifying positions among various markets; (3) limiting the assets committed as margin
or collateral, generally within a range of 5% to 35% of an account s net assets, though the amount may at any time be substantially
higher; and (4) prohibiting pyramiding (that is, using unrealized profits in a particular market as margin for additional positions
in the same market). The General Partner attempts to control credit risk by causing the Partnership to deal exclusively with
large, well-capitalized financial institutions as brokers and counterparties. 

The financial instruments traded by the Master Fund contain varying
degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market values of the futures, forwards, and spot contracts or the Master
Fund s satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition of the
Master Fund. 

Due to the nature of the Master Fund s business, substantially
all its assets are represented by cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. government obligations, while the Master Fund maintains its
market exposure through open futures, forwards, and spot contract positions. 

The Master Fund s futures contracts are settled by offset
and are cleared by the exchange clearinghouse function. Open futures positions are marked-to-market each trading day and the Master
Fund s trading accounts are debited or credited accordingly. Options on futures contracts are settled either by offset or
by exercise. If an option on a future is exercised, the Master Fund is assigned a position in the underlying future which is then
settled by offset. The Master Fund s spot and forward currency transactions conducted in the interbank market are settled
by netting offsetting positions or payment obligations and by cash payments. 

The value of the Master Fund s cash and financial instruments
is not materially affected by inflation. Changes in interest rates, which are often associated with inflation, could cause the
value of certain of the Master Fund s debt securities to decline, but only to a limited extent. More importantly, changes
in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down market price trends, during which the Master Fund s profit potential
generally increases. However, inflation can also give rise to markets which have numerous short price trends followed by rapid
reversals, markets in which the Master Fund is likely to suffer losses. 

The Master Fund s assets are generally held as cash or cash
equivalents, including U.S. government securities or securities issued by federal agencies, other Commodity Futures Trading Commission-authorized
investments or bank held or certain other money market instruments (e.g., bankers acceptances and Eurodollar or other time deposits),
which are used to margin the Master Fund s futures, forwards, and spot currency positions and withdrawn, as necessary, to
pay redemptions and expenses. Other than potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, due, for example, to limited open
interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Master Fund s futures,
forward and spot trading, the Master Fund s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so. During its operations
through September 30, 2016, the Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity
in any of the numerous markets traded by the General Partner. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Master Fund records its transactions in futures, forward and
spot contracts, including related income and expenses, on a trade date basis. Open futures contracts traded on an exchange are
valued at fair value, which is based on the closing settlement price on the exchange where the futures contract is traded by the
Master Fund on the day with respect to which net assets are being determined. Spot currency contracts are valued based on current
market prices ( Spot Price ). Forward currency contracts are valued based on pricing models that consider the Spot
Price plus the financing cost or benefit ( Forward Point ). Forward Points from the quotation service providers are
generally in periods of one month, two months, three months, six months, nine months and twelve months forward while the contractual
forward delivery dates for the forward currency contracts traded by the Master Fund may be in between these periods. The General
Partner s policy to determine fair value for forward currency contracts involves first calculating the number of months
from the date the forward currency contract is being valued to its maturity date ( Months to Maturity ), then identifying
the forward currency contracts for the two forward months that are closest to the Months to Maturity ( Forward Month Contracts ).
Linear interpolation is then performed between the dates of these two Forward Month Contracts to calculate the interpolated Forward
Point. Model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments
are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as accrual of expenses, that affect the amounts and disclosures
reported in the financial statements. Based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, the General Partner
believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership s financial statements are appropriate and reasonable,
however actual results could differ from these estimates. The estimates used do not provide a range of possible results that would
require the exercise of subjective judgment. The General Partner further believes that, based on the nature of the business and
operations of the Partnership, no other reasonable assumptions relating to the application of the Partnership s critical
accounting estimates other than those currently used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Due to the nature of the Partnership s trading, through its
investment in the Master Fund, the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be considered indicative
of the results that may be expected for the entire year. 

Periods ended September 30, 2016 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

The increase in the Partnership s net assets of $18,324,086
was attributable to net income after profit share of $1,080,429, and contributions of $19,747,384 which were partially offset
by withdrawals of $2,503,727. 

Management fees, through the Partnership s investment in
the Master Fund, are calculated on the net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance,
contributions and redemptions. Management fees, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 increased $195,576 relative to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was due to an increase
in the average net asset value of the Partnership during the three months ended September 30, 2016, relative to the corresponding
period in 2015. 

The Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, bears
all trade-related commission and clearing charges due to third-party brokers. Brokerage commissions, through the Partnership s
investment in the Master Fund, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $19,210 relative to the corresponding period
in 2015. The increase was due to an increase in average net assets of the Partnership during the three months ended September
30, 2016, relative to the corresponding period in 2015. 

Selling commissions and platform fees are calculated on the net
asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance, contributions and redemptions. Selling commissions
and platform fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $175,779 relative to the corresponding period in 2015.
The increase was due to an increase in the average net asset value of commission paying investors of the Partnership during the
three months ended September 30, 2016, relative to the corresponding period in 2015. 

The Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, pays
administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services. Administrative expenses, net of amounts borne by the General
Partner, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased
$49,449 relative to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was due mainly to an increase in the Partnership s average
net asset value during the three months ended September 30, 2016, relative to the corresponding period in 2015. 

Interest income, through the Partnership s investment in
the Master Fund, is derived from cash and U.S. Treasury instruments held at the Master Fund s brokers and custodian. Interest
income, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased
$94,580 relative to the corresponding period in 2015. This increase was due predominantly to an increase in short-term U.S. Treasury
yields during the three months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the corresponding period in 2015, and partially due to an
increase in average net assets over the same period. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership,
through its investment in the Master Fund, experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $2,987,619 from trading operations
(including foreign exchange transactions and translations). Management fees of $796,810, brokerage commissions of $90,460, selling
commissions and platform fees of $723,400, administrative and operating expenses of $203,842, custody fees and other expenses
of $6,867, and profit share of $254,063 were paid or accrued. Interest income of $168,252 partially offset the Master Fund expenses
allocated to the Partnership resulting in net income after profit share of $1,080,429. 

An analysis of the Master Fund s trading gain (loss)
by sector is as follows: 

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

The increase in the Partnership s net assets of $38,425,335
was attributable to net income after profit share through its investment in the Master Fund of $17,689,736 and contributions of
$29,547,384 which were partially offset by withdrawals of $8,811,785. 

Management fees, through the Partnership s investment in
the Master Fund, are calculated on the net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance,
contributions and redemptions. Management fees, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 increased $305,048 relative to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was due to an increase
in the average net asset value of the Partnership during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, relative to the corresponding
period in 2015. 

The Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, bears
all trade-related commission and clearing charges due to third-party brokers. Brokerage commissions, through the Partnership s
investment in the Master Fund, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $44,649 relative to the corresponding period
in 2015. The increase was due an increase in average net assets of the Partnership during the nine months ended September 30,
2016, relative to the corresponding period in 2015. 

Selling commissions and platform fees are calculated on the net
asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance, contributions and redemptions. Selling commissions
and platform fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $267,615 relative to the corresponding period in 2015.
The increase was due to an increase in the average net asset value of commission paying investors of the Partnership during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, relative to the corresponding period in 2015. 

The Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, pays
administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services. Administrative expenses, net of amounts borne by the General
Partner, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
$77,314 relative to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was due mainly to an increase in the Partnership s average
net asset value during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, relative to the corresponding period in 2015. 

Interest income, through the Partnership s investment in
the Master Fund, is derived from cash and U.S. Treasury instruments held at the Master Fund s brokers and custodian. Interest
income, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
$218,000 relative to the corresponding period in 2015. This increase was due predominantly to an increase in short-term U.S. Treasury
yields during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the corresponding period in 2015, and partially due to an increase
in average net assets over the same period. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership,
through its investment in the Master Fund, achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $25,934,754 from trading operations (including
foreign exchange transactions and translations). Management fees of $2,114,538, brokerage commissions of $267,872, selling commissions
and platform fees of $1,919,462, administrative and operating expenses of $541,800, custody fees and other expenses of $18,562,
and profit share of $3,763,011 were paid or accrued. Interest income of $380,227 partially offset the Master Fund expenses allocated
to the Partnership resulting in net income after profit share of $17,689,736. 

An analysis of the Master Fund s trading gain (loss)
by sector is as follows: 

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION   2016 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 

The Partnership was profitable during the third quarter largely
due to gains from long equity and long interest futures positions. Trading of currency forwards and grain and livestock futures
were each profitable. On the other hand, trading of energy, metal and soft commodity futures were unprofitable. 

Markets were unsettled throughout the period by a number of factors
including: the repercussions of the U.K. voters  decision to have the U.K. leave the European Union, the continued market
schizophrenia about an interest rate increase by the Fed, the persistent discussions within OPEC about a potential production
cut, and concerns about the upcoming U.S. elections. Moreover, as interest rates, the U.S. dollar, and energy prices reacted to
these influences, there were secondary repercussions of those prices in other markets. 

Long positions in German, French, Italian, British, Japanese and
Canadian note and bond futures were profitable as sluggish growth and inflation kept the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan
on accommodative policy paths. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve continued to waffle on if and when it will raise interest rates,
even though U.S. growth and inflation data showed improvement in the third quarter. As a result, long positions in U.S. note,
bond and short-term interest rate futures posted losses, especially in August and early September when U.S. interest rates rose
in anticipation of a near term Fed rate hike. After the Fed failed to deliver that increase at its September meeting, those U.S.
losses were reduced somewhat. 

Though the path was uneven, improving U.S. economic data, continued
developed-world accommodative monetary policy, and higher energy prices that underpinned commodity producers led to profits on
long positions in U.S., Canadian and Australian equity futures. A weaker pound sterling and policy accommodation from the Bank
of England produced a gain for a long U.K. stock futures trade. Long Hong Kong and Taiwanese futures positions were profitable,
as well. Meanwhile, short Japanese equity futures positions were unprofitable. 

Foreign exchange trading was volatile and results were mixed. A
short Mexican peso trade was profitable as U.S. political problems and somewhat slower growth combined with the trade and immigration
concerns raised by the U.S. Presidential campaign of Donald Trump to undermine the peso. Rising energy and commodity prices and
the lack of a Fed rate hike led to profits on long positions in high yield and commodity currencies including the: New Zealand
and Australian dollars, Russian ruble, South African rand, Indian rupee, and Israeli shekel, especially in September. A short
sterling trade was also profitable, as were short euro trades versus the Norwegian and Polish currencies. Short dollar trades
against the euro, yen, Canadian dollar, and several other units produced largely offsetting losses. 

With corn inventories at 30-year highs and with worldwide grain
production expected to increase 10% this year, short corn and wheat positions were profitable, particularly in July and August.
Trading the soybean complex beans, meal and oil generated a partially offsetting loss. Short cattle and hog positions
were profitable. Long cotton and sugar positions, and trading of crude palm oil were marginally unprofitable. 

Energy prices were volatile with Brent and WTI crude vacillating
in the $40-$50 range. Record levels of production, high inventories, a glut of refined products in July, and bouts of dollar strength
periodically depressed prices. On the other hand, persistent talk of production control agreements within OPEC and between OPEC
and non-OPEC producers, and periods of dollar weakness underpinned prices at times. As a result, long energy trades were unprofitable
in July and September, and short energy trades were unprofitable, especially in August. 

Metal prices also experienced volatility during the July-September
period. Losses from a short copper position and from trading gold, platinum, lead and nickel were marginally larger than the gains
from trading silver and from a long zinc position. 

Three months ended June 30, 2016 

The Partnership was profitable during the second quarter with gains
from long interest rate futures positions again leading the way. Trading of equity futures and foreign exchange forwards added
fractionally to the gain. Meanwhile, trading of commodity futures was also slightly profitable as the gain from trading grain
futures outdistanced the losses from the energy and metals sectors. 

Long positions in U.S., German, French, British, Canadian and Australian
interest rate futures were profitable, particularly after the U.K. voters  surprise vote to have the U.K. leave the European
Union (the  EU ) produced a flight to safety and an expectation that easier monetary policy would be forthcoming rather
broadly going forward. The weak June employment report in the U.S. that prompted another delay in the Federal Reserve ( Fed )
rate rise program had underpinned the prices of note, bond and short term interest rate futures earlier. The fact that growth
and inflation have failed to accelerate convincingly, and that the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development among others have lowered their global growth projections also supported fixed income prices. 

Currency trading was particularly volatile as the dollar was buffeted
to and fro during the quarter. The U.S. currency would strengthen whenever Fed Governors hinted that a rate increase was possible,
such as in late April-early May and in late May-early June, but fall when those expectations faded. For example, after an extraordinarily
weak U.S. June jobs report, such hopes were put on hold and the dollar weakened. Then, when Fed Chair Janet Yellen cited real
concerns that the  temporary headwinds  that had blunted the Fed s rate rise program might actually reflect
Lawrence Summers   secular stagnation  rather than just passing concerns, the U.S. dollar softened further.
However, following the surprise decision of the British electorate to leave the EU, a flight to safety and quality prompted an
upward U-turn for the dollar. Overall, long U.S. dollar trades against the pound sterling and Swiss franc, and short dollar trades
relative to the Brazilian real, New Zealand dollar and South African rand were profitable. On the other hand, short U.S. dollar
trades versus the Australian, Israeli, Mexican, Polish and Swedish currencies produced losses. Trading the euro against the dollar,
Polish zloty and Turkish lira was also unprofitable. 

Trading of equity futures was fractionally profitable after a volatile
quarter. Following a strong rebound from the February lows, equity trading was unsettled periodically by currency turmoil, the
uncertainty surrounding Bank of Japan, the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, worries about future growth
and inflation outlooks, and actualized weakness in corporate profits. Still, gains on long positions in non-tech U.S., Canadian
and British stock futures and from a short VIX trade outpaced the losses from trading of a number of European and Asian indices. 

Long positions in soybeans and soybean meal were profitable as
bad weather in Brazil and Argentina underpinned prices for most of the period. A long sugar position posted a gain when prices
rose as production in Thailand, India and Brazil was hurt by El Ni o weather influences. 

A short natural gas trade registered a loss as warmer than normal
weather boosted prices, especially in June. Trading of London gas oil, heating oil, RBOB gasoline and WTI crude were also unprofitable,
while a long position in Brent crude produced a partially offsetting gain. 

Short positions in gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, aluminum,
lead and nickel were each slightly unprofitable. On the other hand, a long zinc trade was profitable near the end of the quarter. 

Three months ended March 31, 2016 

During a quarter of extreme market volatility, the Partnership
registered a strong performance led by gains on long interest rate futures positions. Trading of equity futures and foreign exchange
forwards were also profitable. Meanwhile, commodity futures were marginally negative as a gain from trading energy futures was
outweighed by fractional losses from trading metal and agricultural futures. 

Concerns about global growth that International Monetary Fund Managing
Director Christine Lagarde described as   too low, too fragile and facing increased risks to its durability  ,
combined with doubts about policy makers  competence and capabilities, generated strong demand for government securities
for most of the quarter. The demand for this debt was underpinned when: the Bank of Japan moved official interest rates into negative
territory at the end of January; the Bank of England delayed any potential rate increase; the European Central Bank (the  ECB )
and People s Bank of China (the  PBOC ) eased monetary policy in March; and a speech by Federal Reserve ( Fed )
Chair Janet Yellen squashed expectations for a near term Fed rate increase. Consequently, long positions in U.S., German, French,
Italian, British, Japanese, Australian and Canadian notes and bonds were profitable. Long positions in short-term dollar and sterling
interest rate futures were also profitable. 

Equity markets were particularly volatile during the first quarter
of 2016, tracing out a classic V-shaped path. The tumultuous first half of the period saw many equity indices experiencing multiyear
lows before rebounding impressively over the second half of the quarter. Early on, weak economic data out of China and concerns
about official policy decisions generated a renewed rout in Chinese equities and the yuan. These events, combined with a further
collapse in energy prices; worries that Fed interest rate increases and a stronger dollar might impede global growth; and a halt
in corporate profit growth, produced a broad, sharp equity selloff. Later, equity prices recovered as energy prices rebounded,
the ECB, PBOC and Fed displayed easier policy tendencies, the U.S. dollar eased and growth concerns moderated. On balance, short
positions in Chinese, Hong Kong, Japanese, Singaporean, Indian, and Spanish futures were profitable. Trading of U.S. and Canadian
stock index futures also posted gains. On the other hand, short positions in Dutch and South African futures, a long U.K stock
futures position, and trading of the European stoxx future resulted in somewhat offsetting losses. 

Foreign exchange trading was also volatile. At the beginning of
the year, given the search for safety, declining oil prices and the Fed  relatively hawkish  policy position, the
U.S. dollar strengthened. Thus, during January and February, long dollar trades versus the pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Korean
won, Russian Ruble and Mexican peso were profitable. The pound fell precipitously when the possibility of Britain s exit
from the EU became more likely and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, endorsed the move. As the quarter unfolded, however, the
PBOC aggressively implemented measures to support the yuan; the G-20 Shanghai Communique in late February signaled a strong stance
against currency competition that took some steam out of the dollar; and the likelihood of a near term increase in interest rates
by the Fed diminished, prompting a U.S. dollar decline, especially against emerging market currencies where interest rates tend
to be higher. A stabilization of commodity prices also helped the commodity producing countries. A series of events abroad further
encouraged the U.S. dollar slippage: Mexico s surprise February 50 basis point hike in official interest rates; the increasing
likelihood of an ouster of President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil; an increase in official rates in South Africa; and rising oil prices
and high interest rates supporting the Russian ruble. Consequently, short dollar positions against the currencies of Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Columbia, India, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey were profitable. On the other hand,
long dollar trades versus the euro, yen, Swiss franc, Swedish krona, Norwegian kroner, Czech koruna, Polish zloty and Chilean
peso were unprofitable. 

With the International Energy Agency suggesting that the   world
could drown in [oil] oversupply   with crude oil production at or near recent record levels in many countries e.g.,
Saudi Arabia, Russia, the U.S., and Iraq; with Iranian exports ramping up; and with global demand still sluggish, crude prices
slumped below $30 per barrel in January. Short positions in Brent crude, WTI crude, RBOB gasoline, London gas oil, heating oil
and natural gas were profitable. Subsequently, reports that Saudi Arabia, Russia and a number of other producers were discussing
plans for a production freeze and would meet in Doha in April sparked an oil price rebound. Indeed, oil prices reached a three
month high above $40 per barrel on March 18. Consequently, losses were suffered on these same short crude oil, crude products
and natural gas trades, and positions were reduced and/or reversed. Overall, energy trading was fractionally profitable for the
quarter due to gains from WTI crude, natural gas, London gas oil and spread trading of crude. 

Industrial metal prices vacillated during the quarter but did move
up somewhat in synchrony with energy prices, and short positions in industrial metals were unprofitable. Safe haven demand pushed
up gold prices, especially in February, and a small long trade was fractionally profitable, providing a partial offset. 

Trading of sugar was unprofitable, as was a long cocoa trade in
January, and a short Arabica coffee position in March. The profits from short corn and wheat trades fractionally outdistanced
the losses from trading soybeans and soybean meal.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

The increase in the Partnership s net assets of $2,878,234
was attributable to net income after profit share of $6,369,010 and contributions of $1,110,226, which were partially offset by
withdrawals of $4,601,002. 

Management fees, through the Partnership s investment in
the Master Fund, are calculated on the net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance,
subscriptions and redemptions. Management fees, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 increased $36,198 relative to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was due to an increase in
the average net asset value of the Partnership during the three months ended September 30, 2015, relative to the corresponding
period in 2014. 

The Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, bears
all trade-related commission and clearing charges due to third-party brokers. Brokerage commissions, through the Partnership s
investment in the Master Fund, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 decreased $42,496 relative to the corresponding period
in 2014. The decrease was due mainly to a decrease in trading volume at the Master Fund, relative to the corresponding period
in 2014. 

Selling commissions and platform fees are calculated on the net
asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Selling commissions
and platform fees for the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased $33,215 relative to the corresponding period in 2014.
The increase was due to an increase in the average net asset value of commission paying investors of the Partnership during the
three months ended September 30, 2015, relative to the corresponding period in 2014. 

The Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, pays
administrative expenses for legal, audit and accounting services. Administrative expenses, net of amounts borne by the General
Partner, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased
$6,222 relative to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase was due mainly to an increase in the Partnership s pro
rata percentage allocation of administrative expenses at the Master Fund during the three months ended September 30, 2015, relative
to the corresponding period in 2014. 

Interest income, through the Partnership s investment in
the Master Fund, is derived from cash and U.S. Treasury instruments held at the Master Fund s brokers and custodian. Interest
income, through the Partnership s investment in the Master Fund, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased
$41,639 relative to the corresponding period in 2014. This increase was due primarily to an increase in U.S. Treasury coupon interest
during the three months ended September 30, 2015 relative to the corresponding period in 2014, and partially due to an increase
in average net assets over the same period. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership,
through its investment in the Master Fund, experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $7,704,757 from its trading operations
(including foreign exchange translations and U.S. Treasury notes). Management fees of $601,234, brokerage commissions of $71,250,
selling commissions and platform fees of $547,621, administrative and operating expenses of $154,393, custody fees and other expenses
of $5,532 and an accrued profit share to the General Partner of $29,389 were incurred. Interest income of $73,672 partially offset
the Master Fund expenses allocated to the Partnership resulting in net income after profit share to the General Partner of $6,369,010.

An analysis of the Master Fund s trading gain (loss)
by sector is as follows: 

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION   2015 

Three months ended September 30, 2015 

At the end of a quarter of extraordinary volatility in both financial
and commodity markets, The Partnership posted a gain due to profits from long interest rate futures positions, short energy and
metal future positions and, long dollar foreign exchange forward positions. On the other hand, trading of stock index futures
was unprofitable, as was, to a lesser extent, trading of agricultural commodity futures. 

Futile attempts by Chinese officials to stem a sharp equity selloff,
two official rate cuts by the People s Bank of China (the  PBOC ), and a surprise devaluation of the Chinese
yuan, coupled with weak economic data, raised questions about how China s leadership was addressing its economic slowdown.
Also during the quarter, the vacillating prospects for a Federal Reserve interest rate increase were answered in a somewhat surprising
way in September when the Federal Reserve failed to raise official rates. The decision not to change rates, even as U.S. growth
and employment data remained strong, led the markets to conclude that U.S. policymakers think the rising U.S. dollar, increased
market volatility and slowing growth in emerging economies could derail global economic activity, and they did not want to exacerbate
that threat with a rate increase. Actual and upcoming elections in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Argentina, Singapore, Canada
and Australia, and heightened political uncertainties elsewhere Brazil, Russia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Middle East only
added to investor skittishness. 

Against this background and with inflation generally subdued globally,
demand for government securities, augmented by some safe haven buying, was strong. Consequently, long positions in U.S., Canadian,
German, French, Italian, British and Japanese note and bond futures were profitable. Long positions in U.S. and British short-term
interest rate futures were profitable also. Official rate reductions by several central banks including those of China (twice),
New Zealand (twice), Canada, Taiwan, Norway, Sweden, India and Hungary added to the downward pressure on interest rates. A September
comment from ECB President Draghi that   more ease is possible   also supported government securities
purchases. 

Lowered global growth projections from the IMF, World Bank, OECD,
WTO and Asian Development Bank cemented the outlook for low energy demand amid continuing oversupply. Consequently, energy prices
declined and short positions in crude oil, crude oil products, and natural gas were profitable. This occurred despite an abrupt though
temporary 25% oil price spike on the final three trading days of August, amid signs that U.S. production during the first half
of 2015 had fallen more than previously reported, and that OPEC might be willing to alter its current production stance. This
was the largest three day gain in the price of oil in 25 years. 

Prices of industrial metals fell in the July-September period.
Short positions in copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc and platinum were profitable. Abundant supplies and inventories of metals brought
on by the expansion of productive capacity over the past 10-20 years have combined with sluggish demand especially from
China  and a stronger U.S. dollar to depress prices. Trading of gold and silver were marginally unprofitable. 

In the wake of the difficult economic and political situations
in Asia and emerging markets, long U.S. dollar positions versus the currencies of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Korea, Canada,
New Zealand, Russia, and Turkey were profitable. On the other hand, as risk was unwound, the euro, which had been used as funding
vehicle due to its low interest rate, advanced faster than the U.S. dollar and a long U.S. dollar position versus the euro was
unprofitable. Trading the U.S. dollar against the currencies of India, Australia, the U.K., Switzerland, the Czech Republic and
Poland was unprofitable. After the Federal Reserve failed to raise interest rates, the U.S. dollar fell back somewhat, earlier
profits were reduced and positions were cut back. Short Australian dollar trades versus a number of other currencies added fractionally
to profits. 

In this environment, investors sold equities aggressively and volatility
spiked higher, especially in August and September. Long positions in Japanese, Hong Kong, Chinese and U.S. equity futures were
unprofitable, and positions were reduced or reversed. Short positions in Korean and Singaporean indices, and trading of Dutch
and German stock futures were profitable, reducing the sector s overall loss. In addition, these overall losses were reduced
somewhat when equity prices rallied on the last day of September quarter. 

Turning to agricultural commodities, trading of corn, wheat, soybeans
and soybean meal; a long cotton position and a short crude palm oil trade; and a short hog position were unprofitable. On the
other hand, long soybean oil, KC wheat, sugar and cocoa positions; and short coffee and cattle trades provided partially offsetting
gains. 

Three months ended June 30, 2015 

The Partnership sustained a loss as a number of profitable, consensus
trades from the first quarter proved unprofitable in second quarter. Long positions in interest rate futures, equity futures,
and U.S. dollar forwards and short euro currency trades were unprofitable. Short energy futures trades were unprofitable as well.
On the other hand, trading of metal futures was profitable, while trading of soft and agricultural commodities was nearly flat. 

The sanguine attitude towards Greece from the first quarter became
a second quarter ebb and flow of meetings, proposals, information and recriminations around the Greek crisis, culminating in the
imposition of capital controls; a week-long bank holiday; and a nationwide referendum that rattled equity, bond and currency markets.
The U.S. economy rebounded from its poor first quarter performance, although inflation and wages did not register explicit improvements.
Consequently, the on-again, off-again prospects for a Federal Reserve rate increase added to market anxiety. Finally, uncertainty
about China s growth prospects were compounded late in the period by the sudden, precipitous collapse in Chinese equity
markets. 

The prices of German, French, and Italian note and bond futures,
which had risen precipitously in the wake of the European Central Bank s quantitative easing program, reversed course abruptly,
driving rates sharply higher as analysts questioned the extraordinarily low levels they had reached particularly as EU economic
data was improving and the Greek situation seemed to defy solution. Consequently, long positions in Continental European note
and bond futures were unprofitable. Though the path was not a straight line partly due to reduced global bond market liquidity,
better U.S. economic news pushed U.S. interest rates higher, producing losses from long positions in U.S. note and bond futures.
Long positions in Japanese bond futures, U.K. bond futures, and short sterling futures also registered losses. Long positions
in U.S. 2-year notes and short term euro-U.S. dollar futures did register small gains. 

The path of equity prices during the quarter was uneven across
time and markets. Equity futures were buffeted in a positive way by improving economic data from the U.S. and Europe, and in a
negative way by the unfolding Greek tragedy; by economic growth concerns and wild swings in equity markets in China that prompted
a Bank of China rate cut; and by worries about the timing of possible federal funds rate increases. In the end, the negative influences
carried the day. Long positions in European, British, Canadian, Australian, Korean and Taiwanese equity futures posted losses,
especially in June. Meanwhile, long positions in Chinese, Hong Kong and Japanese futures remained profitable even after posting
losses in May and June. As volatility spiked in June, the gain from a short VIX position was pared back. 

Currency trading was also volatile during the quarter. In April
and early May, poor results from the U.S. first quarter GDP report raised the likelihood that an anticipated Federal Reserve interest
rate increase would be delayed. Consequently, long U.S. dollar positions registered losses and were reduced or reversed. Later
on, the U.S. dollar steadied as U.S. economic data recovered and as the situations in China and Greece deteriorated. On balance,
trading the U.S. dollar against the currencies of Australia, the U.K., Canada, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Czech Republic, Sweden,
and Korea was unprofitable. Short euro trades versus several currencies were also unprofitable. The gain from a long U.S. dollar/short
Japanese yen trade provided a partial offset. 

Energy prices moved higher in April amid signs of a growth improvement
in Europe and a weakening dollar. Consequently, short positions in crude oil, crude oil products and natural gas generated losses
and were scaled back. 

Short positions in aluminum, copper, palladium, platinum, and silver
were profitable, particularly in May and June, as China s slowdown and equity turmoil led to reduced demand and some increased
supplies on world markets. Increased palladium and platinum production from South Africa also weighed on prices. Meanwhile, a
sharp swing in the price of zinc led to a loss on a long position, and trading of gold was also unprofitable. 

Grain prices, which have been falling rather persistently, rose
somewhat late in the period as heavy rains in the U.S. threatened to delay harvests of some crops and planting of others. Consequently,
losses on short corn and wheat positions outweighed the gains from long soybean and soybean meal trades. 

The losses on a short sugar position and trading of crude palm
oil slightly outweighed the gains from long cocoa positions and a short coffee trade. 

Three months ended March 31, 2015 

Solid first quarter performance was led by gains from trading of
financial markets interest rate and equity futures, and currency forwards. Commodity futures trading was nearly flat as
losses from trading grain futures were countered by gains from trading soft, metal and livestock futures. 

The European Central Bank s historic quantitative easing
announcement, several easing moves by the People s Bank of China and more than 20 other official interest rate reductions
led to sharp gains on long positions in U.S. interest rate futures across the yield curve. Long positions in German, Italian,
French, Canadian and Australian notes and bonds also registered profits. A long position in short-term sterling rates was profitable
as events suggested that any tightening of U.K. monetary policy would be delayed. 

The more accommodative monetary policy environment and some improvement
in growth indicators for Europe led to gains on long positions in Continental European, Chinese, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Australian
equity futures. On the other hand, a short Korean kospi futures trade was unprofitable. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures, after
reaching record levels, stagnated in the wake of the stronger dollar, disappointing earnings reports, and a first quarter growth
slowdown. 

Currency markets were volatile during the quarter, although a solid
U.S. economic outlook, generally higher relative interest rates, and some safe haven cachet underpinned the U.S. dollar. Still,
a tentative Russia/ Ukraine ceasefire and temporary bouts of sanity around the Greek crisis periodically took some steam out of
the dollar. Overall, long dollar positions versus the euro, Czech koruna, Swedish krona, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, and Canadian
dollar were profitable. On the other hand, a long U.S. dollar/short Swiss franc trade sustained a large loss when, on January
15, the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly ended the franc s peg to the euro and the franc soared 15%. Long U.S. dollar trades
against the South African, Norwegian and New Zealand currencies produced small losses. 

Grain prices recovered a bit after the USDA projected a reduction
in planting acreage for the current crop year. Consequently, short wheat positions, and to a lesser extent trading of corn, soybeans,
soybean meal, and bean oil produced minor losses. Coffee and sugar prices continued to fall and short positions in both were profitable.
Meanwhile, trading of cocoa, a short cotton position, and a long crude palm oil trade were unprofitable. A short hog trade was
marginally positive. 

Energy trading was flat as the gains from short WTI crude and U.S.
natural gas positions offset the losses from short Brent crude, heating oil and London gas oil trades. Metal trading was marginally
profitable with gains from short aluminum, silver and nickel positions and trading of gold outpacing the losses from short copper,
zinc, and platinum positions and trading of palladium. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

Neither the Partnership nor the Master Fund engages in off-balance
sheet arrangements with other entities. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  

Neither the Partnership nor the Master Fund enters into any contractual
obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments of a type that would be typical for an operating company or that
would affect its liquidity or capital resources. The Partnership s sole business, through its investment in the Master Fund,
is trading futures, forward currency, spot and swap contracts, both long (contracts to buy) and short (contacts to sell). All
such contracts are settled by offset, not delivery. Substantially all such contracts are for settlement within four months of
the trade date and substantially all such contracts are held by the Master Fund for less than four months before being offset
or rolled over into new contracts with similar maturities. The financial statements of the Master Fund present a condensed schedule
of investments setting forth open futures, forward and other contracts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
