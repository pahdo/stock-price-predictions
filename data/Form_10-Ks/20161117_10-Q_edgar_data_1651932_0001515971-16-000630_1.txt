All forward-looking statements are based on management s existing beliefs about present and future events outside of management s control and on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected or intended.            PART I - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         Item 1. Financial Statements.        September 30, 2016    C O N T E N T S                       Condensed Balance Sheets (unaudited)        3           Condensed Statements of Operations (unaudited)        4           Condensed Statements of Cash Flows (unaudited)        5           Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (unaudited)        6                                   2               CONCEPT HOLDING CORP.    Condensed Balance Sheets   September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed financial statements.             3               CONCEPT HOLDING CORP.    Condensed Statements of Operations   For the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (Unaudited)               The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed financial statements.             4               CONCEPT HOLDING CORP.    Condensed Statements of Cash Flows   For the Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (Unaudited)              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed financial statements.                      5          Concept Holding Corp.      Notes to Condensed Financial Statements     September 30, 2016     (Unaudited)         NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION        The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the period.       Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Audit Financial Statements for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.        NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN        The Company has minimal assets, has no established operations, and has accumulated losses since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. It is the intent of the Company to seek a merger with an existing, well-capitalized operating company. The Company will require additional funding during the next twelve months to finance the growth of its current operations and achieve its strategic objectives.  Management cannot make any assurances that such financing will be secured, and as such, there is a risk that operations may be curtailed in future periods.        NOTE 3 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS        On or about, February 23, 2015 the Company entered into two convertible promissory notes for $10,000 each.  The notes are due on February 23, 2017 and bear a 10% interest rate.  The balance due under the notes was $20,000 as of September 30, 2016 with $0 available under the notes.  An additional note for $10,000 dated January 20, 2016 with $0 available under the note, bears 12% interest and is due January 20, 2018.  Interest expense on related party loans for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016, totaled $849 and $1,539, respectively.  Subsequent to the date of this report, the President has provided additional funding in the amount of $6,000 that is due on demand until a new promissory note is accepted by the Company.        NOTE 4 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS          In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU No. 2014-09 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.       In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15   Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The update is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The impact on the Company s financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-15 is currently being assessed by management.       In August 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,  addressing eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and for interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.       The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operation, financial position or cash flows.  Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.            6          NOTE 5 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS        For purposes of these financial statements and all disclosures, subsequent events were evaluated through the date the financial statements were issued.       On October 19, 2016 the Company s common stock became quoted for trading under the symbol  CNHD .       On or about October 21, 2016 the Company received a loan from our President in the amount of $6,000 which is due and payable on demand until a new promissory note is accepted which may or may not provide for additional funds for the Company.  It is anticipated that such promissory note would reflect the same terms as the previous note at a rate of 12% annually.                7          Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         Forward-looking Statements        Statements made in this Quarterly Report which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives, intentions, expectations, financial condition, results of operations, future performance and our business, including, without limitation, (i) our ability to raise capital, and (ii) statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words  may,   would,   could,   should,   expects,   projects,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   plans,   intends,   targets  or similar expressions.       Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which we may conduct business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, our ability to raise capital, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters.       Accordingly, results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.  We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.        Plan of Operation        Our Company s plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which our Company may have an interest in seeking an acquisition or merger to bring an operating entity into the Company; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in business in any selected industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a going concern engaged in any industry selected.       During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining our good standing; the payment of our Securities and Exchange Commission fees and the Securities and Exchange of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), reporting requirement filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees; costs incident to reviewing or investigating any potential business venture; and maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization.  Because a principal shareholder has been paying all of the operating expenses, management does not anticipate that we will have to raise additional funds during the next 12 months.       On October 19, 2016 our common stock became quoted for trading under the symbol  CNHD .        Results of Operations         Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        We had no operations during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, nor do we have operations as of the date of this filing.  General and administrative expenses were $9,003 for the September 30, 2016, period, compared to $8,056 for the September 30, 2015, period. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were comprised mainly of accounting, legal and transfer agent expenses along with other office fees. We had a net loss of $9,852 for the September 30, 2016, period, compared to a net loss of $8,441 for the September 30, 2015, period.  The increase was mainly attributable to additional accounting expenses associated with our two separate auditor reports on our most recent Form 10-K Annual Report.        Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2015        We had no operations during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, nor do we have operations as of the date of this filing.  General and administrative expenses were $11,248 for the September 30, 2016, period, compared to $15,248 for the September 30, 2015, period. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016, were comprised mainly of accounting, legal and transfer agent expenses along with other office fees. We had a net loss of $12,787 for the September 30, 2016, period, compared to a net loss of $15,828 for the September 30, 2015, period.  The decrease was mainly attributable to additional accounting expenses associated with our Form 10 Registration Statement, as amended in 2015.            8          Liquidity and Capital Requirements        We had minimal cash or cash equivalents on hand at September 30, 2016 and $0 was available under existing promissory notes.  We have not entered into any additional financing agreements but anticipate that we will be relying on our President to extend another promissory note to meet our expenses.  The aggregate amount of $20,000 in loans bears 10% interest and is due February 23, 2017. An additional note for $10,000 dated January 20, 2016, bears 12% interest and is due January 20, 2018.  Interest expense on related party loans for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, totaled $849 and $285, respectively.  Interest expense for the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, totaled $1,539 and $480, respectively.  Because we have not identified any acquisition or venture, it is impossible to predict the amount of additional funds that will have to be raised.       See Subsequent Events of our Notes to Financial Statements regarding additional funds received.        Off-balance Sheet Arrangements        None.        Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.        Not required.        Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Secretary, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.       Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Secretary, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.  Based upon that evaluation, our President and Secretary concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        During the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.         PART II - OTHER INFORMATION           Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        None.         Item 1A. Risk Factors.        Not required.        Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.        None.         Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.        None; not applicable.             9          Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure.        We have no mining activities.        Item 5. Other Information.        On or about October 19, 2016, the Company was assigned the trading symbol  CNHD  by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ).       On or about October 21, 2016, the Company received a loan from our President in the amount of $6,000, which is due and payable on demand until a new promissory note is accepted, which may or may not provide for additional funds for the Company.  It is anticipated that such promissory note would reflect the same terms as the previous note at a rate of 12% annually.        Item 6. Exhibits.
