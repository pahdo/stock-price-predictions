Basis of Presentation      The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required to be included in a complete set of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the six months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2017. The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company s 2016 Annual Report filed with the SEC on July 29, 2016.      Forward Stock Split      On December 21, 2015, the Company filed, with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, a Certificate of Change, effecting a ten-for-one (10:1) forward split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common. The forward split took effect on the over-the counter markets on January 12, 2016. The number of shares, issued and outstanding and the weighted average for 2015 has been adjusted to reflect the forward stock split.      Inventory      Inventories are stated at the lower of cost of market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method of accounting.

Depreciation and amortization is provided principally on the straight-line basis method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         Executive Overview       BRK Inc. ( BRK  or the  Company ) was incorporated on May 22, 2008 as a Nevada corporation. The Company has developed a product for the repair of hanging venetian blinds. As part of this development the Company has completed the development and is building a machine to make the parts for blind repair that it is selling. The development and testing of the machine was completed with limited production following and the Company reduced its work in the blind repair kit market space.      On May 6, 2016, the Company acquired intangible assets from ISee Automation for 5,000,000 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $1,600,000 based on the Company s stock price at the date of issuance. The  intangible assets consist of a patent application and related know-how technology and plan for commercialization related to the placement of video cameras and supporting equipment into helmets used by various athletics such as hockey. Life video can then be transmitted from the player s helmet in real time for display on sports events broadcasts. The Company is in the process of receiving models produced by a third party and developing a marketing strategy for the devise.      As of the date of this filing we have minimal operations and have no revenues for the past two years. Our focus for the next twelve months will be to obtain additional funding to develop and expand our operations and new projects.Our success will depend on our ability to obtain funding through equity and/or debt transactions. However, with the downturn of the United States and world economies, we will encounter substantial competition for the limited financing that will be available in the market place. If we are unable to obtain financing, then we will likely delay further business development and marketing of our product.      In summary, management continues to position the company in a way to best benefit from worldwide economic conditions, trends, events, and demand for new technologies.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of October 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,163,085. We recorded a net loss of $767,267 for the six month period ended October 31, 2016. The net loss was $37,894 for the same period during 2015. Unless profitability and increases in stockholders  equity continues, these conditions raise substantial doubt as to BRK s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue limited operations until we obtain additional funding to expand our operations.      Working capital was negative $419,264 as of October 31, 2016, compared to negative $366,823 as of April 30, 2016. Cash used in operations totaled $134,003 during the six-month period ended October 31, 2016 compared to $17,922 during the same period in 2015. Funds provided from financing activities was $131,025 in 2016 compared with funds provided from financing activity of $18,000 in 2015.      Management expects to continue to issue debt to finance the Company. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined per our financial needs and the available exemptions. We also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock our shareholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock.      We intend to rely on debt and equity financing, capital contributions from management and sales of our common stock to pay for costs, services, operating leases, litigation expense and future development of our business opportunities. Accordingly, our focus for the next twelve months will be to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financing. Our success in obtaining funding will depend upon our ability to sell our common stock or borrow on terms that are financially advantageous to us. If we are unable to obtain financing, then expansion of our operations will be delayed.             Results of Operations       The Company recorded zero revenue during the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.      General and administrative expenses for the three and six-month period ended October 31, 2016 totaled $685,269 and $709,527 compared to $14,146 and $33,832 for the same periods in 2015. The increase for six-month period in 2016 over 2015 was due to variance in accounting, legal and consulting payments.     Depreciation and amortization was $27,676 and $54,826 for the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 compared to $705 and $2,022 for the same periods ended October 31, 2015. The depreciation was related to fixed assets consisting of a machine and molds with the mold fully depreciated in 2016 plus amortization for a patent purchased during the year ended October 31, 2016.      The Company incurred a net loss of $714,402 and $767,267 in the three and six-month period ended October 31, 2016 compared to $15,871 and $37,894 in the same periods in 2015. The variance in net loss was due to higher amortization cost in the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       None       ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not applicable.       ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures(as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the "Exchange Act"), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the lack of segregation of duties and lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. The material weakness relates to the lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting and all accounting functions are performed by an external consultant with no oversight by a professional with accounting expertise. Our CEO/CFO does not possess accounting expertise and our company does not have an audit committee. This weakness is due to the company s lack of working capital to hire additional staff. To remedy this material weakness, we intend to engage another accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      Except as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our first quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
