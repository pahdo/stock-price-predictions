   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   September 30, 2016    
   1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION       The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by AmerInst Insurance Group, Ltd. ( AmerInst ) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ). These financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial
position and results of operations as of the end of and for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated on consolidation. These statements are condensed and do not incorporate all the information required under U.S. GAAP to be included in a full set of financial statements. In these notes, the terms  we ,  us ,
 our  or the  Company  refer to AmerInst and its subsidiaries. These condensed statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes
thereto, included in AmerInst s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year then ended.        New Accounting Pronouncements
         Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted          Financial Instruments Credit Losses Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments        In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 ( ASU 2016-13 ), which amends the guidance on impairment of financial instruments and significantly changes how entities will
measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. ASU 2016-13 will replace the existing  incurred loss  approach, with an  expected loss  model
for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount under the existing other-than -temporary-impairment model. The ASU also simplifies the
accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this
guidance on our consolidated financial statements.        Revenue from Contracts with Customers     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU
2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 provides a framework, through a five-step process, for recognizing revenue from customers, improves comparability and consistency of recognizing revenue across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets, and
requires enhanced disclosures. Certain contracts with customers are specifically excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09, including; without limitation, insurance contracts accounted for under Accounting Standard Codification 944,  Financial
Services Insurance . ASU 2014-09 is effective on January 1, 2017 with retrospective adoption required for the comparative periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on future financial
statements and related disclosures.        Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
       In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). Currently, there is no guidance under U.S. GAAP regarding management s responsibility to assess whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern. Under ASU 2014-15, the Company will be required to assess its ability to continue as a going concern each interim and annual reporting period and provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about
the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, including management s plan to alleviate the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective annual periods ending December 31, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on future financial statements and related disclosures.   
    Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts        In May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-09,  Financial Services Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  ( ASU 2015-09 ). ASU
2015-09 provides enhanced disclosures, on an annual basis, related to the reserve for losses and loss expenses. The enhanced disclosures required by ASU 2015-09 include (1) net incurred and paid claims development information by accident year,
(2) a reconciliation of incurred and paid claims development information to the aggregate carrying amount of the reserve for losses and loss expenses, (3) for each accident year presented of incurred claims development information, the
total of reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR), including expected development on reported claims, included in the reserve for losses and loss expenses and a description of the reserving methodologies and changes to the reserving
methodologies, and (4) for each accident year presented of incurred claims development information, quantitative information about claims frequency, as well as a description of methodologies used for determining claim frequency information. ASU
2015-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and as such the disclosures will first be presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company is currently
assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2015-09 will have on future disclosures.

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10):
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 changes current U.S. GAAP for public entities by requiring the following, among others: (1) equity securities, except
those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) the use of the exit price when measuring fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
purposes; (3) an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure
the liability at fair value; and (4) separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or notes to the financial statements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on future financial statements and disclosures.
      2. INVESTMENTS       The cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains and losses, and estimated fair value of the Company s fixed maturity investments, by major security type, and equity securities as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:       
 
         7   

The following tables summarize the Company s fixed maturity and equity securities in an
unrealized loss position and the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position:       
    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 18 and 26 securities in an
unrealized loss position with an estimated fair value of $3,417,349 and $4,585,513, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 9 and 10 of these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or
greater, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of these securities were considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company has the intent to hold these securities for a sufficient period of time for
the value to recover and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before their fair value recover above the adjusted cost. The unrealized losses from these securities were not as a result of credit,
collateral or structural issues.      At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had investments in
certificates of deposit ( CD ) in the amount of $980,000 comprised of fully insured time deposits placed with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insured commercial banks and savings associations. The FDIC, an
independent agency of the United States government, protects depositors up to an amount of $250,000 per depositor, per insured institution. FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. The stated
interest rate of an FDIC insured CD varies greatly among commercial banks and savings associations, depending on the term of the CD and the institution s need for funding. The liquidity of  marketable  CDs is marginal, even though
they are assigned an FDIC number, a CUSIP number and are held in book-entry form through the Depository Trust Company. Depending on market liquidity and conditions, the bid price for an FDIC insured CD would reflect the supply of and the demand for
deposits of the particular bank or savings association, as well as prevailing interest rates, the remaining term of the deposit, specific features of the CD, and compensation of the broker arranging the sale of the CD. These time deposits have
maturities ranging from less than one year to two years and are classified as other invested assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.   
         8   

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Process     
  The Company assesses whether declines in the fair value of its fixed maturity investments classified as available-for-sale represent
impairments that are other-than-temporary by reviewing each fixed maturity investment that is impaired and (1) determining if the Company has the intent to sell the fixed maturity investment or if it is more likely than not that the
Company will be required to sell the fixed maturity investment before its anticipated recovery; and (2) assessing whether a credit loss exists, that is, where the Company expects that the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected
from the fixed maturity investment are less than the amortized cost basis of the investment.      The Company had no planned sales
of its fixed maturity investments classified as available-for-sale that were in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016. In assessing whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a fixed maturity
investment before its anticipated recovery, the Company considers various factors including its future cash flow requirements, legal and regulatory requirements, the level of its cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and fixed maturity
investments available for sale in an unrealized gain position, and other relevant factors. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairments due to sales.   
  In evaluating credit losses, the Company considers a variety of factors in the assessment of a fixed maturity investment including:
(1) the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost; (2) the extent of the decline below cost and par; (3) the potential for the fixed maturity investment to recover in value; (4) an analysis of the
financial condition of the issuer; (5) the rating of the issuer; and (6) failure of the issuer of the fixed maturity investment to make scheduled interest or principal payments.   
  Equity securities are reviewed on a regular basis to determine if they have sustained an impairment of value that is considered to be
other than temporary. Several factors are considered in the assessment of an investment, which include (i) the extent of the decline below cost, and (ii) the potential for the security to recover in value.   
  If we conclude a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, we write down the amortized cost of the security to fair value, with a
charge to net realized investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Gross unrealized losses on the investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, relating to 6 and 11 fixed maturity
securities, amounted to $10,967 and $18,853, respectively, and 12 and 15 equity securities, amounted to $52,092 and $87,838, respectively. The unrealized losses on these available for sale fixed maturity securities were not as a result of credit,
collateral or structural issues. During the nine months ended and three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a total other-than-temporary impairment charge of $219,417 and $98,301 on four and two equity security, respectively,
as a result of the decline in fair value below cost. During the nine months ended and three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a total other-than-temporary impairment charge of $536,806 and $297,986 on four and one equity
securities, respectively, as a result of the decline in fair value below cost.        Fair Value of Investments     
  Under existing U.S. GAAP, we are required to recognize certain assets at their fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. This
includes our fixed maturity investments and equity securities. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820, fair value is
defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair
value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon whether the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability are observable or unobservable in the market at the measurement date, with quoted market prices being the highest level (Level 1)
and unobservable inputs being the lowest level (Level 3). A fair value measurement will fall within the level of the hierarchy based on the inputs that are significant to determining such measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:

Level 1 : Observable inputs to the valuation methodology that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets.          

Level 2 : Observable inputs to the valuation methodology other than quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in
active markets. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.          

Level 3 : Inputs to the valuation methodology that are unobservable for the asset or liability.      
         9   

At each measurement date, we estimate the fair value of the security using various valuation
techniques. We utilize, to the extent available, quoted market prices in active markets or observable market inputs in estimating the fair value of our investments. When quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not available, we utilize
valuation techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of investments. The following describes the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair value of investments held as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 and what level within the fair value hierarchy each valuation technique resides:       

U.S. government agency securities : Comprised primarily of bonds issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, Federal Farm Credit Bank and the Federal National Mortgage Association. The fair values of U.S. government agency securities are priced using the spread above the risk-free U.S. Treasury yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free U.S.
Treasury yield curve are observable market inputs, the fair values of U.S. government agency securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company considers a liquid market to exist for these types of securities held. Broker
quotes are not used for fair value pricing.          

Obligations of state and political subdivisions : Comprised of fixed income obligations of state and local governmental municipalities. The fair
values of these securities are based on quotes and current market spread relationships, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company considers a liquid market to exist for these types of securities held. Broker quotes are
not used for fair value pricing.          

Corporate debt securities : Comprised of bonds issued by corporations. The fair values of these securities are based on quotes and current market
spread relationships, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company considers a liquid market to exist for these types of securities held. Broker quotes are not used for fair value pricing.      

Equity securities, at fair value : Comprised primarily of investments in the common stock of publicly traded companies in the U.S. All of the
Company s equities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company receives prices based on closing exchange prices from independent pricing sources to measure fair values for the equities.      

Hedge fund : Comprised of a hedge fund whose objective is to seek attractive long-term returns with lower volatility by investing in a range of
diversified investment strategies. The fund invests in a diversified pool of hedge fund managers, generally across six different strategies: long/short equities, long/short credit, macro, multi-strategy opportunistic, event-driven, and portfolio
hedge. The fair value of the hedge fund is based on the net asset value of the fund as reported by the external fund manager. The use of net asset value as an estimate of the fair value for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset
value is a permitted practical expedient. Redemptions of the hedge fund occur on a quarterly basis, with required notice of 95 days. In accordance with Subtopic 820-10, the fair value of our hedge fund is not classified in the fair value hierarchy.
        While we obtain pricing from independent pricing services, management is ultimately responsible for
determining the fair value measurements for all securities. To ensure fair value measurement is applied consistently and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we periodically update our understanding of the pricing methodologies used by the independent
pricing services. We also undertake further analysis with respect to prices we believe may not be representative of fair value under current market conditions. Our review process includes, but is not limited to: (i) initial and ongoing
evaluation of the pricing methodologies and valuation models used by outside parties to calculate fair value; (ii) quantitative analysis; (iii) a review of multiple quotes obtained in the pricing process and the range of resulting fair
values for each security, if available, and (iv) randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing the executed prices to the fair value estimates provided by the independent pricing sources.   
         10   

There have been no material changes to our valuation techniques from what was used as of
December 31, 2015. Since the fair value of a security is an estimate of what a willing buyer would pay for such security if we sold it, we cannot know the ultimate value of our securities until they are sold. We believe the valuation techniques
utilized provide us with a reasonable estimate of the price that would be received if we were to sell our assets or transfer our liabilities in an orderly market transaction between participants at the measurement date. The following tables show the
fair value of the Company s investments in accordance with ASC 820 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       

(a)

4. STOCK COMPENSATION       AmerInst Professional Services, Limited ( APSL ), a subsidiary of AmerInst, has employment agreements with four key members of senior management, including one of our named executive officers,
Kyle Nieman, the President of APSL, which grant them phantom shares of the Company. Under these agreements, these employees were initially granted an aggregate of 75,018 phantom shares of the Company on the date of their employment, subject to
certain vesting requirements. The phantom shares are eligible for phantom dividends payable at the same rate as regular dividends on the Company s common shares. The phantom dividends may be used only to purchase additional phantom shares
with the purchase price of such phantom shares being the net book value of the Company s actual common shares as of the end of the previous quarter. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, 798 and 1,569 phantom shares
were granted, respectively, arising from the dividends declared on the Company s common shares. 84,725 phantom shares were outstanding at September 30, 2016.      For three of these employees, including Mr. Nieman, the phantom shares initially granted, as well as any additional shares granted from dividends declared, vested on January 1, 2015. For the
fourth employee, the phantom shares initially granted, as well as any additional shares granted from dividends declared, will vest on January 1, 2018. The liability payable to these employees under the phantom share agreements is equal to the
value of the phantom shares based on the net book value of the Company s actual common shares at the end of the previous quarter less the value of phantom shares initially granted and is payable in cash upon the earlier of the employee
attaining 65 years of age or within 60 days of such employee s death or permanent disability, including if such death or permanent disability occurs before January 1, 2018 for the fourth employee.   
  The liability relating to these phantom shares is recalculated quarterly based on the net book value of the Company s common shares
at the end of each quarter. As a result of the overall decrease in the net book value of the Company s common shares since the grant dates, no liability has been recorded by the Company relating to these phantom shares at September 30,
2016.

      OVERVIEW    
  Unless otherwise indicated by the context in this quarterly report, we refer to AmerInst Insurance Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries as the
 Company,   AmerInst,   we  or  us.   AMIC Ltd.  means AmerInst s wholly owned subsidiary, AmerInst Insurance Company, Ltd.  APSL  means AmerInst Professional Services, Limited, a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of AmerInst Mezco, Ltd. which is a wholly owned subsidiary of AmerInst.  Investco  means AmerInst Investment Company, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of AMIC Ltd. Our principal offices are
c/o Citadel Management Bermuda Limited, 25 Church Street, Continental Building, P.O. Box HM 1601, Hamilton, Bermuda, HM GX.   
  AmerInst Insurance Group, Ltd. is a Bermuda holding company formed in 1998 that provides insurance protection for professional service
firms and engages in investment activities. AmerInst has two reportable segments: (1) reinsurance activity, which includes investments and other activities, and (2) insurance activity, which offers professional liability solutions to
professional service firms. The revenues of the reinsurance activity reportable segment and the insurance activity reportable segment were $6,891,340 and $2,957,429 respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$4,594,051 and $2,187,080, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The revenues for both reportable segments were derived from business operations in the United States other than interest income on bank accounts maintained
in Bermuda.   
         14   

Entry into Agency Agreement     
  On September 25, 2009, APSL entered into an agency agreement (the  Agency Agreement ) with The North River Insurance
Company, United States Fire Insurance Company, Crum   Forster Indemnity Company, Crum and Forster Insurance Company, and Crum   Forster Specialty Insurance Company (collectively,  C F ) pursuant to which C F
appointed APSL as its exclusive agent for the purposes of soliciting, underwriting, quoting, binding, issuing, cancelling, non-renewing and endorsing accountants  professional liability and lawyers  professional liability insurance
coverage in all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia. The initial term of the Agency Agreement was for four years with automatic one-year renewals thereafter. The Agency Agreement automatically renewed on September 25,
2016.        Entry into Reinsurance Agreement        We conduct our reinsurance business through AMIC Ltd., our subsidiary, which is a registered insurer in Bermuda. On September 25, 2009, AMIC Ltd. entered into a professional liability quota share
agreement with C F (the  Reinsurance Agreement ) pursuant to which C F agreed to cede, and AMIC Ltd. agreed to accept as reinsurance, a 50% quota share of C F s liability under insurance written by APSL on behalf of
C F and classified by C F as accountants  professional liability and lawyers  professional liability, subject to AMIC Ltd. s surplus limitations. The term of the Reinsurance Agreement is continuous and may be terminated by
either party upon at least 120 days  prior written notice.        Historical Relationship with CAMICO     
  From June 1, 2005 through May 31, 2009, we were a party to a reinsurance contract with CAMICO Mutual Insurance Company
( CAMICO ), a California-based writer of accountants  professional liability business.      We decided not to renew
the CAMICO contract and permitted the contract to expire pursuant to its terms on May 31, 2009. We remain potentially liable for claims related to coverage through May 31, 2009.   
    Third-party Managers and Service Providers        Citadel Management Bermuda Limited (formerly Cedar Management Limited) provides the day-to-day services necessary for the administration of our business. Our agreement with Citadel Management Bermuda
Limited renewed for one year beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2016. Mr. Thomas R. McMahon, our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, is a shareholder, officer, director and employee of Citadel Management Bermuda
Limited. Mr. Stuart Grayston, our President, was formerly a director and officer of Cedar Management Limited.   
  Mr. Lawrence Carlson, a certified public accountant and an independent contractor, provides the primary accounting functions to
APSL. Our agreement with him, which was effective January 1, 2013, has no ending date but can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice.      The Country Club Bank of Kansas City, Missouri, provides portfolio management of fixed-income securities and directs our investments pursuant to guidelines approved by us. Harris Associates L.P., Aurora
Investment Management, LLC and Tower Wealth Managers, Inc. provide discretionary investment advice with respect to our equity investments. We have retained Oliver Wyman, an independent casualty actuarial consulting firm, to render advice regarding
actuarial matters.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015       We recorded net income of $1,043,717 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $764,460 for the same period in 2015. The increase in net income was mainly attributable to
the increase in commission income from $2,185,785 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2,957,272 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of a higher volume of premiums written under the Agency Agreement and to
the increase in realized gains on investments net of impairment from $464,772 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,720,881 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of increased sales of equity securities in an
unrealized gain position during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This was partially offset by the increase in operating and management expenses from $3,437,629 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to
$3,720,350 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as discussed in further detail below.      Our net premiums earned
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,960,678 compared to $3,944,388 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,016,290 or 25.8%. The net premiums earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were attributable to cessions from C F under the Reinsurance Agreement. The increase in net premiums earned under the Reinsurance Agreement during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 resulted from increased
cessions from C F in 2016, arising from a higher level of underwriting activity under the Agency Agreement due to the continued marketing of the program by APSL resulting in increasing penetration in targeted markets.   
         15   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded commission income
under the Agency Agreement of $2,957,272 and $2,185,785, respectively, an increase of $771,487 or 35.3%. This increase resulted from a higher volume of premiums written under the Agency Agreement in 2016 due to the continued marketing of the program
by APSL resulting in increasing penetration in the targeted markets.      We recorded net investment income of $209,938 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $186,186 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net investment income was due to the increase in dividend income, which was attributable to higher yielding equity
securities held in the Company s investment portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The annualized investment yield, calculated as total interest and dividends divided by the net
average amount of total investments and cash and cash equivalents, was 1.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the .95% yield earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
  Sales of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in realized gains on investments net of impairment of
$1,720,881 compared to $464,772 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,256,109. The increase in realized gains primarily related to increased sales of equity securities in an unrealized gain position during the
first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded
loss and loss adjustment expenses of $3,249,245 derived by multiplying our estimated loss ratio of 65.5% and the net premiums earned under the Reinsurance Agreement of $4,960,678. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded loss
and loss adjustment expenses of $2,648,532, which represents (i) $2,583,574 in losses derived by multiplying our estimated loss ratio of 65.5% and the net premiums earned under the Reinsurance Agreement of $3,944,388 and (ii) $64,958 in
additional losses under the Reinsurance Agreement which resulted from unfavorable development in policy years 2010 and 2014. The increase in loss and loss adjustment expense was primarily due to an increase in net premiums earned during the first
nine months of 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015.      We recorded policy acquisition costs of $1,835,457 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,459,430 for the same period in 2015. Policy acquisition costs, which are primarily ceding commissions paid to the ceding insurer, are established as a percentage of premiums earned; therefore,
any increase or decrease in premiums earned will result in a similar increase or decrease in policy acquisition costs. The policy acquisition costs recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 37% of the net premiums
earned under the Reinsurance Agreement of $4,960,678 and $3,944,388, respectively.      We expensed operating and management
expenses of $3,720,350 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,437,629 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $282,721 or 8.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to increased net commissions paid to outside
brokers in association with the Agency Agreement.      The tables below summarize the results of the following AmerInst reportable
segments: (1) reinsurance activity, which also includes investments and other activities, and (2) insurance activity, which offers professional liability solutions to professional service firms under the Agency Agreement with C F.
      
     Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015    
  We recorded net income of $762,897 during the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $350,085 for the same period in 2015. The
increase in net income was mainly attributable to the increase in commission income from $728,969 in the third quarter of 2015 to $976,514 in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of a higher volume of premiums written under the Agency Agreement and
to the increase in realized gains on investments net of impairment from $7,576 in the third quarter of 2015 to $960,767 in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of increased sales of equity securities in an unrealized gain position during the third
quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This was partially offset by the increase in operating and management expenses from $1,042,206 in the third quarter of 2015 to $1,192,097 in the third quarter of 2016, as discussed in further
detail below.   
         16   

Our net premiums earned for the third quarter of 2016 were $1,844,243 compared to $1,406,901
for the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $437,342 or 31.1%. The net premiums earned during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were attributable to cessions from C F under the Reinsurance Agreement. The increased cessions
arose from a higher level of underwriting activity under the Agency Agreement due to the continued marketing of the program by APSL, which resulted in increased penetration in targeted markets.   
  For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded commission income under the Agency Agreement of $976,514 and
$728,969, respectively, an increase of $247,545 or 34%. This increase resulted from a higher volume of premiums written under the Agency Agreement in 2016 due to the continued marketing of the program by APSL resulting in increasing penetration in
the targeted markets.      We recorded net investment income of $63,821 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$55,709 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net investment income was due to a larger base of fixed income securities held in the Company s investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015. The annualized investment yield, calculated as total interest and dividends divided by the net average amount of total investments and cash and cash equivalents, was .90% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the
..84% yield earned for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.      Sales of securities for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 resulted in realized gains on investments net of impairment of $960,767 compared to $7,576 during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $953,191. The increase in realized gains primarily related to
increased sales of equity securities in an unrealized gain position during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.      For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses of $1,207,979 derived by multiplying our estimated loss ratio of 65.5% and the net premiums earned under the
Reinsurance Agreement of $1,844,243. For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses of $986,478, which represents (i) $921,520 in losses derived by multiplying our estimated loss ratio of 65.5% and
the net premiums earned under the Reinsurance Agreement of $1,406,901 and (ii) $64,958 in additional losses under the Reinsurance Agreement which resulted from unfavorable development in policy years 2010 and 2014. The increase in loss and loss
adjustment expense was primarily due to an increase in net premiums earned during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015.      We recorded policy acquisition costs of $682,372 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $520,556 for the same period in 2015. Policy acquisition costs, which are primarily ceding commissions paid to the
ceding insurer, are established as a percentage of premiums earned; therefore, any increase or decrease in premiums earned will result in a similar increase or decrease in policy acquisition costs. The policy acquisition costs recorded during the
third quarter of 2016 and 2015 were 37% of the net premiums earned under the Reinsurance Agreement of $1,844,243 and $1,406,901, respectively.      We incurred operating and management expenses of $1,192,097 in the third quarter 2016 compared to $1,042,206 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $149,891 or 14.4%. The increase was primarily
attributable to increased net commissions paid to outside brokers in association with the Agency Agreement.      The tables below
summarize the results of the following AmerInst reportable segments: (1) reinsurance activity, which also includes investments and other activities, and (2) insurance activity, which offers professional liability solutions to professional
service firms under the Agency Agreement with C F.       
 
         17   

FINANCIAL CONDITION       As of September 30, 2016, our total investments were $23,358,613 an increase of $964,582 from $22,394,031 at December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to the purchase of additional fixed income
securities and equity securities during the first nine months of 2016. The cash and cash equivalents balance increased from $3,073,747 at December 31, 2015 to $4,111,302 at September 30, 2016, an increase of $1,037,555 or 33.8%. The amount
of cash and cash equivalents varies depending on the maturities of fixed-term investments and on the level of funds invested in money market funds. The restricted cash and cash equivalents balance decreased from $608,370 at December 31, 2015 to
$9,788 at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $598,582 or 98.4%. The decrease is primarily due to the reallocation from restricted cash through the purchases of additional restricted fixed income securities during the first nine months of 2016.
Other invested assets remained unchanged at $980,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The ratio of cash, total investments and other invested assets to total liabilities at September 30, 2016 was 1.77:1, compared to a
ratio of 2.10:1 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the ratio was attributable to an increase in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premium assumed under the Reinsurance Agreement.   
  The assumed reinsurance balances receivable represents the current assumed premiums receivable less commissions payable to the fronting
carriers. As of September 30, 2016, the balance was $1,235,637 compared to $1,031,992 as of December 31, 2015. The increase resulted from a higher level of premiums assumed under the Reinsurance Agreement.   
  The assumed reinsurance payable represents current reinsurance losses payable to the fronting carriers. As of September 30, 2016,
the balance was $9 compared to $269,055 as of December 31, 2015. This balance fluctuates due to the timing of reported losses under the policies we reinsure.      Deferred policy acquisition costs, which represent the deferral of ceding commission expense related to premiums not yet earned, increased from $1,066,789 at December 31, 2015 to $1,433,389 at
September 30, 2016. The increase in deferred policy acquisition costs in 2015 was due to the increase in both net premiums written and unearned premiums assumed under the Reinsurance Agreement compared to the prior year. The ceding commission
rate under the Reinsurance Agreement is 37%.      Prepaid expenses and other assets were $2,125,290 at September 30, 2016, an
increase of 103.9% from December 31, 2015. Prepaid expenses and other assets primarily includes: (1) prepaid directors  and officers  liability insurance costs, (2) prepaid directors  retainers, (3) prepaid
professional fees, (4) premiums due to APSL under the Agency Agreement and (5) a payment due to the Company in relation to the partial redemption of the Company s hedge fund investment during the third quarter of 2016. The increase in
the balance at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was mainly attributable to the payment due to the Company in the amount of $1,154,403 for a partial redemption of the Company s hedge fund investment. This payment was
received on October 7, 2016.      Accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily represent premiums payable by APSL to
C F under the Agency Agreement and expenses accrued relating largely to professional fees. The balance decreased from $3,129,906 at December 31, 2015 to $3,040,890 at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $89,016 or 2.8%. This balance
fluctuates due to the timing of the premium payments to C F.   
         18   

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    
  Our cash needs consist of settlement of losses and expenses under our reinsurance treaties and funding day-to-day operations. In
continuing the implementation of our business plan, our management expects to meet these cash needs from cash flows arising from our investment portfolio. Because substantially all of our assets are marketable securities, we expect that we will have
sufficient flexibility to provide for unbudgeted cash needs that may arise from time to time without resorting to borrowing, subject to Bermuda statutory limitations as discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K.   
  Total cash, investments and other invested assets increased from $27,056,148 at December 31, 2015 to $28,459,703 at
September 30, 2016, an increase of $1,403,555 or 5.2%. The net increase resulted primarily from positive cash inflows derived from net investment income and net premiums received under the Reinsurance Agreement in the amount of $2,587,990,
partially offset by the decrease in the fair value of certain equity securities as a result of unfavorable market conditions and cash dividends paid of $305,759 during the year.   
  The Bermuda Monetary Authority has authorized Investco to purchase the Company s common shares, on a negotiated basis, from
shareholders who have died or retired from the practice of public accounting. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no such transactions occurred. Through September 30, 2016, Investco had repurchased 186,283 common shares from
shareholders who had died or retired for a total purchase price of $5,287,359. From time to time, Investco has also purchased shares in privately negotiated transactions. Through September 30, 2016, Investco had purchased an additional 75,069
common shares in such privately negotiated transactions for a total purchase price of $1,109,025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no such transactions occurred.       Cash Dividends       We paid dividends of $0.25 per share during the first and
third quarters of 2016, which amounted to total ordinary cash dividends of $162,414 and $163,065, respectively. The dividends paid in 2016 have been reduced by $19,720, which represents a write-back of uncashed dividends issued prior to 2011 to
shareholders that we have been unable to locate. Since we began paying dividends in 1995, our original shareholders have received $21.37 in cumulative dividends per share. When measured by a total rate of return calculation, this has resulted in an
effective annual rate of return of approximately 8.7% from the inception of the Company, based on a per share purchase price of $8.33 paid by the original shareholders, and using an unaudited net book value of $26.83 per share as of
September 30, 2016. Although we have paid cash dividends on a regular basis in the past, the declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our
financial condition, results of operations, current and anticipated cash needs and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant.       OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS       AmerInst is not a party to any off-balance

Item 4.   
   Controls and Procedures           Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        As of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q,
our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based
upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer each concluded that as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we maintained effective disclosure controls and procedures.
       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has reviewed our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.       Part II OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.   
   Legal Proceedings         We are
party to various legal proceedings generally arising in the normal course of our business. While any proceeding contains an element of uncertainty, we do not believe that the eventual outcome of any litigation or arbitration proceeding to which we
are presently a party will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or business. Pursuant to our insurance and reinsurance agreements, disputes are generally required to be finally settled by arbitration.   
         20   

Item 1A.   
   Risk Factors         In addition
to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent
quarterly reports. The risks described in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
