  OVERVIEW     Time Warner is
a leading media and entertainment company whose major businesses encompass an array of the most respected and successful media brands. Among the Company s brands are TNT, TBS, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, CNN, HBO, Cinemax, Warner Bros. and New
Line Cinema. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated Revenues of $21.427 billion (up 2% from $21.039 billion in 2015), Operating Income of $5.856 billion (up 7% from $5.479 billion in 2015), Income from continuing
operations of $3.597 billion (up 22% from $2.938 billion in 2015), Net Income attributable to Time Warner shareholders of $3.633 billion (up 22% from $2.976 billion in 2015) and Cash provided by operations of $3.534 billion (up 18% from $2.997
billion in 2015).     Time Warner Businesses   
 Time Warner classifies its operations into three reportable segments: Turner, Home Box Office and Warner Bros. For additional
information regarding Time Warner s segments, refer to Note 14,  Segment Information,  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  
   Turner.    The Turner segment consists of businesses managed by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
( Turner ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Turner segment recorded Revenues of $8.526 billion (39% of the Company s total Revenues) and Operating Income of $3.531 billion.  
 Turner operates domestic and international television networks and related properties that offer entertainment, sports, kids
and news programming on television and digital platforms for consumers around the world. The Turner networks and related properties include TNT, TBS, Adult Swim, truTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, Cartoon Network, Boomerang, CNN and HLN.
The Turner networks generate revenues principally from licensing programming to affiliates that have contracted to receive and distribute this programming to subscribers, from the sale of advertising and from licensing its original programming,
including to over-the-top ( OTT ) services such as subscription-video-on-demand ( SVOD ) services, and its brands and characters for consumer products and other business ventures. Turner s programming is available to
audiences for viewing live and on demand across television, mobile devices and other digital platforms through services provided by affiliates and on Turner s digital properties. Turner also owns and operates various digital media businesses,
including  Bleacher Report ; the CNN digital properties, including  CNNgo ,  CNN.com  and  CNNMoney.com ; and other digital properties associated with its networks, all of which generate revenues principally from the sale of
advertising and sponsorships. In addition, Turner manages and operates sports-related digital properties in conjunction with associated television rights, such as  NBA Digital  and  NCAA.com , which also generate revenues primarily from
the sale of advertising and sponsorships.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
  OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION   (Continued)   
   
    Home Box Office.    The Home Box Office segment
consists of businesses managed by Home Box Office, Inc. ( Home Box Office ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Home Box Office segment recorded Revenues of $4.399 billion (21% of the Company s total Revenues)
and Operating Income of $1.488 billion.    Home Box Office operates the HBO and Cinemax multichannel premium pay television
services, with the HBO service ranking as the most widely distributed multichannel premium pay television service. HBO- and Cinemax-branded premium pay, basic tier television or OTT services are distributed in over 60 countries in Latin America,
Asia and Europe.    In the U.S., Home Box Office generates revenues principally from licensing programming to affiliates
that have contracted to receive and distribute such programming to their customers who subscribe to the HBO or Cinemax services. HBO and Cinemax programming is available in the U.S. to subscribers of affiliates for viewing on Home Box Office s
main HBO and Cinemax channels and its multiplex channels, through its on demand services, HBO On Demand and Cinemax On Demand, and through its broadband-delivered on demand services, HBO GO and MAX GO. HBO GO and MAX GO are available on a variety of
digital platforms, including mobile devices, gaming consoles and internet-connected streaming devices and televisions. In April 2015, Home Box Office launched HBO NOW, an OTT service available to consumers in the U.S. Home Box Office s
agreements with its domestic affiliates are typically long-term arrangements that provide for annual service fee increases and marketing support. While fees to Home Box Office under affiliate agreements are generally based on the number of
subscribers served by the affiliates, the relationship between subscriber totals and the amount of revenues earned depends on the specific terms of the applicable agreement, which may include basic and/or pay television subscriber thresholds, volume
discounts and other performance-based discounts. Marketing and promotional activities intended to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers may also impact revenue earned.  
 Internationally, Home Box Office generates subscription revenues by providing country-specific HBO and Cinemax premium pay and
basic tier television services to international affiliates that have contracted to receive and distribute such services to their local customers. In some countries, Home Box Office also generates subscription revenues from OTT services that are
distributed to consumers either directly or through third parties. Additional sources of revenues for Home Box Office are the home entertainment sales of its original programming, including  Game of Thrones ,  True Detective ,  True
Blood  and  Girls , via physical and digital formats and the licensing of its original programming to OTT services, including SVOD services, and international television networks.  
   Warner Bros.    The Warner Bros. segment consists of businesses managed by Warner Bros. Entertainment
Inc. ( Warner Bros. ) that principally produce and distribute television shows, feature films and videogames. Warner Bros.  television, film and videogame businesses benefit from a shared infrastructure, including shared production,
distribution, marketing and administrative functions and resources. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Warner Bros. segment recorded Revenues of $9.169 billion (40% of the Company s total Revenues) and Operating Income of
$1.160 billion.        Warner Bros. is a leader in television production and distribution. For the 2016/2017
season, Warner Bros. is producing over 65 original series in the U.S., including (i) at least three series for each of the five broadcast networks (including  2 Broke Girls ,  Arrow ,  The Bachelor ,  The Big Bang Theory ,
 Blindspot ,  DC s Legends of Tomorrow ,  The Flash ,  Gotham ,  Little Big Shots ,  Lucifer ,  The Middle ,  Mom ,  Supergirl ,  Supernatural ,  Vampire Diaries  and  The Voice ),
(ii) series for basic cable networks (including  Animal Kingdom ,  People of Earth  and  Pretty Little Liars ), (iii) series for premium pay television services (including  The Leftovers ,  Shameless  and
 Westworld ), (iv) series for SVOD services (including  Fuller House ,  Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life  and  Longmire ), (v) series for first-run syndication (including  The Ellen DeGeneres Show ,
 Extra ,  The Real  and  TMZ ) and (vi) animated series for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim (including  Be Cool, Scooby Doo! ,  Mike Tyson Mysteries ,  Teen Titans Go!  and  Wabbit ). Warner
Bros. also licenses the rights to many of its U.S. original television series in international territories. Outside the U.S., Warner Bros. has a global network of production companies in many countries (located across Europe and South America and in
Australia and New Zealand), which allows Warner Bros. to develop programming specifically tailored for the audiences in these territories. These local production companies also focus on developing non-scripted programs and formats that can be
adapted and sold internationally and in the U.S. Warner Bros. generates television product revenues principally from the licensing of programs to broadcast and cable television networks and premium pay television and OTT services, including SVOD
services.    Warner Bros. is a leader in the feature film industry and produces feature films under its Warner Bros. and New
Line Cinema banners. The Warner Bros. segment s theatrical product revenues are generated principally through rental fees from theatrical

exhibition of feature films, including the following recently released films:  The Accountant ,  Barbershop: The Next Cut ,  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ,  Central
Intelligence ,  The Conjuring 2 ,  The Legend of Tarzan, Lights Out ,  Me Before You ,  Storks, Suicide Squad  and  Sully  and subsequently through licensing fees received from the distribution of films on premium pay
television, broadcast and cable television networks and OTT services, including SVOD services.    Warner Bros. is a leader
in the home entertainment and videogame industries. The segment generates television and theatrical product revenues from the distribution of television and theatrical product in various physical and digital formats (e.g., electronic sell-through
( EST ) and video-on-demand). In addition, the segment generates revenues through the development and distribution of videogames, including the following recently released videogames:  LEGO Marvel s Avengers ,  LEGO Star Wars:
The Force Awakens  and  Mortal Kombat XL .    The distribution and sale of home entertainment product in physical
formats is a large contributor to the segment s revenues and profits. For the past several years, sales of home entertainment product in physical formats have declined as the home entertainment industry has been undergoing significant changes
as it transitions from the physical distribution of film and television content via physical discs to the electronic delivery of such content. Several factors have contributed to this decline, including consumers shifting to OTT services, which
generate significantly less revenue per transaction for the Company than sales of home entertainment product in physical formats; changing retailer initiatives and strategies (e.g., reduction of floor space devoted to home entertainment product in
physical formats); retail store closures; increasing competition for consumer discretionary time and spending; and piracy. During the first nine months of 2016, across the home entertainment industry, consumer spending on home entertainment product
in physical formats continued to decline and consumer spending on electronic delivery continued to increase. The electronic delivery of film and television content is growing and becoming more important to the Warner Bros. segment, which has helped
to offset some of the decline in sales of home entertainment product in physical formats.     Television Industry   
 The television industry is continuing to evolve, with changes in technology, rapid growth in new video services, and a
corresponding increase in overall video content consumption and shift in consumer viewing patterns. Consumers are watching an increasing amount of programming on-demand and across a wide variety of services and devices, including smartphones,
tablets, PCs and internet-connected televisions. Over the past few years, the number of multichannel video service ( MVPD ) subscribers in the U.S. declined slightly, and the Company expects further modest declines. To counteract this
trend, some MVPD providers are placing greater emphasis on selling smaller bundles of cable networks, resulting in higher subscriber declines for most individual networks than for MVPDs in total.  
 At the same time, the penetration of broadband and internet-connected devices has grown, which has led to a growing number and
variety of internet-delivered video services that do not require a traditional MVPD subscription or MVPD provider set-top box hardware. These include SVOD services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix, which have continued to increase their number
of subscribers and have been, and are expected to continue, making significant investments in acquired and original programming. Some television networks have launched OTT services, such as HBO NOW. In addition, MVPD providers as well as media and
technology companies have launched, or have announced that they will launch, virtual MVPDs, which offer bundles of networks delivered via the internet. Ad-supported broadband video services, such as those offered through YouTube and Facebook, also
have continued to gain in popularity.    As a result of these changes, consumers have more options for obtaining video
content, including lower-cost alternatives. At the same time, however, the combination of new competitors, changes in viewing habits and declines in MVPD subscribers has negatively affected overall television ratings and, as a result, television
advertising revenues for the industry and certain of the Company s networks. There also has been a corresponding shift of advertising dollars to non-traditional video outlets.  
 To address these changes, the Company s strategy over the past few years has focused on strengthening its position within
the traditional TV ecosystem, enhancing the value of traditional pay television subscriptions for consumers, and pursuing new opportunities outside the traditional TV ecosystem. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to continue increasing its
investment in high-quality distinctive programming to enhance the value of its networks. The Company is also working to enhance the value to consumers of the traditional MVPD bundle and capitalize on the shift in consumption habits in a number of
ways, including by expanding the amount of its content that is available on demand and supporting the development of better user interfaces for on-demand multiplatform viewing. The Company is also pursuing a number of initiatives to capitalize on
the new opportunities presented by these changes, including launching, investing in, and obtaining distribution through OTT services, including through

virtual MVPDs, as well as investing in short-form content production and digital-first news and entertainment networks. In addition, Turner has introduced new advertising products that provide
greater data analytic tools and targeting capabilities to advertisers in order to compete more effectively with non-traditional outlets.     Recent
Developments       AT T and Time Warner Merger Agreement    
 On October 22, 2016, Time Warner entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with
AT T Inc. ( AT T ), pursuant to which Time Warner will combine with AT T in a stock-and-cash transaction. The Merger Agreement has been approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies. Subject to the
conditions in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Time Warner s stockholders will receive $107.50 per share under the terms of the Merger Agreement, consisting of $53.75 per share in cash and $53.75 per share in AT T
stock. The stock portion will be subject to a collar such that Time Warner stockholders will receive 1.437 AT T shares if AT T s stock price is below $37.411 at closing and 1.300 AT T shares if AT T s stock price is above
$41.349 at closing. If AT T s stock price at closing is between $37.411 and $41.349, Time Warner stockholders will receive a number of shares between 1.300 and 1.437, equal to $53.75 in value. The merger is subject to approval by Time
Warner stockholders and the receipt of certain antitrust and other regulatory consents. The transaction is expected to close before year-end 2017. Should Time Warner terminate the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, including in order to
consummate a competing transaction, Time Warner will be required to pay AT T a termination fee equal to $1.725 billion.  
 In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Company granted a total of 4.8 million special retention
restricted stock units ( Special Retention RSUs ) to certain employees of Time Warner and its divisions, including all executive officers of Time Warner other than its Chairman and CEO, on October 24, 2016. Half of the Special
Retention RSUs will vest 25% per year on each of the first four anniversaries of February 15, 2017, and the remaining half will vest 25% per year on each of the first four anniversaries of February 15, 2018. Pursuant to the
Special Retention RSU agreements, vesting as a result of retirement is not permitted unless the employee retires after the merger has closed. In addition, the awards do not accelerate automatically following the closing of the merger. Instead,
the employee must remain employed following the closing, and the awards will vest only upon the scheduled vesting date or upon termination of employment under certain circumstances, such as termination without cause, for good reason or due to
retirement.    In addition, certain employees of Time Warner and its divisions, including executive officers other than the
Chairman and CEO, have received or will receive a cash retention award. Half of the award will become payable upon the closing of the merger, and the remaining half will become payable six months thereafter, in both cases, subject to continued
employment on the relevant payment date. Payment will also be made upon termination without cause or for good reason.      Strategic Review
     As part of its long-range planning process, the Company routinely reviews opportunities to streamline its
operations and optimize its programming. In connection with that review, the Company will evaluate its future use of certain owned and licensed programming rights and could incur charges of approximately $60 million to $80 million in the fourth
quarter of 2016.      Time Warner Pension Plan Amendment    
 On August 1, 2016, the Time Warner Pension Plan (the  Pension Plan ) was amended to provide for a one-time lump
sum window program for eligible vested participants who (i) had terminated employment as of May 31, 2016, (ii) had not yet commenced payment of their benefits as of May 31, 2016, (iii) are not otherwise eligible for an
immediate lump sum payment of their benefits and (iv) have benefits with a present value of less than $50,000. Eligible participants had the opportunity to elect, during the period beginning on August 16, 2016 and ending on October 7,
2016, to receive their benefits in the form of an immediate lump sum payment. Certain annuity options were also available. Payments to those eligible participants who elected to receive their benefit under the window program will be made or commence
as of December 2016. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company expects to recognize settlement losses of approximately $55 million to $70 million in connection with this amendment to the Pension Plan, the majority of which
will be related to businesses the Company has previously disposed of.      Hulu    
 On August 2, 2016, Time Warner purchased a 10% ownership interest in Hulu, LLC, a company that provides OTT video
services, for $590 million in cash, including transaction costs. Time Warner accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting.

    2016 Debt Offering    
 On May 10, 2016, Time Warner issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% Notes due 2026 under a shelf
registration statement. See  Financial Condition and Liquidity   Outstanding Debt and Other Financing Arrangements  for further information.  
   NCAA      On
March 14, 2016, Turner and CBS entered into an agreement with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (the  NCAA ) to license the television, digital and marketing rights to the NCAA Division I Men s Basketball Championship
Tournament (the  NCAA Tournament ) from 2025 through 2032 for an aggregate rights fee of $8.8 billion. While the aggregate rights fee will be paid by Turner to the NCAA, the rights fee, production costs, advertising revenues and
sponsorship revenues related to the NCAA Tournament and related programming will continue to be shared by Turner and CBS. Annually, for 2025 through 2032, Turner will be allocated the first $90 million of revenue subject to the
arrangement. However, if the amount paid for the rights fee and production costs in any year during that period exceeds advertising and sponsorship revenues for that year, including the $90 million of revenue allocated to Turner, CBS 
share of such shortfall will be limited to $45 million. Under the existing agreement among Turner, CBS and the NCAA, Turner and CBS have licensed rights to the NCAA Tournament through 2024.  
   Fandango      In
April 2016, Warner Bros. sold its Flixster business to Fandango Media, LLC ( Fandango ), a subsidiary of NBCUniversal Media LLC, in exchange for a 25% interest in Fandango. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Warner
Bros. recorded a pre-tax gain of $90 million in connection with this transaction.      Central European Media Enterprises Ltd.    
 On February 19, 2016, CME Media Enterprises B.V. ( CME BV ), a subsidiary of Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. ( CME ), entered into a credit agreement (the  2016 Credit Agreement ) with third-party financial institutions for an approximate  470 million senior unsecured term loan (the  2016 Term Loan ) that was
funded in April 2016 and matures on February 19, 2021. Time Warner has guaranteed CME BV s obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement for a fee equal to a rate based on CME s net leverage, which initially was 10.5%, less the interest
rate on the 2016 Term Loan, which initially was approximately 1.78%, to be paid to Time Warner semi-annually. CME BV must pay a portion of the fee in cash and may, at CME BV s option, pay the remainder in cash or in kind. In April 2016, CME
used cash on hand and the proceeds of the 2016 Term Loan to repay in their entirety both its Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the  Senior Secured Notes ) and the term loan Time Warner provided CME in 2014 (the  TW Term Loan ),
which also was due in 2017. Time Warner received approximately $485 million in connection with CME s repayment of the Senior Secured Notes and the TW Term Loan. As consideration for assisting CME in refinancing its debt due in 2017, Time
Warner earned a fee equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Term Loan borrowed at funding. Prior to the funding, CME BV entered into unsecured interest rate hedge arrangements to protect against changes in the interest rate on the
2016 Term Loan during its term, and Time Warner has guaranteed CME BV s obligations under such arrangements.    In
addition, on February 19, 2016, CME entered into an amendment to extend the maturity of its  251 million senior unsecured term loan obtained in 2014 from third-party financial institutions (the  2014 Term Loan ) from
November 1, 2017 to November 1, 2018. Time Warner continues to guarantee CME s obligations under the 2014 Term Loan.  
 Time Warner and CME also agreed on February 19, 2016 to amend and restate the $115 million revolving credit facility Time
Warner provided CME in 2014 to reduce the size of the facility to $50 million as of January 1, 2018 and to extend its term from December 2017 to February 2021. Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate
based on CME s net leverage. Beginning in April 2016, CME must pay a portion of the interest for each applicable quarterly interest period in cash and may, at CME s option, pay the remainder in kind by adding such amount to the outstanding
principal amount of the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  
 The Company recorded a pretax gain of $95 million in Investment gains (losses), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement
of Operations in the second quarter of 2016 in connection with these transactions. Additionally, when recognizing CME s results in the second quarter of 2016 under the equity method of accounting, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $150
million in Other loss, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations related to these transactions.

    Revenues.     The components of Revenues are as
follows (millions):      
   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Revenues at the Turner segment
increased primarily driven by higher Subscription and Advertising revenues. Revenues at the Home Box Office segment increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to higher Subscription revenues. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, Revenues increased at the Warner Bros. segment driven by higher Theatrical product revenues, partially offset by lower Videogames and other revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Revenues at the Warner
Bros. segment decreased primarily due to lower Videogames and other revenues. Changes in exchange rates associated with the foreign currencies to which the Company is exposed negatively impacted the Company s Revenues by approximately $55
million and $230 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, with negative impacts of approximately $25 million and $120 million,
respectively, at the Turner segment, $30 million and $100 million, respectively, at the Warner Bros. segment and $0 and $10 million, respectively, at the Home Box Office segment. If the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar remain
at the levels they were at as of September 30, 2016 or if the U.S. Dollar strengthens further in 2016 relative to the foreign currencies to which the Company is exposed, the Company s Revenues in 2016 will be negatively affected as
compared to its Revenues in 2015. Each of the revenue categories is discussed in greater detail by segment in  Business Segment Results.   
   Costs of Revenues.     For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Costs of
revenues were $3.873 billion and $11.718 billion, respectively, as compared to $3.526 billion and $11.802 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in Costs of revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 reflected increases across all of the segments. The decrease in Costs of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflected a decrease at the Warner Bros. segment, partially offset by increases at the Turner
and Home Box Office segments. The segment variations are discussed in  Business Segment Results.       
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $1.179 billion from $1.143 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily reflecting an increase at Corporate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $3.688 billion from $3.580 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily reflecting increases at the Turner segment and Corporate, partially offset by a decline at
the Warner Bros. segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Selling, general and administrative expenses included a $22 million foreign currency charge related to a change in the foreign currency exchange rate used by the Company
for remeasuring its Venezuelan net monetary assets from the SICAD 2 rate to the Simadi rate. The segment variations are discussed in  Business Segment Results.       
 Included in Costs of revenues and Selling, general and administrative expenses is depreciation expense of $118 million and
$359 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $120 million and $363 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
   Amortization Expense.     Amortization expense was $48 million and $143 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $47 million and $138 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

     Operating Income.    Operating Income increased to $2.014 billion for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.834 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the items noted under  Transactions and Other Items Affecting Comparability  totaling $56 million and $8
million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Operating Income increased $228 million, primarily reflecting an increase at the Turner segment.  
 Operating Income increased to $5.856 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.479 billion for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the items noted under  Transactions and Other Items Affecting Comparability  totaling $14 million of income and $39 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, Operating Income increased $324 million, primarily reflecting an increase at the Turner segment.  
   Interest Expense, Net.    Interest expense, net detail is shown in the table below (millions):

Net.    Other loss, net detail is shown in the table below (millions):      
   Investment gains (losses), net, premiums paid and costs incurred on debt redemption and
amounts related to the separations of TWC and Time Inc. and the disposition of WMG are discussed under  Transactions and Other Items Affecting Comparability.  The increase in loss from equity method investees for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was mainly due to the Company s share of losses from CME primarily related to the 2016 CME financing transactions.

the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decreases in the effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily due to a change in the Company s tax method of
accounting for film and television cost amortization that was approved by the Internal Revenue Service during the third quarter of 2016. The change in method generated a tax benefit related to extra-territorial income exclusions for tax years
dating back to 2001.      Income from Continuing Operations.    Income from continuing operations was
$1.472 billion and $1.034 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the items noted under  Transactions and Other Items Affecting Comparability  totaling $29 million and $6 million of

 Domestic subscription revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $160 million and $462
million, respectively, primarily due to higher contractual rates, partially offset by a decrease in subscribers. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, international subscription revenues increased $3 million and decreased $14
million, respectively, as growth mainly in Latin America was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $15 million and $70 million, respectively.  
 The increase in Advertising revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflected domestic growth of $15
million primarily driven by Turner s news business, mainly due to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election coverage, partially offset by lower audience delivery at certain entertainment networks. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the increase in Advertising revenues reflected domestic growth of $160 million primarily driven by Turner s news business, mainly due to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election coverage, as well as the 2016 NCAA Tournament, partially offset by
lower audience delivery at certain entertainment networks. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, international advertising revenues increased $1 million and decreased $15 million, respectively, as growth mainly in Latin
America was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $10 million and $40 million, respectively.  
 The increase in Content and other revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to higher

(millions):      

(a) 
   Costs of revenues exclude depreciation.     
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, programming costs increased mainly due to the 2016 U.S.
Presidential election coverage and also, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, higher costs for sports programming. The increase in other direct operating costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily
related to costs associated with Turner s and Warner Bros.  strategic partnership to grow their global kids businesses.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to
higher marketing expense for new original series.    Refer to  Transactions and Other Items Affecting
Comparability  for a discussion of Gain (loss) on operating assets, Asset impairments, Venezuelan foreign currency loss and external costs related to mergers, acquisitions and dispositions for the three and nine months ended September 30,

  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the increase in
Subscription revenues was driven by higher domestic subscription revenues of $51 million and $167 million, respectively, primarily due to higher contractual rates.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Content and other revenues increased primarily due to higher licensing
revenues of $42 million, partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues of $32 million.    The components of Costs of
revenues for the Home Box Office segment are as follows (millions):      

(a) 
   Costs of revenues exclude depreciation.     
 During the second quarter of 2016, the Home Box Office segment revised its estimate of the period over which its original
programming is utilized by its subscribers. The updated estimate gives consideration to Home Box Office s original programming history and was driven by consumer viewing patterns, which are influenced by the increased availability of and
on-demand access to Home Box Office s content across a wide variety of devices and services, including HBO NOW, which launched in April 2015. As a result, in determining amortization under the film forecast computation method, the weighted
average subscriber utilization period for the majority of Home Box Office s original programming was increased by approximately five months. This change resulted in a reduction of amortization expense, as compared to the amount determined
using Home Box Office s previous estimate, of approximately $35 million and $130 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
 The increase in originals and sports programming costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
primarily due to higher original programming expenses, partially offset by the impact of the change in the estimate of the utilization period of its original programming described in the preceding paragraph. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the higher original programming expenses also included higher original programming charges. The increase in acquired films and syndicated series programming costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
primarily related to acquired programming for both HBO s domestic and international businesses.    For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower marketing expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat primarily
due to $9 million of expenses related to Home Box Office s withdrawal from a multiemployer benefit plan, partially offset by lower marketing expenses.  
 The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $41 million of Restructuring and severance costs
principally related to executive severance costs.    The increase in Operating Income for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was primarily due to higher Revenues, partially offset by higher Costs of revenues and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, higher Restructuring and severance costs.

sixteen and fifteen home video and electronic delivery releases in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 The decrease in theatrical product revenues from television licensing for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was
primarily due to lower international license fees. The increase in theatrical product revenues from television licensing for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to higher international license fees.  
 The decrease in television product revenues from television licensing for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the timing and mix of availabilities, partially offset by higher initial telecast revenues.  
 Videogames and other revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to lower revenues of
$166 million from releases during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 and lower carryover revenues of $111 million from prior period releases. Videogames and other revenues decreased for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 primarily due to lower revenues of $715 million from releases during the first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared to first nine months of 2015, partially offset by higher carryover revenues of $127 million from prior
period releases. The Company released three and two videogames in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and eight and twelve videogames in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 The components of Costs of revenues for the Warner Bros. segment are as follows (millions):  

(a) 
   Costs of revenues excludes depreciation.     
 Included in film and television production costs are production costs related to videogames, as well as theatrical film and
videogame valuation adjustments resulting primarily from revisions to estimates of ultimate revenue and/or costs for certain theatrical films and videogames. Theatrical film valuation adjustments were $1 million and $74 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Videogame valuation adjustments were $4 million and $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in film and television production costs for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of higher revenues for theatrical product. The decrease in film and television production

costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to lower costs for videogames, partially offset by higher costs for television and theatrical product. The increase in
print and advertising costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the type of theatrical and videogames releases. The decrease in print and advertising costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
primarily due to the type and number of theatrical, home entertainment and videogames releases. Other costs, including merchandise and related costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to lower
distribution-related costs of sales primarily as a result of lower revenues for videogames and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, lower revenues for home entertainment.  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses was essentially flat for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily
due to higher third party distribution fees, mainly as a result of higher theatrical product revenues, partially offset by lower bad debt expense of $16 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 mainly due to lower bad debt expense of $23 million, lower third party distribution fees of $14 million and cost savings initiatives.

impairments, Venezuelan foreign currency loss and external costs related to mergers, acquisitions and dispositions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which affected the comparability of the Warner Bros.
segment s results.    The increase in Operating Income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily
due to higher Revenues, partially offset by higher Costs of revenues. The increase in Operating Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to lower Costs of revenues, a Gain on operating assets and lower Selling,
general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower Revenues.

 Refer to  Transactions and Other Items Affecting Comparability  for a discussion of Asset impairments, pension
settlements and external costs related to mergers, acquisitions and dispositions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which affected the comparability of Corporate s results.  
 Operating loss increased primarily due to higher equity-based compensation expense of $24 million and $34 million for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which mainly reflected higher expenses for performance stock units due to an increase in the Company s stock price, $10 million of pension settlement charges for both the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, higher costs of $14 million related to enterprise efficiency initiatives primarily focused on technology.  
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

1.  
    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION      
  Description of Business   
 Time Warner Inc. ( Time Warner  or the  Company ) is a leading media and entertainment company, whose
businesses include television networks, and film and TV entertainment. Time Warner classifies its operations into three reportable segments:  Turner : consisting principally of cable networks and digital media properties;  Home Box
Office : consisting principally of premium pay television and over-the-top ( OTT ) services domestically and premium pay, basic tier television and OTT services internationally; and  Warner Bros. : consisting principally of
television, feature film, home video and videogame production and distribution.     Basis of Presentation   
   Interim Financial Statements    
 The consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, they contain all the adjustments
(consisting of those of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) applicable to interim periods. The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of Time Warner included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ).      Basis of Consolidation    
 The consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of entities in
which Time Warner has a controlling interest ( subsidiaries ). Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation.  
   Reclassifications    
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial information to conform to the September 30, 2016
presentation.      Use of Estimates    
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
 Significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include accounting
for asset impairments, multiple-element transactions, allowances for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, the determination of ultimate revenues as it relates to amortization or impairment of capitalized film and programming costs and
participations and residuals, home video and videogame product returns, business combinations, pension and other postretirement benefits, equity-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies, litigation matters, reporting revenue for certain
transactions on a gross versus net basis, and the determination of whether the Company should consolidate certain entities.     Venezuela Currency
    During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company recognized a pretax foreign exchange loss of $22 million in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to a change in the foreign currency exchange rate the Company used to remeasure its Venezuelan net monetary assets from the SICAD 2 rate to the Simadi rate. Approximately $15 million of such loss
related to cash balances.

TIME WARNER INC.   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)       
   Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2016   
   Equity Method of Accounting    
 In March 2016, guidance was issued that changes the requirements for equity method accounting when an investment qualifies for
use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the investor s ownership interest in or degree of influence over an investee. The guidance (i) eliminates the need to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting upon
qualifying for such treatment, (ii) requires that the cost of acquiring the additional interest in an investee be added to the basis of the previously held interest and (iii) requires that unrealized holding gains or losses for
available-for-sale equity securities that qualify for the equity method of accounting be recognized in earnings at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method of accounting. The Company adopted this guidance on
January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and it did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.     Accounting Guidance Not Yet
Adopted       Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    
 In August 2016, guidance was issued that clarifies the presentation of certain cash receipts and payments in a company s
statement of cash flows. The guidance primarily relates to the classification of cash flows associated with certain (i) debt transactions, (ii) contingent consideration arrangements related to business combinations, (iii) insurance
claims and policies, (iv) distributions received from equity method investees and (v) securitization transactions. The guidance will become effective on a retrospective basis for the Company on January 1, 2018, although early adoption
is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.      Share-Based Payments
     In March 2016, guidance was issued that changes the reporting for certain aspects of share-based payments. One
aspect of the guidance, which will become effective on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2017, requires that the income tax effects of share-based awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are
settled. Under the current guidance, excess tax benefits and deficiencies have been recognized in Additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the amount of excess tax benefits,
net of deficiencies, recognized in Additional paid-in capital was $150 million. Another aspect of the new guidance, which the Company will adopt on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2017, requires that excess tax benefits be
classified as a cash flow from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Under the current guidance, excess tax benefits have been classified as a cash flow from financing activities. Excess tax benefits presented as a
cash flow from financing activities were $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The other aspects of this new guidance are not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
   Accounting for Leases    
 In February 2016, guidance was issued regarding accounting for leases. The main difference between the current guidance and
the new guidance is the recognition by a lessee of lease assets and liabilities for those leases it classified as operating leases under the current guidance. Under the new guidance, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash
flows arising from a lease as well as the lessor accounting model have not significantly changed from current guidance. This guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. The new
guidance will become effective on a modified retrospective basis for the Company on January 1, 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities    
 In January 2016, guidance was issued that makes limited changes to the accounting for financial instruments. The changes
primarily relate to (i) the requirement to measure equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings,
(ii) an alternative approach for the measurement of equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, (iii) the elimination of the other-than-temporary impairment model and its replacement with a requirement to perform
a qualitative assessment to identify the impairment of equity investments, and a requirement to recognize impairment losses in earnings based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the equity investment, (iv) the
elimination of the requirement to disclose the methods and  
      30  

Table of Contents  

TIME WARNER INC.   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)       
  
significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost, (v) the addition of a requirement to use the exit price concept when measuring
the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and (vi) the addition of a requirement to present financial assets and financial liabilities separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category
(e.g., fair value, amortized cost, lower of cost or market) and by form of financial asset (e.g., loans, securities). This guidance will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the new guidance to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.      Revenue Recognition    
 In May 2014, guidance was issued that establishes a new revenue recognition framework in GAAP for all companies and
industries. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue from the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive for those goods or

    MERGER AGREEMENT WITH AT T INC.      
 On October 22, 2016, Time Warner entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with
AT T Inc. ( AT T ). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of AT T with and into Time Warner, with Time Warner continuing as the surviving company in the merger. Immediately
thereafter, Time Warner will merge with and into a limited liability company formed by AT T, which will continue as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of AT T. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by all members of
Time Warner s and AT T s board of directors.    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of the Company s common stock, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive $53.75 in cash plus a number of shares of
AT T common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio is determined as follows:      

If the Average AT T Stock Price (as defined below) is an amount greater than $41.349, the Exchange Ratio
will be 1.300;         

If the Average AT T Stock Price is an amount greater than or equal to $37.411 but less than or equal to
$41.349, the Exchange Ratio will be an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $53.75 by (y) the Average AT T Stock Price; or         
    Average AT T Stock Price  means the average of the volume weighted averages of the
trading prices of AT T Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on each of the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that is three trading days prior to the date of the effective time of the merger.  
 The transaction is expected to close before year-end 2017. Consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions,
including, among others, customary conditions relating to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of the Time Warner stockholders and the receipt of certain antitrust and other regulatory approvals. Should Time Warner terminate
the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, including in order to consummate a competing transaction, Time Warner will be required to pay AT T a termination fee equal to $1.725 billion.

   Recent Transactions   
 On February 19, 2016, CME Media Enterprises B.V. ( CME BV ), a subsidiary of Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. ( CME ), entered into a credit agreement (the  2016 Credit Agreement ) with third-party financial institutions for an approximate  470 million senior unsecured term loan (the  2016 Term Loan ) that was
funded in April 2016 and matures on February 19, 2021. Time Warner has guaranteed CME BV s obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement for a fee equal to a rate based on CME s net leverage, which initially was 10.5%, less the interest
rate on the 2016 Term Loan, which initially was 1.78%, to be paid to Time Warner semi-annually. CME BV must pay a portion of the fee in cash and may, at CME BV s option, pay the remainder in cash or in kind. In April 2016, CME used cash on hand
and the proceeds of the 2016 Term Loan to repay in their entirety both its Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the  Senior Secured Notes ) and the term loan Time Warner provided CME in 2014 (the  TW Term Loan ), which also was due in
2017. Time Warner received approximately $485 million in connection with CME s repayment of the Senior Secured Notes and the TW Term Loan. As consideration for assisting CME in refinancing its debt due in 2017, Time Warner earned a fee equal to
1% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Term Loan borrowed at funding. Prior to the funding, CME BV entered into unsecured interest rate hedge arrangements to protect against changes in the interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan during its
term, and Time Warner has guaranteed CME BV s obligations under such arrangements.    In addition, on February 19,
2016, CME entered into an amendment to extend the maturity of its  251 million senior unsecured term loan obtained in 2014 from third-party financial institutions (the  2014 Term Loan ) from November 1, 2017 to
November 1, 2018. Time Warner continues to guarantee CME s obligations under the 2014 Term Loan.    Time Warner
and CME also agreed on February 19, 2016 to amend and restate the $115 million revolving credit facility Time Warner provided CME in 2014 to reduce the size of the facility to $50 million as of January 1, 2018 and to extend its term from
December 2017 to February 2021. Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate based on CME s net leverage. Beginning in April 2016, CME must pay a portion of the interest for each applicable quarterly interest
period in cash and may, at CME s option, pay the remainder in kind by adding such amount to the outstanding principal amount of the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving
credit facility.    The Company recorded a pretax gain of $95 million in Investment gains (losses), net in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations in the second quarter of 2016 in connection with these transactions. Additionally, when recognizing CME s results in the second quarter of 2016 under the equity method of accounting, the Company recorded a pretax charge
of $150 million in Other loss, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to these transactions.

    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS      
 A fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or
liability. A three-tiered hierarchy draws distinctions between market participant assumptions based on (i) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), (ii) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are
observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and (iii) unobservable inputs that require the Company to use present value and other valuation techniques in the determination of fair value (Level 3). The following table presents information
about assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively (millions):      

(a) 
   Consists of investments related to deferred compensation.     
 The Company primarily applies the market approach for valuing recurring fair value measurements. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, assets valued using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) primarily related to warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock of CME valued at $135 million and $179 million, respectively. The Company
estimates the fair value of these warrants using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement at September 30, 2016 are an expected term of 0.96 years and an expected volatility of
approximately 57%. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the other Level 3 assets consisted of equity instruments held by employees of a former subsidiary of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, Level 3 liabilities
consisted of liabilities for contingent consideration and options to redeem securities.

  The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of net
derivative assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 and identifies the total gains (losses) the Company recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 on such assets and liabilities that were included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 (millions):      
    Other Financial Instruments   
 The Company s other financial instruments, including debt, are not required to be carried at fair value. Based on the
interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2016, the fair value of Time Warner s debt exceeded its carrying value by approximately $5.056 billion and, based on interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2015, the fair value of Time
Warner s debt exceeded its carrying value by approximately $2.490 billion. The fair value of Time Warner s debt is considered a Level 2 measurement as it is based on observable market inputs such as current interest rates and, where
available, actual sales transactions. Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not result in the realization or expenditure of cash and generally are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements unless the debt is retired prior to its
maturity.    Information as of September 30, 2016 about the Company s investments in CME that are not required to
be carried at fair value on a recurring basis is as follows (millions):

(a) 
   Includes 1 share of Series A convertible preferred stock.     
 The fair values of the Company s investments in CME s Class A common stock (including Series A convertible
preferred stock) and Series B convertible redeemable preferred shares are primarily determined by reference to the September 30, 2016 closing price of CME s common stock.  
 The carrying value for the majority of the Company s other financial instruments approximates fair value due to the
short-term nature of the financial instruments or because the financial instruments are of a longer-term nature and are recorded on a discounted basis.  
  Non-Financial Instruments   
 The majority of the Company s non-financial instruments, which include goodwill, intangible assets, inventories and
property, plant and equipment, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if certain triggering events occur (or at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), a non-financial instrument is
required to be evaluated for impairment. If the Company determines that the non-financial instrument is impaired, the Company would be required to write down the non-financial instrument to its fair value.

  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
performed an impairment review of a broadcast license at an international subsidiary of Turner. As a result, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a noncash impairment of $25 million to write down the
value of the asset to $10 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company performed an impairment review of certain intangible assets at an international subsidiary of Turner. As a result, during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a noncash impairment of $1 million to completely write off the value of these assets. The resulting fair value measurements were considered to be Level 3 measurements and were
determined using a discounted cash flow ( DCF ) methodology with assumptions for cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposition of the assets.  
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company also performed fair
value measurements related to certain theatrical films and television programs. In determining the fair value of its theatrical films, the Company employs a DCF methodology that includes cash flow estimates of a film s ultimate revenue and
costs as well as a discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the DCF analysis is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the respective business (e.g., Warner Bros.) plus a risk premium representing the risk associated with producing a
particular theatrical film. The fair value of any theatrical films and television programs that management plans to abandon is zero. Because the primary determination of fair value is made using a DCF model, the resulting fair value is considered a
Level 3 measurement. The following table presents certain theatrical film and television production costs, which were recorded as inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, that were written down to fair value (millions):

7.  
    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES      
 Time Warner uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, to manage the risk associated with the volatility of
future cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and changes in fair value resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The principal currencies being hedged include the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.
Time Warner uses foreign exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three to 18 months to hedge various foreign exchange exposures, including the following: (i) variability in foreign-currency-denominated cash flows, such as the
hedges of unremitted or forecasted royalty and license fees owed to Time Warner s domestic companies for the sale or anticipated sale of U.S. copyrighted products abroad or cash flows for certain film production costs denominated in a foreign
currency (i.e., cash flow hedges), and (ii) currency risk associated with foreign-currency-denominated operating assets and liabilities (i.e., fair value hedges).  
 The Company also enters into derivative contracts that economically hedge certain of its foreign currency risks, even though
hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. These economic hedges are used primarily to offset the change in certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term receivables and certain foreign-currency-denominated
intercompany debt due to changes in the underlying foreign exchange rates.    The translation of revenues and expenses
denominated in the functional currency of a foreign subsidiary may result in fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar-equivalent value of such revenues and expenses as compared to prior periods. Such transactions are not eligible for qualifying hedge
accounting treatment, and the Company does not economically hedge this exposure.

  Net gains and losses from hedging activities recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations were as follows (millions):      
   Amounts included in Other loss, net include the impact of forward points and option premiums,
which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Other amounts included in Other loss, net relate to hedges of foreign-currency-denominated debt and hedge ineffectiveness, which are not material.  
 The Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are party to its financial
transactions and has entered into collateral agreements with these counterparties to further protect the Company in the event of deterioration of the credit quality of such counterparties on outstanding transactions. Additionally, netting provisions
are included in agreements in situations where the Company executes multiple contracts with the same counterparty. For such foreign exchange contracts, the Company offsets the fair values of the amounts owed to or due from the same counterparty and
classifies the net amount as a net asset or net liability within Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following is a summary of amounts recorded
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet pertaining to Time Warner s use of foreign currency derivatives at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (millions):      

(a) 
   Includes $207 million ($195 million of qualifying hedges and $12 million of economic hedges) and $169 million
($164 million of qualifying hedges and $5 million of economic hedges) of foreign exchange derivative contracts in asset and liability positions, respectively.     

(b) 
   Includes $198 million ($194 million of qualifying hedges and $4 million of economic hedges) and $121 million
($116 million of qualifying hedges and $5 million of economic hedges) of foreign exchange derivative contracts in asset and liability positions, respectively.     
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $14 million of losses and $29 million of gains, respectively, related
to cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net and are expected to be recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. Included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are net losses of $2 million and $9 million, respectively, related to hedges of cash flows associated with films that are not expected to be released within the next twelve months.  
 At September 30, 2016, the carrying amount of the Company s  700 million aggregate principal amount of
debt due 2023 is designated as a hedge of the variability in the Company s Euro-denominated net investments. The gain or loss on the debt that is designated as, and is effective as, an economic hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation
is recorded as a currency translation adjustment within Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, such amounts totaled $0 and $17 million of losses,
respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, such amounts totaled $21 million of losses.

    SEGMENT INFORMATION      
 Time Warner classifies its operations into three reportable segments:  Turner : consisting principally of cable networks
and digital media properties;  Home Box Office : consisting principally of premium pay television and OTT services domestically and premium pay, basic tier television and OTT services internationally; and  Warner Bros. : consisting
principally of television, feature film, home video and videogame production and distribution. Time Warner s reportable segments have been determined in accordance with its internal management structure and the financial information that is
evaluated regularly by the Company s chief operating decision maker.    In the ordinary course of business, Time
Warner s reportable segments enter into transactions with one another. The most common types of intersegment transactions include the Warner Bros. segment generating revenues by licensing television and theatrical programming to the Turner
and Home Box Office segments. While intersegment transactions are treated like third-party transactions to determine segment performance, the revenues (and corresponding expenses or assets recognized by the segment that is the counterparty to the
transaction) are eliminated in consolidation and, therefore, do not affect consolidated results.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      
  Commitments       Six Flags    
 In connection with the Company s former investment in the Six Flags theme parks located in Georgia and Texas
(collectively, the  Parks ), in 1997, certain subsidiaries of the Company (including Historic TW and, in connection with the separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. in 2009, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) agreed to guarantee (the  Six
Flags Guarantee ) certain obligations of the partnerships that hold the Parks (the  Partnerships ) for the benefit of the limited partners in such Partnerships, including: annual payments made at the Parks or to the limited partners
and additional obligations at the end of the respective terms for the Partnerships in 2027 and 2028 (the  Guaranteed Obligations ). The aggregate undiscounted estimated future cash flow requirements covered by the Six Flags Guarantee over
the remaining term (through 2028) are $895 million (for a net present value of $435 million). To date, no payments have been made by the Company pursuant to the Six Flags Guarantee.  
 Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (formerly known as Six Flags, Inc. and Premier Parks Inc.) ( Six Flags ), which
has the controlling interest in the Parks, has agreed, pursuant to a subordinated indemnity agreement (the  Subordinated Indemnity Agreement ), to guarantee the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations when due and to indemnify Historic
TW, among others, if the Six Flags Guarantee is called upon. If Six Flags defaults in its indemnification obligations, Historic TW has the right to acquire control of the managing partner of the Parks. Six Flags  obligations to Historic TW are
further secured by its interest in all limited partnership units held by Six Flags.    Because the Six Flags Guarantee
existed prior to December 31, 2002 and no modifications to the arrangements have been made since the date the guarantee came into existence, the Company is required to continue to account for the Guaranteed Obligations as a contingent
liability. Based on its evaluation of the current facts and circumstances surrounding the Guaranteed Obligations and the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement, the Company is unable to predict the loss, if any, that may be incurred under the Guaranteed
Obligations, and no liability for the arrangements has been recognized at September 30, 2016. Because of the specific circumstances surrounding the arrangements and the fact that no active or observable market exists for this type of financial
guarantee, the Company is unable to determine a current fair value for the Guaranteed Obligations and related Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.  
  Contingencies     In the
ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in or parties to various legal claims, actions and proceedings. These claims, actions and proceedings are at varying stages of investigation, arbitration or adjudication,
and involve a variety of areas of law.    On April 4, 2007, the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB )
issued a complaint against CNN America Inc. ( CNN America ) and Team Video Services, LLC ( Team Video ) related to CNN America s December 2003 and January 2004 terminations of its contractual relationships with Team Video,
under which Team Video had provided electronic news gathering services in Washington, DC and New York, NY. The National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, under which Team Video s employees were unionized, initially filed
charges of unfair labor practices with the NLRB in February 2004, alleging that CNN America and Team Video were joint employers, that CNN America was a successor employer to Team Video, and/or that CNN America discriminated in its hiring practices
to avoid becoming a successor employer or due to specific individuals  union affiliation or activities. In the complaint, the NLRB sought, among other things, the reinstatement of certain union members and monetary damages. On November 19,
2008, the presiding NLRB Administrative Law Judge ( ALJ ) issued a non-binding recommended decision and order finding CNN America liable. On September 15, 2014, a three-member panel of the NLRB affirmed the ALJ s decision and
adopted the ALJ s order with certain modifications. On November 12, 2014, both CNN America and the NLRB General Counsel filed motions with the NLRB for reconsideration of the panel s decision. On March 20, 2015, the NLRB granted
the NLRB General Counsel s motion for reconsideration to correct certain inadvertent errors in the panel s decision, and it denied CNN America s motion for reconsideration. On July 9, 2015, CNN America filed a notice of appeal
with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit regarding the panel s decision and the denial of CNN America s motion for reconsideration.  
 The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when the Company determines that a loss is both probable and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has
been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters.

TIME WARNER INC.   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)       
  The Company has estimated a range of possible loss for legal claims for which
the Company has determined a loss is probable or reasonably possible, including the matter disclosed above. The Company believes the estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss for such matters in excess of accrued liabilities is between $0 and
$100 million at September 30, 2016. The estimated aggregate range of possible loss is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions. The matters represented in the estimated aggregate range of possible loss will change from time
to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.    In view of the inherent difficulty of
predicting the outcome of litigation and claims, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or
penalties related to each pending matter may be. An adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Company s results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.  
   Income Tax Uncertainties    
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded net decreases to income tax reserves of
approximately $55 million. During this period, the Company recorded increases to income tax reserves of approximately $95 million that increased the effective tax rate for continuing operations as well as decreases of approximately $40 million
related to discontinued foreign operations. In addition, during this period, the Company recorded net increases to interest reserves related to the income tax reserves of approximately $35 million.  
 In the Company s judgment, uncertainties related to certain tax matters are reasonably possible of being resolved during
the next twelve months. The effect of such resolution, which could vary based on the final terms and timing of actual settlements with taxing authorities, is estimated to be a reduction of recorded unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to
$15 million, most of which would decrease the Company s effective tax rate.      

16.  
    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      
 The Company has entered into certain transactions in the ordinary course of business with unconsolidated investees accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. The transactions that generate revenue and expenses primarily relate to the licensing by the Warner Bros. segment of content to The CW broadcast network, Hulu, and certain international networks, including
networks owned by CME. Transactions that generate interest income and other income primarily relate to financing transactions with CME. Amounts included in the consolidated financial statements resulting from transactions with related parties
consist of (millions):

    Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements   
 The Company s collaborative arrangements primarily relate to arrangements entered into with third parties to jointly
finance and distribute theatrical productions and an arrangement entered into with CBS Broadcasting, Inc. ( CBS ) and The National Collegiate Athletic Association (the  NCAA ).  
 For the Company s collaborative arrangements entered into with third parties to jointly finance and distribute theatrical
productions, net participation costs of $74 million were recorded in Costs of revenues for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $192 million and $322 million were recorded in Costs of revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    The arrangement among Turner, CBS and the NCAA provides Turner and CBS
with rights to the NCAA Division I Men s Basketball Championship Tournament (the  NCAA Tournament ) in the United States and its territories and possessions through 2032. The aggregate rights fee, production costs, advertising
revenues and sponsorship revenues related to the NCAA Tournament and related programming are shared by Turner and CBS. However, if the amount paid for the rights fee and production costs, in any given year, exceeds advertising and sponsorship
revenues for that year, CBS  share of such shortfall is limited to specified annual amounts, ranging from approximately $30 million to $45 million.

  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION   
  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  Overview     Set forth
below are condensed consolidating financial statements presenting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of (i) Time Warner Inc. (the  Parent Company ), (ii) Historic TW Inc. (in its own capacity and as
successor by merger to Time Warner Companies, Inc.), Home Box Office, Inc., and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., each a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company (collectively, the  Guarantor Subsidiaries ), on a combined basis,
(iii) the direct and indirect non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Company (the  Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries ), on a combined basis, and (iv) the eliminations necessary to arrive at the information for Time Warner Inc. on a
consolidated basis. The Guarantor Subsidiaries fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally guarantee securities issued under certain of the Company s indentures on an unsecured basis.  
 There are no legal or regulatory restrictions on the Parent Company s ability to obtain funds from any of its wholly
owned subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances.     Basis of Presentation   
 In presenting the condensed consolidating financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to
(i) the Parent Company s interests in the Guarantor Subsidiaries and (ii) the Guarantor Subsidiaries  interests in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, where applicable, even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be
consolidated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All intercompany balances and transactions between the Parent Company, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries have been eliminated, as shown in the column
 Eliminations.     The Parent Company s accounting bases in all subsidiaries, including goodwill and
identified intangible assets, have been  pushed down  to the applicable subsidiaries. Corporate overhead expenses have been reflected as expenses of the Parent Company and have not been allocated to the Guarantor Subsidiaries or the
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Interest income (expense) is determined based on outstanding debt and the relevant intercompany amounts at the respective subsidiary.  
 All direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries are included in Time Warner Inc. s consolidated U.S. tax return. In the
condensed consolidating financial statements, tax provision has been allocated based on each such subsidiary s relative pretax income to the consolidated pretax income. With respect to the use of certain consolidated tax attributes (principally
operating and capital loss carryforwards), such benefits have been allocated to the respective subsidiary that generated the taxable income permitting such use (i.e., pro-rata based on where the income was generated). For example, to the extent a
Non-Guarantor Subsidiary generated a gain on the sale of a business for which the Parent Company utilized tax attributes to offset such gain, the tax attribute benefit would be allocated to that Non-Guarantor Subsidiary. Deferred taxes of the Parent
Company, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries have been determined based on the temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the respective assets and liabilities of the applicable entities.  
 Certain transfers of cash between subsidiaries and their parent companies and intercompany dividends are reflected as cash
flows from investing and financing activities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows. All other intercompany activity is reflected in cash flows from operations.  
 Management believes that the allocations and adjustments noted above are reasonable. However, such allocations and
adjustments may not be indicative of the actual amounts that would have been incurred had the Parent Company, Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries operated independently.

   Part II. Other Information   
    Item 1A. Risk Factors.   
 Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors as previously disclosed in
Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      The
proposed acquisition of Time Warner by AT T may cause disruption in Time Warner s business.      On
October 22, 2016, the Company entered into the merger agreement with AT T, pursuant to which Time Warner will combine with AT T in a stock-and-cash transaction. The merger agreement generally requires the Company to operate its business
in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed merger and restricts the Company, without AT T s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the merger is completed. These restrictions may affect the Company s
ability to execute its business strategies and attain its financial and other goals and may impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
 In connection with the pending merger, current and prospective employees of Time Warner may experience
uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of Time Warner to attract and retain key personnel while the merger is pending. Key employees may depart because
of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the merger, and may depart prior to payments that may be due pursuant to the retention plan put in place in connection
with the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that Time Warner will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that Time Warner has been able to in the past.  
 The proposed merger further could cause disruptions to the Company s business or business relationships,
which could have an adverse impact on results of operations. Parties with which the Company has business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek
alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with the Company. Parties with whom the Company otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with
third parties.    The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on
management and internal resources. The diversion of management s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect the Company s financial results.  
 The Company also could be subject to litigation related to the proposed merger, which could result in significant costs and
expenses. In addition to potential litigation-related expenses, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed
merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the proposed merger is consummated.      Failure to
complete the merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of the Time Warner common stock, as well as the Company s future business and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    
 The Company currently anticipates the merger will close before year-end 2017, but it cannot be certain when or if the
conditions for the proposed merger will be satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. The merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived, including the
adoption of the merger agreement by the holders of Time Warner common stock and the receipt of required antitrust and other regulatory approvals. In the event that the merger is not completed for any reason, the holders of Time Warner common stock
will not receive any payment for their shares of Time Warner common stock in connection with the proposed merger. Instead, Time Warner will remain an independent public company and holders of Time Warner common stock will continue to own their
shares of Time Warner common stock.    Additionally, if the merger is not consummated in a timely manner or at all, Time
Warner s ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows:      

Time Warner may experience negative reactions from financial markets and the stock price could decline;

it may experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties;

management s focus would have been diverted from pursuing other opportunities that could have been
beneficial to Time Warner; and     

the costs of pursuing the merger may be higher than anticipated and would be born entirely by Time Warner.
    
      58  

Table of Contents  

  If the merger with AT T is not completed, there can be no assurance that
these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect Time Warner s stock price, business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.  
   Time Warner and AT T may be unable to obtain the approvals required to complete the proposed merger.    
 The consummation of the proposed merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including Time
Warner stockholder approval and receipt of certain domestic and foreign antitrust and other regulatory approvals. If Time Warner and AT T are unable to obtain these approvals, they may be unable to consummate the proposed merger. In
addition, AT T s obligation to consummate the merger is subject to the condition that the required regulatory approvals be obtained without the imposition of certain divestiture requirements, capital expenditure requirements or other
specified adverse effects. As a result, there can be no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and the proposed merger will be completed or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined
company following the consummation of the merger or will not result in the abandonment or delay of the proposed merger.      The merger
agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of Time Warner.      The merger
agreement contains  no shop  provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict Time Warner s ability to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage and facilitate competing third-party proposals for the acquisition of its stock
or assets. In addition, before the Time Warner board of directors withdraws, qualifies or modifies its recommendation of the proposed merger with AT T or terminates the merger agreement to enter into a third-party acquisition proposal, AT T
generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the proposed merger. In some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Time Warner will be required to pay a termination fee of $1.725 billion.  
 These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a
significant portion of Time Warner from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or
might otherwise result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to Time Warner stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain
circumstances.    If the merger agreement is terminated and Time Warner decides to seek another business combination, it may
not be able to negotiate or consummate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger agreement.

the open market or in privately negotiated transactions., with the size and timing of these purchases based on a number of factors, including price and business and market conditions. The Company has repurchased shares of its common stock pursuant
to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Company discontinued share repurchases.

Request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law; (ii) the Special Meeting Request is received by the Corporation during the period commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary
of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (iii) an identical or substantially similar item (a  Similar Item ) was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within
120 days prior to receipt by the Corporation of such Special Meeting Request (and, for purposes of this clause (iii), the election of directors shall be deemed a  Similar Item  with respect to all items of business involving the election
or removal of directors); (iv) a Similar Item is included in the Corporation s notice as an item of business to be brought before a stockholder meeting that has been called but not yet held; or (v) such Special Meeting Request was
made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable law.  
 Stockholders may revoke a Special Meeting Request by written revocation delivered to the Corporation at any time prior to the special
meeting;  provided ,  however , the Board shall have the discretion to determine whether or not to proceed with the special meeting.  
 If none of the stockholders who submitted the Special Meeting Request for a special meeting of stockholders appears or sends a qualified
representative to present the proposal(s) or business submitted by the stockholders for consideration at the special meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal(s) or business for a vote at such meeting.  
 SECTION 4.   Notice of Meetings .  Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of each meeting of the stockholders,
whether annual or special, shall be given by the Corporation not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to notice of the meeting and shall be called by the Corporation. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Each such notice shall state
the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice of any meeting of the stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder who shall
attend such meeting in person or by proxy without protesting, prior to or at the commencement of the meeting, the lack of proper notice to such stockholder, or who shall waive notice thereof as provided in Article X of these By-laws. Notice of
adjournment of a meeting of the stockholders need not be given if the time and place to which it is adjourned are announced at such meeting, unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or, after adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting.    SECTION 5.   Quorum .  Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate, the
holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders  
      3  

entitled to vote generally, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders;  provided ,  however , that in the case of any vote to be taken
by classes or series, the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders of a particular class or series, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of such class or series.  
 SECTION 6.   Adjournments .  The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be
cast by the stockholders who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether or not a quorum is present. In the event that a quorum does not exist with respect to any vote to be taken by a particular class or
series, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders of such class or series who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting with respect to the vote(s) to be taken by
such class or series. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.  
 SECTION 7.   Order of Business .  At each meeting of the stockholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in the absence
of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, (if the position is held by an individual other than the Chairman of the Board), or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, such person as shall be
selected by the Board shall act as chairman of the meeting. The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such
rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the maintenance of order and safety,
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls.  
 At any annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the annual meeting
(i) by or at the direction of the chairman of the meeting or (ii) by any stockholder who is a holder of record at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 7, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who
complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 7.    For business properly to be brought before an annual meeting of
stockholders by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting;  provided ,  however , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is
more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered or received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the
 
      4  

close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made;
 provided ,  further , that for the purpose of calculating the timeliness of stockholder notices for the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders, the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting shall be deemed to be May 18,
2000. To be in proper written form, a stockholder s notice to the Secretary shall set forth in writing as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to
be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation s books, of the stockholder proposing such business; (iii) the class
or series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business; and (v) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such
stockholder s proposal, a representation to that effect. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an
annual meeting and such stockholder s proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by management of the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting;  provided ,  however , that if such stockholder
does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at such annual meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been
received by the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7. The chairman of an annual
meeting may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting which fails to comply with the foregoing procedures or, in the case of a stockholder proposal, if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder s
proposal without having made the representation required by clause (v) of the third preceding sentence.    SECTION
8.   List of Stockholders .  It shall be the duty of the Secretary or other officer who has charge of the stock ledger to prepare and make, at least 10 days before each meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote thereat, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in such stockholder s name. Such list shall be produced and kept available at the times
and places required by law.    SECTION 9.   Voting .  Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate,
each stockholder of record of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock shall be entitled at each meeting of the stockholders to such number of votes, if any, for each share of such stock as may be fixed in the Certificate or in the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such stock, and each stockholder of record of Common Stock shall be entitled at each meeting of the stockholders to one vote for each share of such stock, in each case,
registered in such stockholder s name on the books of the Corporation:  
      5  

(1) on the date fixed pursuant to Section 6 of Article VII of these By-laws
as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting; or    (2) if no
such record date shall have been so fixed, then at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of such meeting is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held.    Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders may authorize not in excess of three persons to
act for such stockholder by proxy. Any such proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of such meeting at or prior to the time designated for holding such meeting, but in any event not later than the time designated in the order of business for
so delivering such proxies. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  
 At each meeting of the stockholders, all corporate actions to be taken by vote of the stockholders (except as otherwise required by law and
except as otherwise provided in the Certificate or these By-laws) shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon who are present in person or represented by proxy, and where a separate vote by class
or series is required, a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders of such class or series who are present in person or represented by proxy shall be the act of such class or series.  
 Unless required by law or determined by the chairman of the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any matter, including the election of
directors, need not be by written ballot.    SECTION 10.   Inspectors .  The chairman of the meeting shall appoint
two or more inspectors to act at any meeting of the stockholders. Such inspectors shall perform such duties as shall be required by law or specified by the chairman of the meeting. Inspectors need not be stockholders. No director or
nominee for the office of director shall be appointed such inspector.    SECTION 11.   Public Announcements .  For
the purpose of Section 7 of this Article II and Section 3 of Article III,  public announcement  shall mean disclosure (i) in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Reuters Information Service or any similar
or successor news wire service or (ii) in a communication distributed generally to stockholders and in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any successor provisions thereto.  
      6  

ARTICLE III  
  Board of Directors   
 SECTION 1.   General Powers .  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction of the Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.  
 SECTION 2.   Number, Qualification and Election .  Except as otherwise fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of
Article IV of the Certificate relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or series of stock having preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or
winding up, the number of directors constituting the Whole Board shall be determined from time to time by the Board. The term  Whole Board  shall mean the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies
or unfilled previously authorized directorships.    The directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of shares of any
series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock of the Corporation as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up pursuant to the terms of Article IV of the
Certificate or any resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such stock adopted by the Board, shall be elected by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon at each annual meeting of the stockholders, and shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of the stockholders and until each of their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.    Each director
shall be at least 21 years of age. Directors need not be stockholders of the Corporation.    In any uncontested election of directors,
each person receiving a majority of the votes cast shall be deemed elected. For purposes of this paragraph, a  majority of the votes cast  shall mean that the number of votes cast  for  a director must exceed the number of
votes cast  against  that director (with  abstentions  and  broker non-votes  not counted as a vote cast with respect to that director). In any contested election of directors, the persons receiving a plurality of
the votes cast, up to the number of directors to be elected in such election, shall be deemed elected. Any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast shall submit an offer to resign from the Board no later than two
weeks after the certification by the Corporation of the voting results. An uncontested election is one in which the number of individuals who have been nominated for election as a director is equal to, or less than, the number of directors
constituting the Whole Board. A contested election is one in which the number of persons nominated exceeds the number of directors to be elected as of the date that is ten days prior to the date that the Corporation first mails its notice of
meeting for such meeting to the stockholders.  
      7  

The Board shall consider the resignation offer and may either (i) accept the offer of
resignation or (ii) reject the offer and seek to address the underlying cause(s) of the majority-withheld vote. While the Board may delegate to a committee the authority to assist the Board in its review of the matter, the Board shall
decide whether to accept or reject the resignation offer within 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote. Once the Board makes this decision, the Corporation will promptly make a public announcement of the Board s
decision in the manner described in Section 11 of Article II. If the Board rejects the offer of resignation, the public announcement will include a statement regarding the reasons for its decision.  
 The chairman of the nominating and governance committee described in Section 1 of Article IV will have the authority to manage the
Board s review of the resignation offer. In the event it is the chairman of the nominating and governance committee who received a majority-withheld vote, the independent directors who did not receive majority-withheld votes shall select a
director to manage the process, and that director shall have the authority otherwise delegated to the chairman of the nominating and governance committee by this Section 2 of Article III. Any director who tenders his or her offer of resignation
as a result of a majority-withheld vote shall not participate in the committee s or the Board s deliberations or vote on whether to accept or reject the resignation offer.  
 A majority of the members of the Board shall be persons determined by the Board to be independent directors. In order to determine that
a director is independent pursuant to this Section 2, the Board shall make an affirmative determination that the director satisfies applicable regulatory requirements to be an independent director of the Corporation, that the director has no
material relationship with the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ), and that the director is free of any other relationship (with the Company or otherwise) that would interfere with the exercise of
independent judgment by such director. In making this determination, the Board shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including commercial, charitable, and familial relationships that exist between the director and the Company, or
between entities with which the director is affiliated and the Company. The Board may, from time to time, adopt categorical standards to guide its determination of materiality.  
 SECTION 3.   Notification of Nominations .  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or
Series Common Stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board or by any stockholder
(x) who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice of nomination provided for in this Section 3 and who is entitled to vote for the election of directors and who complies with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3 or (y) pursuant to and in compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 15 of this Article III. Any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors at a meeting may nominate persons for election as
directors pursuant to this Section 3 only if timely written notice of such stockholder s intent to make such nomination is given,  
      8  

either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder s notice pursuant to this Section 3 must be delivered to or mailed
and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of the stockholders, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the
date of the immediately preceding annual meeting;  provided ,  however , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered or received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made;  provided ,  further , that for the purpose of calculating the timeliness of stockholder notices for the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders, the
date of the immediately preceding annual meeting shall be deemed to be May 18, 2000 and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, not earlier than the 90th day
prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special
meeting and of the nominees to be elected at such meeting. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation s books, of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and the name and
address of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (c) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (d) a description of all arrangements or understandings between
the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (e) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by
such stockholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had each nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; (f) the
executed written consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected; and (g) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder s nominee(s), a representation to that effect. The
chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the stockholder solicits proxies in favor of such stockholder s nominee(s) without having made the
representations required by the immediately preceding sentence. If such stockholder does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at such meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote at such
meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3 or Section 15 of this Article III
shall be eligible to serve as directors of the Corporation.    Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding paragraph of this
Section 3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the  
      9  

Board at an annual meeting of the stockholders is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for directors or specifying the size of the increased Board made by the
Corporation at least 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, a stockholder s notice required by this Section 3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees
for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to or mailed to and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day
on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.    SECTION 4.   Quorum and Manner of
Acting .  Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these By-laws, a majority of the Whole Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board, and, except as so provided, the vote
of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board. The chairman of the meeting or a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting to another time and place whether or
not a quorum is present. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.  
 SECTION 5.   Place of Meeting .  Subject to Sections 6 and 7 of this Article III, the Board may hold its meetings at
such place or places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board may from time to time determine, or as shall be specified or fixed in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.  
 SECTION 6.   Regular Meetings .  No fewer than six regular meetings per year of the Board shall be held at such
times as the Board shall from time to time by resolution determine, at such locations as the Board may determine. If any day fixed for a regular meeting shall be a legal holiday under the laws of the place where the meeting is to be held, the
meeting which would otherwise be held on that day shall be held at the same hour on the next succeeding business day.    SECTION
7.   Special Meetings .  Special meetings of the Board shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or by a majority of the non-employee directors, and shall be held at such place,
on such date and at such time as he or they, as applicable, shall fix.    SECTION 8.   Notice of
Meetings .  Notice of regular meetings of the Board or of any adjourned meeting thereof need not be given. Notice of each special meeting of the Board shall be given by overnight delivery service or mailed to each director, in
either case addressed to such director at such director s residence or usual place of business, at least two days before the day on which the meeting is to be held or shall be sent to such director at such place by telecopy or by electronic
transmission or shall be given personally or by telephone, not later than the day before the meeting is to be held, but notice need not be given to any director who shall, either before or after the  

      10  

meeting, submit a waiver of such notice or who shall attend such meeting without protesting, prior to or at its commencement, the lack of notice to such director. Unless otherwise required
by these By-laws, every such notice shall state the time and place but need not state the purpose of the meeting.    SECTION
9.   Rules and Regulations .  The Board may adopt such rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of law, the Certificate or these By-laws for the conduct of its meetings and management of the affairs of the
Corporation as the Board may deem proper.    SECTION 10.   Participation in Meeting by Means of Communications
Equipment .  Any one or more members of the Board or any committee thereof may participate in any meeting of the Board or of any such committee by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other or as otherwise permitted by law, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.  
 SECTION 11.   Action Without Meeting .  Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or
any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all of the members of the Board or of any such committee consent thereto in writing or as otherwise permitted by law and, if required by law, the writing or writings are filed with the minutes
or proceedings of the Board or of such committee.    SECTION 12.   Resignations .  Any director of the Corporation
may at any time resign by giving written notice to the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time be not specified therein,
upon receipt thereof; and, unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.  
 SECTION 13.   Vacancies .  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common
Stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock of the Corporation as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up, any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation, removal or other cause
shall only be filled by the Board, and not by the stockholders, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board, or by a sole remaining director, and newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall only be filled by the Board, or if not so filled, by the stockholders at the next annual meeting thereof or at a special meeting called for that purpose in accordance with
Section 3 of Article II of these By-laws. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence of this Section 13 shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until such director s successor
shall have been elected and qualified.    SECTION 14.   Compensation .  Each director, in consideration of such
person serving as a director, shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation such  
      11  

amount per annum and such fees (payable in cash or stock-based compensation) for attendance at meetings of the Board or of committees of the Board, or both, as the Board shall from time to time
determine. In addition, each director shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation reimbursement for the reasonable expenses incurred by such person in connection with the performance of such person s duties as a
director. Nothing contained in this Section 14 shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.  
 SECTION 15.   Proxy Access .  
 (a)    The Corporation shall include in its proxy statement and on its form of proxy for an annual meeting of the
stockholders the name of, and shall include in its proxy statement the required information specified below relating to, any person nominated for election to the Board by a stockholder that satisfies, or by a group of no more than 20 stockholders
that together satisfy, the requirements of this Section 15, and who expressly elects at the time of providing the notice required by this Section 15 to have its nominee included in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this
Section 15. For purposes of this Section 15, the information that the Corporation will be required to include in its proxy statement is: (i) the information concerning the nominee and the stockholder or group of stockholders who
nominated such nominee that is required to be disclosed in the Corporation s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (ii) if such stockholder or group of stockholders so
elects, a statement pursuant to paragraph (j) of this Section 15. No person may be a member of more than one group of persons constituting a group that satisfies the requirements of this Section 15. In determining whether a
stockholder or group of stockholders is qualified to make a nomination under this Section 15, two or more funds that are (A) under common management and investment control, (B) under common management and funded primarily by the same
employer, or (C) a  group of investment companies,  as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, shall be treated as one stockholder.  
 (b)    For nominations pursuant to this Section 15 to be properly submitted by a stockholder or group of
stockholders, such stockholder or group of stockholders must give timely written notice of such nominations to the Secretary. To be considered timely under this Section 15, a stockholder s notice, together with the other information
required by this Section 15, must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 150 calendar days nor more than 180 calendar days before the anniversary date of the Corporation s proxy
statement being released to stockholders in connection with the prior year s annual meeting;  provided ,  however , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days
later than such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered or received not earlier than the 180th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 150th day
prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.  
      12  

(c)    The number of stockholder nominees nominated pursuant to this
Section 15 (including any nominees that were submitted by a stockholder or group of stockholders for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 15, but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board
decides to nominate as Board nominees) appearing in the Corporation s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, together with any nominees who were previously elected to the Board after being nominated pursuant to this
Section 15 at any of the preceding two annual meetings and who are re-nominated for election at such annual meeting by the Board, shall not exceed the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20% of the number of directors in office as of the last
day on which notice of a nomination in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 15 may be received by the Secretary pursuant to this Section 15, or if the number of directors calculated in this clause (ii) is not a
whole number, the closest whole number below 20%. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board after the last day on which notice of a nomination in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 15 may
be received by the Secretary pursuant to this Section 15, but before the date of the annual meeting of stockholders, and the Board resolves to reduce the size of the Board in connection therewith, the maximum number of stockholder nominees
nominated pursuant to this Section 15 included in the Corporation s proxy materials shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. Any stockholder or group of stockholders submitting more than one nominee for
inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 15 shall rank its nominees based on the order that such stockholder or group of stockholders desires such nominees to be selected for inclusion in the
Corporation s proxy materials in the event that the total number of stockholder nominees submitted by stockholders or groups of stockholders pursuant to this Section 15 exceeds the maximum number of stockholder nominees provided for in
this Section 15. In such event, the highest ranking stockholder nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 15 from each stockholder or group of stockholders will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation s proxy materials
until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of common stock of the Corporation each stockholder or group of stockholders disclosed as owned in its respective notice of a nomination submitted to
the Corporation in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 15. If the maximum number is not reached after the highest ranking stockholder nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 15 from each stockholder or group
of stockholders has been selected, this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is reached.  
 (d)    For purposes of this Section 15, a stockholder or group of stockholders shall be deemed to  own 
only those outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation as to which the stockholder or any member of a group of stockholders possesses both (i) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (ii) the full

to in Section 1 of this Article VI, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The Corporation may
enter into contracts with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or of any Covered Entity in furtherance of the provisions of this Article VI and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including,
without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided or authorized in this Article VI.  
 SECTION 3.   Indemnification Not Exclusive Right .  The right of indemnification provided in this Article VI shall

applicable to Proceedings commenced or continuing after the adoption of this Article VI, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after such adoption.  
 SECTION 4.   Advancement of Expenses; Procedures; Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings; Remedies .  In
furtherance, but not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, presumptions and remedies shall apply with respect to advancement of expenses and the right to indemnification under this Article VI:  
 (a)   Advancement of Expenses .  All reasonable expenses (including attorneys  fees) incurred by
or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding shall be advanced to the Indemnitee by the Corporation within 20 days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or
advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall
include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amounts advanced if ultimately it should be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such expenses pursuant to this Article
VI.    (b)   Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification . 
 (i)  To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary a written request, including such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the  Supporting Documentation ). The determination
of the Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation. The Secretary shall, promptly upon
receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification.  
      25  

(ii)  The Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification under this Article VI shall
be determined in one of the following ways: (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined in Section 4(e) of this Article VI), whether or not they constitute a quorum of the Board, or by a committee of
Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors; (B) by a written opinion of Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined in Section 4(e) of this Article VI) if (x) a Change in Control shall have
occurred and the Indemnitee so requests or (y) there are no Disinterested Directors or a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (C) by the stockholders of the Corporation; or (D) as provided in Section 4(c) of this
Article VI.    (iii)  In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel
pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii) of this Article VI, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably object;  provided ,
 however , that if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which a majority of the Disinterested Directors does not reasonably object.  
 (c)   Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings . Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VI, if a
Change in Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article VI (with respect to actions or omissions occurring prior to such Change in Control) upon submission of a request for
indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with Section 4(b)(i) of this Article VI, and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary
determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under Section 4(b) of this Article VI to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within 60 days after
receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor, together with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to be, and shall be, entitled to indemnification unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a
material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any Proceeding described in Section 1 of this Article VI, or of any claim,
issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of  nolo   contendere  or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption
that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable
cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.    (d)   Remedies of Indemnitee .  (i)  In the event
that a determination is made pursuant to Section 4(b) of this Article VI that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Article VI, (A) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an
 
      26  

adjudication of entitlement to such indemnification either, at the Indemnitee s sole option, in (x) an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent
jurisdiction or (y) an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (B) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be de novo and the Indemnitee shall not be
prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (C) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification under this Article VI (with respect to actions or omissions occurring prior to such Change in Control).  
 (ii)  If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made, pursuant to Section 4(b) or (c) of this
Article VI, that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be
conclusively bound by such determination unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited
by law. In the event that (X) advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Article VI or (Y) payment of indemnification is not made within five days after a determination of entitlement to
indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 4(b) or (c) of this Article VI, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Corporation s obligation to pay to the Indemnitee such
advancement of expenses or indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the
Indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of an event described in sub-clause (A) or (B) of this clause (ii) (a  Disqualifying Event  provided, however, that in any such action the Corporation
shall have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event.   (iii)  The Corporation shall be precluded from
asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4(d) that the procedures and presumptions of this Article VI are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such
arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article VI.   (iv)  In the event that the Indemnitee,
pursuant to this Section 4(d), seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Article VI, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and
shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or
arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be prorated
accordingly.  
      27

five years has been, retained to represent: (x) the Corporation or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party or (y) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Article

of interest in representing either the Corporation or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee s rights under this Article VI.  
 SECTION 5.   Severability .  If any provision or provisions of this Article VI shall be held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI
(including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or enforceable) shall be construed so as to give

security and not absolutely, and written notice thereof shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent, such fact shall be stated in the entry of the transfer. No transfer of shares shall be valid as against the Corporation, its

may, in their discretion, require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such person s legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as they may direct to indemnify the
Corporation and said transfer agents and registrars against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.  
 SECTION 5.   Regulations .  The Board may make such additional rules and regulations as it may deem expedient
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificated or uncertificated shares of stock of each class and series of the Corporation and may make such rules and take such action as it may deem expedient concerning the issue of certificates

on the Notice. Each RSU represents the unfunded, unsecured right of the Participant to receive a Share on the applicable Vesting Date, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. RSUs do not constitute issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock for any corporate purposes and do not confer on the Participant any right to vote on matters that are submitted to a vote of holders of Shares.    
      3  

3. 
   Dividend Equivalents and Retained Distributions   .  If on any date while RSUs are outstanding hereunder the Company shall pay any regular cash dividend on the Shares, then, for each RSU held by the
Participant on the record date, the Participant shall be paid an amount of cash equal to the dividend paid on a Share (the    Dividend Equivalents   ), with such payment made at the time that such dividends are paid to holders of
Shares. If on any date while RSUs are outstanding hereunder the Company shall pay any dividend other than a regular cash dividend or make any other distribution on the Shares, the Participant shall be credited with a bookkeeping entry equivalent to
such dividend or distribution for each RSU held by the Participant on the record date for such dividend or distribution, but the Company shall retain custody of all such dividends and distributions unless the Board has in its sole discretion
determined that an amount equivalent to such dividend or distribution shall be paid currently to the Participant (the    Retained Distributions     provided ,  however , that if the Retained Distribution relates to a
dividend paid in Shares, the Participant shall receive an additional amount of RSUs equal to the product of (I) the aggregate number of RSUs held by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement through the related dividend record date, multiplied
by (II) the number of Shares (including any fraction thereof) payable as a dividend on a Share. Retained Distributions will not bear interest and will be subject to the same restrictions as the RSUs to which they relate. Notwithstanding
anything else contained in this Section 3, no payment of Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions shall occur before the first date on which a payment could be made without subjecting the Participant to tax under the provisions of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ).        

4. 
   Vesting and Delivery of Vested Securities   .         

a) 
 Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 6 and 7, the vesting of the RSUs and any Retained Distributions relating thereto shall occur only if the Participant has continued in Employment of the Company or any of its
Affiliates on the Vesting Date and has continuously been so employed since the Date of Grant (as set forth in the Notice). Subject to the requirements and limitations in the immediately preceding sentence and the other terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the Plan, no later than 60 days after each Vesting Date with respect to the Award, the Company shall issue or transfer to the Participant the number of Shares corresponding to such Vesting Date and the Retained Distributions, if
any, covered by that portion of the Award.        

b) 
  RSUs Extinguished . Upon each issuance or transfer of Shares in accordance with this Agreement, a number of RSUs equal to the number of Shares issued or transferred to the Participant shall be extinguished and
such number of RSUs will not be considered to be held by the Participant for any purpose.    
      4  

c) 
  Final Issuance . Upon the final issuance or transfer of Shares and Retained Distributions, if any, to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement, in lieu of a fractional Share, the Participant shall receive a cash
payment equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional Share.        

d)

payment could be made without subjecting the Participant to tax under the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.        

5. 
   Termination of Employment   .           

a) 
 Notwithstanding any provision of an employment agreement between the Participant and the Company or an Affiliate or any severance plan that provides for different treatment, (i) if, prior to the Vesting
Commencement Date, the Participant s Employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason other than those described in Sections 5(b) or Section 6 (including as a result of termination of the Participant s
Employment without Cause or due to Retirement), then all portions of the Award and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall be completely forfeited on the date of any such termination, and (ii) if, on or following the Vesting
Commencement Date but prior to the Vesting Date with respect to any portion of the Award, the Participant s Employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason other than those described in Section 5(b), (c) or
(d) or in Section 6, then the RSUs covered by such portion of the Award and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall be completely forfeited on the date of any such termination.    

b) 
 If, on any date while RSUs are outstanding hereunder, the Participant s Employment terminates as a result of his or her death or Disability, then, to the extent the RSUs were not extinguished or forfeited prior to
such termination of Employment, the RSUs and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall fully vest on the date of any such termination, and Shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (along with the Retained
Distributions relating thereto) as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days, following such termination of Employment.        

c) 
   If, on or after the Vesting Commencement Date and prior to a Change of Control, the Participant s Employment
(i) terminates as a result of his or her Retirement (taking into account the provision in the definition thereof relating to the status of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) or (ii) is terminated by the Company and its
Affiliates for any     
      5  

reason other than for Cause (x) on a date when the Participant satisfies the requirements for Retirement or (y) on a date when the Participant does not satisfy the requirements for
Retirement, but the Participant would satisfy the requirements for Retirement during a Severance Period (for purposes of this clause (ii), based solely on whether the Participant has attained the relevant age and service requirements in the
definition of Retirement and without regard to the status of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the   Age and Service Requirements  )), then the RSUs and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall fully vest
on the date of such termination of Employment; and Shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (along with the Retained Distributions relating thereto) as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days,
following such termination of Employment.         

d) 
 If, on or after the Vesting Commencement Date and prior to a Change of Control, the Participant s Employment is terminated by the Company and its Affiliates for any reason other than for Cause (unless such
termination is due to death or Disability) on a date when the Participant does not satisfy the Age and Service Requirements and the Participant would not satisfy such requirements by the end of a Severance Period, then the RSUs that were scheduled
to vest on any Vesting Dates that occur before the end of a Severance Period, and any Retained Distributions relating thereto, shall become vested, and Shares subject to such RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (along with the
Retained Distributions relating thereto) as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days, following such termination of Employment. The portion of the RSUs that have a Vesting Date after the end of a Severance Period and any Retained
Distributions related thereto shall be completely forfeited on the date of any such termination.      For purposes of this
Section 5, a temporary leave of absence shall not constitute a termination of Employment or a failure to be continuously employed by the Company or any Affiliate regardless of the Participant s payroll status during such leave of absence
if such leave of absence is approved in writing by the Company or any Affiliate;  provided , that such leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence and not a Separation From Service under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h)(1)(i). Notice
of any such approved leave of absence should be sent to the Company at One Time Warner Center, New York, New York 10019, attention: Director, Global Stock Plans Administration, but such notice shall not be required for the leave of absence to be
considered approved.    Furthermore, if you are subject to an employment agreement that provides you the right to terminate your employment
if the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is in material breach of its obligations thereunder, then if you terminate your employment as a result of a material breach, it will be deemed a termination without Cause for purposes of this Section 5,
regardless of whether it occurs prior to, upon or after the closing of the transactions contemplated by, or following the termination of, the Merger Agreement.  
      6  

In the event the Participant s Employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates is
terminated, the Participant shall have no claim against the Company with respect to the RSUs and related Retained Distributions, if any, other than as set forth in this Section 5 (and, if applicable, Section 6), the provisions of this
Section 5 (and, if applicable, Section 6) being the sole remedy of the Participant with respect thereto.      

6. 
   Acceleration of Vesting Date .  In the event a Change in Control, subject to Section 7, has occurred on any date while RSUs are outstanding hereunder, (A) the Award will vest in full upon the
earliest of (i) the Vesting Date with respect to each portion of the Award, (ii) the Participant s Retirement and (iii) the termination of the Participant s Employment by the Company or any of its Affiliates (I) by the
Company other than for Cause (unless such termination is due to death or Disability) or (II) by the Participant for Good Reason and (B) Shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant, as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than 60 days following such Vesting Date, along with the Retained Distributions related thereto.        

7. 
   Limitation on Acceleration .         

a) 
   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or this Agreement, in the event it is determined by an
independent nationally recognized public accounting firm, which is engaged and paid for by the Company prior to the consummation of any transaction constituting a Change in Control (which for purposes of this Section 7 shall mean a change in
ownership or control as determined in accordance with the regulations promulgated under Section 280G of the Code), which accounting firm shall in no event be the accounting firm for the entity seeking to effectuate the Change in Control (the
   Accountant   ), which determination shall be certified by the Accountant and set forth in a certificate delivered to the Participant not less than ten (10) business days prior to the Change in Control setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of the Accountant s calculations (including any assumptions that the Accountant made in performing the calculations), that part or all of the consideration, compensation or benefits to be paid to such Participant
under this Agreement constitute  parachute payments  under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, then, if the aggregate present value of such parachute payments, singularly or together with the aggregate present value of any consideration,
compensation or benefits to be paid to such Participant under any other plan, arrangement or agreement which constitute  parachute payments  (collectively, the    Parachute Amount   ) exceeds the maximum amount that
would not give rise to any liability under Section 4999 of the Code, the amounts constituting  parachute payments  which would otherwise be payable to such Participant or for
    
      7  

such Participant s benefit shall be reduced to the maximum amount that would not give rise to any liability under Section 4999 of the Code (the    Reduced
Amount     provided  that such amounts shall not be so reduced if the Accountant determines that without such reduction such Participant would be entitled to receive and retain, on a net after-tax basis (including, without
limitation, any excise taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code), an amount which is greater than the amount, on a net after-tax basis, that such Participant would be entitled to retain upon receipt of the Reduced Amount. In connection with
making determinations under this Section 7, the Accountant shall take into account any positions to mitigate any excise taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code, such as the value of any reasonable compensation for services to be
rendered by the Participant before or after the Change in Control, including any amounts payable to such Participant following such Participant s termination of employment hereunder with respect to any non-competition provisions that may apply
to such Participant, and the Company shall cooperate in the valuation of any such services, including any non-competition provisions.         

b) 
 If the determination made pursuant to this Section 7 results in a reduction of the payments that would otherwise be paid to the Participant except for the application of this Section 7, the Company shall
promptly give such Participant notice of such determination. Such reduction in payments shall be first applied to reduce any cash payments that such Participant would otherwise be entitled to receive under this Agreement or otherwise and shall
thereafter be applied to reduce other payments and benefits, in each case, in reverse order beginning with the payments or benefits that are to be paid the furthest in time from the date of such determination, unless, to the extent permitted by
Section 409A of the Code, such Participant elects to have the reduction in payments applied in a different order;  provided  that, in no event may such payments be reduced in a manner that would result in subjecting such Participant to
additional taxation under Section 409A of the Code.        

c) 
   As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of a
determination hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the Participant s benefit pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (each, an
   Overpayment   ) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the Participant s benefit pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an
   Underpayment   ), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accountant, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the
Company or the Participant which the Accountant believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for such Participant s benefit
    
      8  

shall be repaid by such Participant to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code;  provided ,  however ,
that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which such Participant is subject to tax under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the
event that the Accountant, based on controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for such Participant s benefit together with
interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.         

d) 
 In the event of any dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with respect to the application of this Section 7, the Participant shall control the issues involved in such dispute and
make all final determinations with regard to such issues. The Company shall promptly pay, upon demand by such Participant, all legal fees, court costs, fees of experts and other costs and expenses which such Participant incurs in any actual,
threatened or contemplated contest of such Participant s interpretation of, or determination under, the provisions of this Section 7.        

8. 
   Withholding Taxes   .         

a) 
   Obligation to Pay Withholding Taxes   .  The Participant acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of any action the Company or the Participant s employer takes with respect to any or all income
tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (the    Tax-Related Items   ), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant (i) is and remains the
Participant s responsibility and (ii) may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Participant s employer. The Participant further agrees and acknowledges that the Company and the Participant s employer
(x) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the Award, the vesting of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired
from vesting of the RSUs, and the receipt of any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions; and (y) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability
for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, the Participant understands and acknowledges that if the Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant (as set forth in the Notice)
and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Company and/or the Participant s employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. The Company s
obligation to deliver the Shares subject to the RSUs or to pay any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions shall be subject to payment of all Tax-Related Items by the Participant.    
      9  

b) 
   Satisfaction of Company s Withholding Obligations .  At the time any portion of an Award of RSUs, Dividend Equivalent or Retained Distribution relating thereto, becomes taxable to the Participant, he or
she will be required to pay to the Company or the Participant s employer, as applicable, any Tax-Related Items due as a result of such taxable event. The Company or the Participant s employer shall have the right to withhold from any
payment in respect of RSUs, transfer of Shares acquired at vesting, or payment made to the Participant or to any person hereunder, whether such payment is to be made in cash or in Shares, all Tax-Related Items as shall be required, in the
determination of the Company, pursuant to any statute or governmental regulation or ruling. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company or the Participant s employer, in their sole discretion, may satisfy such withholding
obligation by any one or a combination of the following methods:        

(i) 
 by requiring the Participant to deliver a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker approved by the Company to sell a sufficient number of Shares to generate net proceeds (after
commission and fees) equal to the amount required to be withheld and promptly deliver such amount to the Company;        

(ii) 
 by requiring or allowing the Participant to pay the amount required to be withheld in cash or by check;        

(iii) 
 by deducting the amount required to be withheld from the Participant s current compensation or other amounts payable to the Participant;    

(iv) 
 by allowing the Participant to surrender other Shares that (A) in the case of Shares initially acquired from the Company (upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise), have been owned by the Participant for such
period (if any) as may be required to avoid a charge to the Company s earnings, and (B) have a fair market value on the date of surrender equal to the amount required to be withheld;    

(v) 
 by withholding a number of Shares to be issued upon delivery of Shares that have a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory amount required to be withheld;    

(vi) 
 by selling any Shares to the extent required to pay the amount required to be withheld; or        

(vii) 
 by such other means or method as the Committee in its sole discretion and without notice to the Participant deems appropriate.    
      10  

The Company may satisfy its obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items on Dividend Equivalents and Retained Distributions payable in cash by withholding a sufficient amount from the payment or by such other means as
the Committee in its sole discretion and without notice to the Participant deems appropriate, including withholding from salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, Shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the withholding
obligation for Tax-Related Items.        

The Company will not issue any Shares to the Participant until the Participant satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items. If the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding
in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due
as a result of any aspect of the Participant s participation in the Plan.        

c) 
   Compliance with Applicable Laws .  The Committee may also require the Participant to acknowledge that he or she shall not sell or transfer Shares except in compliance with all applicable laws, and may apply
such other restrictions on the sale or transfer of the Shares as it deems appropriate.        

9. 
   Changes in Capitalization and Government and Other Regulations .         

a) 
 The Award shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions as provided in this Agreement and in the Plan, which are incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof, including, without limitation, the
provisions of Section 10 of the Plan (generally relating to adjustments to the number of Shares subject to the Award, upon certain changes in capitalization and certain reorganizations and other transactions).    

b) 
 In the event that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated, upon the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the RSUs shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if and when such RSU vests in accordance with its terms, in accordance with Section 4.5(c) of the Merger Agreement.    

10. 
   Forfeiture .  A breach of any restrictions, terms and conditions of the Plan or this Agreement, with respect to any of the RSUs or any Dividend Equivalents and Retained Distributions relating thereto, except
as waived by the Board or the Committee, will cause a forfeiture of such RSUs and any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions relating thereto.    
      11  

11. 
   Amendment of Prior Agreements .         

a) 
   Restricted Stock Units .  In the case of any agreement between the Participant and the Company or an Affiliate relating to the grant of restricted stock units (   Prior RSUs   ) that is
outstanding on the date hereof (each, a    Prior RSU Agreement   ), the definition of  Good Reason  in such agreement, if any, shall be deemed deleted and replaced in its entirety with the definition contained herein.

b) 
   Options .  In the case of any agreement between the Participant and the Company or an Affiliate relating to the grant of Options (   Prior Options   ) that is outstanding immediately
prior to the date hereof (each, a    Prior Option Agreement   ), in the event of a Change in Control, any section of such agreement requiring the Participant to retain a number of Shares for a specified period following the date
of exercise of such Option shall be deemed deleted in its entirety and such requirement shall be deemed waived.        

c) 
 The Participant acknowledges and agrees that Sections 11(a) and 11(b) of this Agreement constitute an amendment of any Prior RSU Agreements and Prior Option Agreements.    

12. 
   Treatment of Grant Under Employment Agreement and Merger Agreement .  If the Participant is subject to an employment agreement between the Participant and the Company or an Affiliate that provides for annual
long-term incentive compensation, the Participant agrees that the RSUs covered by the Award shall be considered as if they had been granted on the Vesting Commencement Date. Furthermore, for purposes of Section 6.9(a)(ii) of the Merger
Agreement, the RSUs shall be considered as if they had been granted on the Vesting Commencement Date for purposes of determining the value of the Participant s target long-term incentive opportunity immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) and, if the Effective Time occurs during 2017, the RSUs shall count toward determining whether target annual cash bonus opportunities and target long-term incentive compensation opportunities for 2017 are no less
favorable in the aggregate than immediately prior to the Effective Time.        

13. 
   Right of Company to Terminate Employment .  Nothing contained in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates and the
Company and any such Affiliate shall have the right to terminate the Employment of the Participant at any such time, with or without cause, notwithstanding the fact that some or all of the RSUs and related Retained Distributions covered by this
Agreement may be forfeited as a result of such termination. The granting of the RSUs under this Agreement shall not confer on the Participant any right to any future Awards under the Plan.    
      12  

14. 
   Notices .  Any notice which either party hereto may be required or permitted to give the other shall be in writing and may be delivered personally or by mail, postage prepaid, addressed to Time Warner Inc.,
at One Time Warner Center, New York, NY 10019, attention Director, Global Stock Plans Administration, and to the Participant at his or her address, as it is shown on the records of the Company or its Affiliate, or in either case to such other
address as the Company or the Participant, as the case may be, by notice to the other may designate in writing from time to time.        

15. 
   Interpretation and Amendments .  The Board and the Committee (to the extent delegated by the Board) have plenary authority to interpret this Agreement and the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules
relating thereto and to make all other determinations in connection with the administration of the Plan. The Board or the Committee may from time to time modify or amend this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, provided that no
such amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the Participant under this Agreement without his or her consent.        

16. 
   Successors and Assigns .  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Participant

otherwise), any right to trial by jury in any forum in respect of any suit, action, or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement.

submits to the jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of New York located in the County of New York and the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for the purposes of
    
      13  

any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto to the extent permitted by applicable law hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that such suit, action or proceeding in the above-referenced courts is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceedings, is improper or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by

by (II) the number of Shares (including any fraction thereof) payable as a dividend on a Share. Retained Distributions will not bear interest and will be subject to the same restrictions as the RSUs to which they relate. Notwithstanding
anything else contained in this Section 3, no payment of Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions shall occur before the first date on which a payment could be made without subjecting the Participant to tax under the provisions of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ).        

4. 
   Vesting and Delivery of Vested Securities   .         

a) 
 Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 6 and 7, the vesting of the RSUs and any Retained Distributions relating thereto shall occur only if the Participant has continued in Employment of the Company or any of its
Affiliates on the Vesting Date and has continuously been so employed since the Date of Grant (as set forth in the Notice). Subject to the requirements and limitations in the immediately preceding sentence and the other terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the Plan, no later than 60 days after each Vesting Date with respect to the Award, the Company shall issue or transfer to the Participant the number of Shares corresponding to such Vesting Date and the Retained Distributions, if
any, covered by that portion of the Award.        

b) 
  RSUs Extinguished . Upon each issuance or transfer of Shares in accordance with this Agreement, a number of RSUs equal to the number of Shares issued or transferred to the Participant shall be extinguished and
such number of RSUs will not be considered to be held by the Participant for any purpose.    
      4  

c) 
  Final Issuance . Upon the final issuance or transfer of Shares and Retained Distributions, if any, to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement, in lieu of a fractional Share, the Participant shall receive a cash
payment equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional Share.        

d) 
  Section 409A . Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, no Shares shall be issued or transferred to a Participant and no Retained Distributions shall be paid before the first date on which a
payment could be made without subjecting the Participant to tax under the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.        

5. 
   Termination of Employment   .         

a) 
 Notwithstanding any provision of an employment agreement between the Participant and the Company or an Affiliate or any severance plan that provides for different treatment, (i) if, prior to the Vesting
Commencement Date, the Participant s Employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason other than those described in Sections 5(b) or Section 6 (including as a result of termination of the Participant s
Employment without Cause or due to Retirement), then all portions of the Award and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall be completely forfeited on the date of any such termination, and (ii) if, on or following the Vesting
Commencement Date but prior to the Vesting Date with respect to any portion of the Award, the Participant s Employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason other than those described in Section 5(b), (c) or
(d) or in Section 6, then the RSUs covered by such portion of the Award and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall be completely forfeited on the date of any such termination.    

b) 
 If, on any date while RSUs are outstanding hereunder, the Participant s Employment terminates as a result of his or her death or Disability, then, to the extent the RSUs were not extinguished or forfeited prior to
such termination of Employment, the RSUs and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall fully vest on the date of any such termination, and Shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (along with the Retained
Distributions relating thereto) as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days, following such termination of Employment.        

c) 
   If, on or after the Vesting Commencement Date and prior to a Change of Control, the Participant s Employment
(i) terminates as a result of his or her Retirement (taking into account the provision in the definition thereof relating to the status of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) or (ii) is terminated by the Company and its
Affiliates for any reason other than for Cause (x) on a date when the Participant satisfies the requirements for Retirement or (y) on a date when the Participant does not satisfy the requirements for Retirement, but the Participant would
satisfy     
      5  

the requirements for Retirement during a Severance Period (for purposes of this clause (ii), based solely on whether the Participant has attained the relevant age and service requirements in the
definition of Retirement and without regard to the status of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the   Age and Service Requirements  )), then the RSUs and all Retained Distributions relating thereto shall fully vest
on the date of such termination of Employment; and Shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (along with the Retained Distributions relating thereto) as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days,
following such termination of Employment.         

d) 
 If, on or after the Vesting Commencement Date and prior to a Change of Control, the Participant s Employment is terminated by the Company and its Affiliates for any reason other than for Cause (unless such
termination is due to death or Disability) on a date when the Participant does not satisfy the Age and Service Requirements and the Participant would not satisfy such requirements by the end of a Severance Period, then the RSUs that were scheduled
to vest on any Vesting Dates that occur before the end of a Severance Period, and any Retained Distributions relating thereto, shall become vested, and Shares subject to such RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant (along with the
Retained Distributions relating thereto) as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days, following such termination of Employment. The portion of the RSUs that have a Vesting Date after the end of a Severance Period and any Retained
Distributions related thereto shall be completely forfeited on the date of any such termination.      For purposes of this
Section 5, a temporary leave of absence shall not constitute a termination of Employment or a failure to be continuously employed by the Company or any Affiliate regardless of the Participant s payroll status during such leave of absence
if such leave of absence is approved in writing by the Company or any Affiliate;  provided , that such leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence and not a Separation From Service under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h)(1)(i). Notice
of any such approved leave of absence should be sent to the Company at One Time Warner Center, New York, New York 10019, attention: Director, Global Stock Plans Administration, but such notice shall not be required for the leave of absence to be
considered approved.    Furthermore, if you are subject to an employment agreement that provides you the right to terminate your employment
if the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is in material breach of its obligations thereunder, then if you terminate your employment as a result of a material breach, it will be deemed a termination without Cause for purposes of this Section 5,
regardless of whether it occurs prior to, upon or after the closing of the transactions contemplated by, or following the termination of, the Merger Agreement.  
      6  

In the event the Participant s Employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates is
terminated, the Participant shall have no claim against the Company with respect to the RSUs and related Retained Distributions, if any, other than as set forth in this Section 5 (and, if applicable, Section 6), the provisions of this
Section 5 (and, if applicable, Section 6) being the sole remedy of the Participant with respect thereto.      

6. 
   Acceleration of Vesting Date .  In the event a Change in Control, subject to Section 7, has occurred on any date while RSUs are outstanding hereunder, (A) the Award will vest in full upon the
earliest of (i) the Vesting Date with respect to each portion of the Award, (ii) the Participant s Retirement and (iii) the termination of the Participant s Employment by the Company or any of its Affiliates (I) by the
Company other than for Cause (unless such termination is due to death or Disability) or (II) by the Participant for Good Reason and (B) Shares subject to the RSUs shall be issued or transferred to the Participant, as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than 60 days following such Vesting Date, along with the Retained Distributions related thereto.        

7. 
   Limitation on Acceleration .         

a) 
   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or this Agreement, in the event it is determined by an
independent nationally recognized public accounting firm, which is engaged and paid for by the Company prior to the consummation of any transaction constituting a Change in Control (which for purposes of this Section 7 shall mean a change in
ownership or control as determined in accordance with the regulations promulgated under Section 280G of the Code), which accounting firm shall in no event be the accounting firm for the entity seeking to effectuate the Change in Control (the
   Accountant   ), which determination shall be certified by the Accountant and set forth in a certificate delivered to the Participant not less than ten (10) business days prior to the Change in Control setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of the Accountant s calculations (including any assumptions that the Accountant made in performing the calculations), that part or all of the consideration, compensation or benefits to be paid to such Participant
under this Agreement constitute  parachute payments  under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, then, if the aggregate present value of such parachute payments, singularly or together with the aggregate present value of any consideration,
compensation or benefits to be paid to such Participant under any other plan, arrangement or agreement which constitute  parachute payments  (collectively, the    Parachute Amount   ) exceeds the maximum amount that
would not give rise to any liability under Section 4999 of the Code, the amounts constituting  parachute payments  which would otherwise be payable to such Participant or for such Participant s benefit shall be reduced to the
maximum amount that would not give rise to any liability under Section 4999 of the Code (the    Reduced Amount     provided  that such amounts shall not be so reduced
    
      7  

if the Accountant determines that without such reduction such Participant would be entitled to receive and retain, on a net after-tax basis (including, without limitation, any excise taxes
payable under Section 4999 of the Code), an amount which is greater than the amount, on a net after-tax basis, that such Participant would be entitled to retain upon receipt of the Reduced Amount. In connection with making determinations under
this Section 7, the Accountant shall take into account any positions to mitigate any excise taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code, such as the value of any reasonable compensation for services to be rendered by the Participant
before or after the Change in Control, including any amounts payable to such Participant following such Participant s termination of employment hereunder with respect to any non-competition provisions that may apply to such Participant, and the
Company shall cooperate in the valuation of any such services, including any non-competition provisions.         

b) 
 If the determination made pursuant to this Section 7 results in a reduction of the payments that would otherwise be paid to the Participant except for the application of this Section 7, the Company shall
promptly give such Participant notice of such determination. Such reduction in payments shall be first applied to reduce any cash payments that such Participant would otherwise be entitled to receive under this Agreement or otherwise and shall
thereafter be applied to reduce other payments and benefits, in each case, in reverse order beginning with the payments or benefits that are to be paid the furthest in time from the date of such determination, unless, to the extent permitted by
Section 409A of the Code, such Participant elects to have the reduction in payments applied in a different order;  provided  that, in no event may such payments be reduced in a manner that would result in subjecting such Participant to
additional taxation under Section 409A of the Code.        

c) 
   As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of a
determination hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the Participant s benefit pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (each, an
   Overpayment   ) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the Participant s benefit pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an
   Underpayment   ), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accountant, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the
Company or the Participant which the Accountant believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for such Participant s benefit shall be
repaid by such Participant to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code;  provided ,  however , that no such repayment shall be required if and
    
      8  

to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which such Participant is subject to tax under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes.
In the event that the Accountant, based on controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for such Participant s benefit together
with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.         

d) 
 In the event of any dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with respect to the application of this Section 7, the Participant shall control the issues involved in such dispute and
make all final determinations with regard to such issues. The Company shall promptly pay, upon demand by such Participant, all legal fees, court costs, fees of experts and other costs and expenses which such Participant incurs in any actual,
threatened or contemplated contest of such Participant s interpretation of, or determination under, the provisions of this Section 7.        

8. 
   Withholding Taxes   .         

a) 
   Obligation to Pay Withholding Taxes   .  The Participant acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of any action the Company or the Participant s employer takes with respect to any or all income
tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (the    Tax-Related Items   ), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant (i) is and remains the
Participant s responsibility and (ii) may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Participant s employer. The Participant further agrees and acknowledges that the Company and the Participant s employer
(x) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the Award, the vesting of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired
from vesting of the RSUs, and the receipt of any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions; and (y) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability
for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, the Participant understands and acknowledges that if the Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant (as set forth in the Notice)
and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Company and/or the Participant s employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. The Company s
obligation to deliver the Shares subject to the RSUs or to pay any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions shall be subject to payment of all Tax-Related Items by the Participant.    
      9  

b) 
   Satisfaction of Company s Withholding Obligations   .  At the time any portion of an Award of RSUs, Dividend Equivalent or Retained Distribution relating thereto, becomes taxable to the
Participant, he or she will be required to pay to the Company or the Participant s employer, as applicable, any Tax-Related Items due as a result of such taxable event. The Company or the Participant s employer shall have the right to
withhold from any payment in respect of RSUs, transfer of Shares acquired at vesting, or payment made to the Participant or to any person hereunder, whether such payment is to be made in cash or in Shares, all Tax-Related Items as shall be required,
in the determination of the Company, pursuant to any statute or governmental regulation or ruling. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company or the Participant s employer, in their sole discretion, may satisfy such withholding
obligation by any one or a combination of the following methods:        

(i) 
 by requiring the Participant to deliver a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker approved by the Company to sell a sufficient number of Shares to generate net proceeds (after
commission and fees) equal to the amount required to be withheld and promptly deliver such amount to the Company;        

(ii) 
 by requiring or allowing the Participant to pay the amount required to be withheld in cash or by check;        

(iii) 
 by deducting the amount required to be withheld from the Participant s current compensation or other amounts payable to the Participant;    

(iv) 
 by allowing the Participant to surrender other Shares that (A) in the case of Shares initially acquired from the Company (upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise), have been owned by the Participant for such
period (if any) as may be required to avoid a charge to the Company s earnings, and (B) have a fair market value on the date of surrender equal to the amount required to be withheld;    

(v) 
 by withholding a number of Shares to be issued upon delivery of Shares that have a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory amount required to be withheld;    

(vi) 
 by selling any Shares to the extent required to pay the amount required to be withheld; or        

(vii) 
 by such other means or method as the Committee in its sole discretion and without notice to the Participant deems appropriate.        

The Company may satisfy its obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items on Dividend Equivalents and Retained
Distributions payable in cash by     
      10  

withholding a sufficient amount from the payment or by such other means as the Committee in its sole discretion and without notice to the Participant deems appropriate, including withholding from
salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, Shares or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items.         

The Company will not issue any Shares to the Participant until the Participant satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items. If the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding
in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due
as a result of any aspect of the Participant s participation in the Plan.        

c) 
   Compliance with Applicable Laws   .  The Committee may also require the Participant to acknowledge that he or she shall not sell or transfer Shares except in compliance with all applicable laws, and may
apply such other restrictions on the sale or transfer of the Shares as it deems appropriate.        

9. 
   Changes in Capitalization and Government and Other Regulations   .         

a) 
 The Award shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions as provided in this Agreement and in the Plan, which are incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof, including, without limitation, the
provisions of Section 10 of the Plan (generally relating to adjustments to the number of Shares subject to the Award, upon certain changes in capitalization and certain reorganizations and other transactions).    

b) 
 In the event that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated, upon the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the RSUs shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if and when such RSU vests in accordance with its terms, in accordance with Section 4.5(c) of the Merger Agreement.    

10. 
   Forfeiture   .  A breach of any restrictions, terms and conditions of the Plan or this Agreement, with respect to any of the RSUs or any Dividend Equivalents and Retained Distributions relating thereto,
except as waived by the Board or the Committee, will cause a forfeiture of such RSUs and any Dividend Equivalents or Retained Distributions relating thereto.        

11. 
   Amendment of Prior Agreements   .         

a) 
   Restricted Stock Units   .  In the case of any agreement between the Participant and the Company or an Affiliate relating to the grant of restricted stock units (   Prior RSUs   )
that is outstanding on the date hereof (each, a    Prior RSU Agreement   ), the definition of  Good Reason  in such agreement, if any, shall be deemed deleted and replaced in its entirety with the definition contained
herein.    
      11  

b) 
   Options   .  In the case of any agreement between the Participant and the Company or an Affiliate relating to the grant of Options (   Prior Options   ) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the date hereof (each, a    Prior Option Agreement   ), in the event of a Change in Control, any section of such agreement requiring the Participant to retain a number of Shares for a specified period

Exhibit 10.6   
 AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ) made October 22, 2016 and effective as of January 1, 2017
(the  Effective Date ) between TIME WARNER INC., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), and GARY GINSBERG ( You ).  
 You are currently employed by the Company pursuant to an Employment Agreement made April 14, 2014 and effective as of January 1,
2014, which superseded an agreement between the parties made and effective February 17, 2010 (the  Prior Agreement ). The Company wishes to amend and restate the terms of your employment with the Company and to secure your services on
a full-time basis for the period from the Effective Date to and including December 31, 2019 on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and you are willing to provide such services on and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement. You and the Company therefore agree as follows:    1.   Term of
Employment .  Your  term of employment  as this phrase is used throughout this Agreement shall be for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2019 (the  Term Date ), subject,
however, to earlier termination as set forth in this Agreement. Until the Effective Date, the Employment Agreement made April 14, 2014 and effective as of January 1, 2014 shall remain in full force and effect to the extent set forth
therein.    2.   Employment .  During the term of employment, you shall serve as Executive Vice President,
Corporate Marketing   Communications of the Company and you shall have the authority, functions, duties, powers and responsibilities normally associated with such position and such additional authority, functions, duties, powers and
responsibilities as may be assigned to you from time to time by the Company consistent with your senior position with the Company. During the term of employment, (i) your services shall be rendered on a substantially full-business time,
exclusive basis and you will apply on a full-business time basis all of your skill and experience to the performance of your duties, (ii) you shall have no other employment and, without the prior written consent of your manager or other more
senior officer of the Company in your reporting line, no outside business activities which require the devotion of substantial amounts of your time, and (iii) the place for the performance of your services shall be the principal executive
offices of the Company in the New York City metropolitan area, subject to such reasonable travel as may be required in the performance of your duties. The foregoing shall be subject to the Company s written policies, as in effect from time to
time, regarding vacations, holidays, illness and the like.  

3.   Compensation .  
 3.1   Base Salary .  The Company shall pay you a base salary at the rate of not less than $900,000 per annum
beginning on the Effective Date and continuing during the term of employment ( Base Salary ). The Company may increase, but not decrease, your Base Salary during the term of employment. Base Salary shall be paid in accordance with the
Company s customary payroll practices.    3.2   Bonus .  In addition to Base Salary, the Company typically
pays its executives an annual cash bonus ( Bonus ). Although the amount of your Bonus is fully discretionary, your target annual Bonus as a percentage of Base Salary is 200%. The Company may increase, but not decrease, your target annual
Bonus during the term of employment. Each year, your personal performance will be considered in the context of your executive duties and any individual goals set for you, and your actual Bonus will be determined based on your personal performance
and the Company s performance. Your Bonus amount, if any, will be paid to you between January 1 and March 15 of the calendar year immediately following the performance year in respect of which such Bonus is earned.  
 3.3   Long Term Incentive Compensation .  So long as the term of employment has not terminated, you shall be
eligible to receive annually from the Company long term incentive compensation with a target value beginning in 2017 of $1,250,000   (based on the valuation method used by the Company for its senior
executives) through a combination of stock option grants, restricted stock units, performance shares or other equity-based awards, cash-based long-term plans or other components as may be determined by the Compensation and Human Development
Committee of the Company s Board of Directors from time to time in its sole discretion. The Company may increase, but not decrease, the target value of your annual long term incentive compensation during the term of employment.  
      2  

3.4   Indemnification .  You shall be entitled throughout the term of
employment (and after the end of the term of employment, to the extent relating to service during the term of employment) to the benefit of the indemnification provisions contained on the Effective Date in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws of the Company (not including any amendments or additions after the Effective Date that limit or narrow, but including any that add to or broaden, the protection afforded to you by those provisions).  
 4.   Termination .  
 4.1   Termination for Cause .  The Company may terminate the term of employment and all of the Company s
obligations under this Agreement, other than its obligations set forth below in this Sections 4.1 and in Section 3.4, for  cause . Termination by the Company for  cause  shall mean termination because of your
(a) conviction (treating a nolo contendere plea as a conviction) of a felony (whether or not any right to appeal has been or may be exercised) other than as a result of a moving violation or a Limited Vicarious Liability, (b) willful
failure or refusal without proper cause to perform your material duties with the Company, including your material obligations under this Agreement (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental impairment),
(c) willful misappropriation, embezzlement or reckless or willful destruction of Company property having a significant adverse financial effect on the Company or a significant adverse effect on the Company s reputation, (d) willful
and material breach of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company having a significant adverse financial effect on the Company or a significant adverse effect on the Company s reputation, or (e) material and willful breach
of any of the covenants provided for in Sections 8 and 9. Such termination shall be effected by written notice thereof delivered by the Company to you and shall be effective as of the date of such notice; provided, however, that if (i) such
termination is because of your willful failure or refusal without proper cause to perform your material duties with the Company including any one or more of your material obligations under this Agreement or for intentional and improper conduct, and
(ii) within 30 days following the date of such notice you shall cease your refusal and shall use your best efforts to perform such obligations or cease such intentional and improper conduct, the termination shall not be effective. For purposes
of this definition of Cause, no act, or failure to act, on your part shall be considered  willful  or  intentional  unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable belief that such action or
omission was opposed to  
      3  

the best interest of the Company. The term  Limited Vicarious Liability  shall mean any liability which is based on acts of the Company for which you are responsible solely as a result
of your office(s) with the Company; provided that (x) you are not directly involved in such acts and either had no prior knowledge of such intended actions or, upon obtaining such knowledge, promptly acted reasonably and in good faith to
attempt to prevent the acts causing such liability or (y) after consulting with the Company s counsel, you reasonably believed that no law was being violated by such acts.  
 In the event of termination by the Company for cause, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law or
in equity, the Company shall have no further obligation to you other than (i) to pay Base Salary through the effective date of the termination of employment (the  Effective Termination Date ), (ii) to pay any Bonus for any year
prior to the year in which such termination occurs that has been determined but not yet paid as of the Effective Termination Date, (iii) to pay any unpaid Life Insurance Premium (as defined in Section 7.1) for any year prior to the year in
which such termination occurs, and (iv) with respect to any rights you have pursuant to any insurance or other benefit plans or arrangements of the Company (including under Section 7.2 hereof) (the items described in clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv), collectively, the  Accrued Obligations ). You hereby disclaim any right to receive a pro rata portion of any Bonus with respect to the year in which such termination occurs.  
 4.2   Termination by You for Material Breach by the Company and Termination by the Company Without Cause .  Unless
previously terminated pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement and unless a Disability Period shall be in effect, you shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Company, to terminate the term of employment under this
Agreement with an Effective Termination Date 30 days after the giving of such notice, if, at the time of the giving of such notice, the Company is in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that, with the
exception of clause (i) below, this Agreement shall not so terminate if such notice is the first such notice of termination delivered by you pursuant to this Section 4.2 and within such 30-day period the Company shall have cured all such
material breaches; and provided further, that such notice is provided to the Company within 90 days after the occurrence of such material breach. A material breach by the Company shall include, but not be limited to (i) the Company violating
Section 2 with respect to authority, duties, or place of employment and (ii) the Company failing to cause any successor to all or substantially all of the business and assets of the Company expressly to assume the obligations of the
Company under this Agreement.  
      4  

The Company shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to you delivered at least 60
days prior to the Effective Termination Date, to terminate your employment under this Agreement without cause, which notice shall specify the Effective Termination Date. If such notice is delivered on or after the date which is 60 days prior to the
Term Date, the provisions of Section 4.3 shall apply.    4.2.1  In the event of a termination of employment pursuant to this
Section 4.2 (a  termination without cause ), you shall receive Base Salary and a pro rata portion of your Average Annual Bonus (as defined below) through the Effective Termination Date. Your Average Annual Bonus shall be equal to the
average of the regular annual bonus amounts (including any such amounts that have been deferred under any plan or arrangement of the Company, but excluding the amount of any special or spot bonuses)(the  Regular Bonus ) in respect of the
two calendar years during the most recent three calendar years for which the Regular Bonus received by you from the Company was the greatest. In addition, if the Effective Termination Date occurs on December 31 of any performance year or
following the end of a performance year but prior to the date that the Bonus amount in respect of such year has been paid to you pursuant to Section 3.2, then for purposes of calculating your Average Annual Bonus, the unpaid Bonus in respect of
such year will be taken into account only if it would result in a greater Average Annual Bonus. Your pro rata Average Annual Bonus pursuant to this Section 4.2.1 shall be paid to you at the times set forth in Section 4.7.  
 4.2.2  In the event of a termination covered by Section 4.2 or 4.3 after the Effective Termination Date, you shall continue to
be treated like an employee of the Company for a period ending on the date which is twenty-four months after the Effective Termination Date if the Effective Termination Date occurs prior to the Term Date or twelve months after the
Effective Termination Date if the Effective Termination Date occurs on or after the Term Date (such date, the  Severance Term Date ). During such period you shall be entitled to receive, whether or not you become disabled
during such period but subject to Section 6, (a) Base Salary (on the Company s normal payroll payment dates as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Termination Date) at an annual rate equal to your Base Salary in effect
immediately prior to the notice of termination, (b) an annual Bonus in respect of each calendar year or portion thereof (in  
      5  

which case a pro rata portion of such Bonus will be payable) during such period equal to your Average Annual Bonus and (c) payment of the Life Insurance Premium for each full or partial
calendar year during the Severance Period (with respect to the calendar year in which the Effective Termination Date occurs, to the extent not otherwise paid under Section 4.2.1 or Section 7, and with respect to the calendar year in which
the Severance Term Date occurs, with the amount of such payment prorated to reflect the number of days during such calendar year that will elapse prior to the Severance Term Date). Except as provided in the next sentence, if you accept other
full-time employment during such period or notify the Company in writing of your intention to terminate your status of being treated like an employee during such period, you shall cease to be treated like an employee of the Company for purposes of
your rights to receive certain post-termination benefits under Section 8.2 effective upon the commencement of such other employment or the effective date specified by you in such notice, whichever is applicable (the  Equity Cessation
Date ), and you shall receive the remaining payments of Base Salary, Bonus and Life Insurance Premium pursuant to this Section 4.2.2 for the balance of the period when payments are due to you between the Effective Termination Date and the
Severance Term Date at the times specified in Section 4.7 of the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you accept employment with any not-for-profit entity or governmental entity, then you may continue to be treated like an employee of
the Company for purposes of your rights to receive certain post-termination benefits pursuant to Section 8.2 and you will continue to receive the payments as provided in the first sentence of this Section 4.2.2; and if you accept full-time
employment with any affiliate of the Company, then the payments provided for in this Section 4.2.2 shall immediately cease and you shall not be entitled to any further payments. For purposes of this Agreement, the term  affiliate 
shall mean any entity which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Company.  
 4.3   After the Term Date .  If, at the Term Date, the term of employment shall not have been previously terminated
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, no Disability Period is then in effect and the parties shall not have agreed to an extension or renewal of this Agreement or on the terms of a new employment agreement, then the term of employment shall
continue on a month-to-month basis and you shall continue to be employed by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, subject to termination by either party hereto on 60 days written notice delivered to the other party (which notice may
be delivered by either party at any time on or after the date which is 60 days prior to the Term Date). If the Company shall terminate the term of employment on  
      6  

or after the Term Date for any reason (other than for cause as defined in Section 4.1, in which case Section 4.1 shall apply), which the Company shall have the right to do so long as no
Disability Date (as defined in Section 5) has occurred prior to the delivery by the Company of written notice of termination, then such termination shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a  termination without cause 
under Section 4.2 and the provisions of Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 shall apply.    4.4   Release .  A condition
precedent to the Company s obligation to make or continue the payments associated with a termination without cause shall be your execution and delivery of a release in the form attached hereto as Annex A, as such form may be revised as required
by law, within 60 days following your Effective Termination Date. If you shall fail to timely execute and deliver such release, or if you revoke such release as provided therein, then in lieu of continuing to receive the payments provided for
herein, you shall receive a severance payment determined in accordance with the Company s policies relating to notice and severance reduced by the aggregate amount of severance payments paid pursuant to this Agreement, if any, prior to the date
of your refusal to deliver, or revocation of, such release. In this event, any such severance payments shall be paid in the form of Base Salary continuation payments at the annual rate equal to your Base Salary in effect immediately prior to your
notice of termination, with such amounts paid until your severance benefit has been exhausted.  
 4.5   Retirement .  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement relating to a termination without cause and
Disability, on the date you first become eligible for normal retirement as defined in any applicable retirement plan (i.e., age 65) of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (the  Retirement Date ), then this Agreement shall
terminate automatically on such date and your employment with the Company shall thereafter be governed by the policies generally applicable to employees of the Company, and you shall not thereafter be entitled to the payments provided in this
Agreement to the extent not received by you on or prior to the Retirement Date. In addition, no benefits or payments provided in this Agreement relating to termination without cause and Disability shall include any period after the Retirement Date
and if the provision of benefits or calculation of payments provided in this Agreement with respect thereto would include any period subsequent to the Retirement Date, such provision of benefits shall end on the Retirement Date and the calculation
of payments shall cover only the period ending on the Retirement Date.  
      7  

4.6   Mitigation .  In the event of a termination without cause under
this Agreement, you shall not be required to take actions in order to mitigate your damages hereunder, unless Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), would apply to any payments to you by the
Company and your failure to mitigate would result in the Company losing tax deductions to which it would otherwise have been entitled. In such an event, Section 4.8 shall govern. With respect to the preceding sentences, any payments or rights
to which you are entitled by reason of the termination of employment without cause shall be considered as damages hereunder. Any obligation to mitigate your damages pursuant to this Section 4.6 shall not be a defense or offset to the
Company s obligation to pay you in full the amounts provided in this Agreement upon the occurrence of a termination without cause, at the time provided herein, or the timely and full performance of any of the Company s other obligations
under this Agreement.    4.7   Payments .  Payments of Base Salary, Bonus and Life Insurance Premium required to
be made to you after any termination shall be made at the same times as such payments otherwise would have been paid to you pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 7 if you had not been terminated, subject to Section 12.17.  
 4.8   Limitation on Certain Payments .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:  
 4.8.1.  In the event it is determined by an independent nationally recognized public accounting firm that is reasonably acceptable
to you, which is engaged and paid for by the Company prior to the consummation of any transaction constituting a Change in Control (which for purposes of this Section 4.8 shall mean a change in ownership or control as determined in accordance
with the regulations promulgated under Section 280G of the Code), which accounting firm shall in no event be the accounting firm for the entity seeking to effectuate the Change in Control (the  Accountant ), which determination shall
be certified by the Accountant and set forth in a certificate delivered to you not less than ten business days prior to the Change in Control setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the Accountant s calculations (including any
assumptions that the Accountant made in performing the calculations), that part or all of the consideration, compensation or benefits to be paid to you under this Agreement constitute  parachute payments  under Section 280G(b)(2) of
the Code, then, if the aggregate present value of such parachute payments, singularly or together with the aggregate present value of any consideration, compensation or benefits to be paid to you  
      8  

under any other plan, arrangement or agreement which constitute  parachute payments  (collectively, the  Parachute Amount ) exceeds the maximum amount that would not give rise
to any liability under Section 4999 of the Code, the amounts constituting  parachute payments  which would otherwise be payable to you or for your benefit shall be reduced to the maximum amount that would not give rise to any
liability under Section 4999 of the Code (the  Reduced Amount  provided that such amounts shall not be so reduced if the Accountant determines that without such reduction you would be entitled to receive and retain, on a net
after-tax basis (including, without limitation, any excise taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code), an amount which is greater than the amount, on a net after-tax basis, that you would be entitled to retain upon receipt of the Reduced
Amount. In connection with making determinations under this Section 4.8, the Accountant shall take into account any positions to mitigate any excise taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code, such as the value of any reasonable
compensation for services to be rendered by you before or after the Change in Control, including any amounts payable to you following your termination of employment hereunder with respect to any non-competition provisions that may apply to you, and
the Company shall cooperate in the valuation of any such services, including any non-competition provisions.    4.8.2.  If the
determination made pursuant to Section 4.8.1 results in a reduction of the payments that would otherwise be paid to you except for the application of Section 4.8.1, the Company shall promptly give you notice of such determination. Such
reduction in payments shall be first applied to reduce any cash payments that you would otherwise be entitled to receive (whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise) and shall thereafter be applied to reduce other payments and benefits, in each
case, in reverse order beginning with the payments or benefits that are to be paid the furthest in time from the date of such determination, unless, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, you elect to have the reduction in
payments applied in a different order; provided that, in no event may such payments be reduced in a manner that would result in subjecting you to additional taxation under Section 409A of the Code. Within ten business days following such
determination, the Company shall pay or distribute to you or for your benefit such amounts as are then due to you under this Agreement and shall promptly pay or distribute to you or for your benefit in the future such amounts as become due to you
under this Agreement.    4.8.3.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the
time of a determination hereunder, it is possible  
      9  

that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for your benefit pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (each, an
 Overpayment ) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for your benefit pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an  Underpayment ), in each
case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accountant, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or you which the Accountant believes has a
high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for your benefit shall be repaid by you to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate
provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code; provided, however, that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which you are subject to tax under Sections 1 and
4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accountant, based on controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company
to or for your benefit together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.  
 4.8.4.  In the event of any dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with respect to the application
of this Section 4.8, you shall control the issues involved in such dispute and make all final determinations with regard to such issues. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 12.8 to the contrary, the Company shall promptly pay, upon
demand by you, all legal fees, court costs, fees of experts and other costs and expenses which you incur no later than 10 years following your death in any actual, threatened or contemplated contest of your interpretation of, or determination under,
the provisions of this Section 4.8.    5.   Disability .  
 5.1   Disability Payments .  If during the term of employment and prior to the delivery of any notice of termination
without cause, you become physically or mentally disabled, whether totally or partially, so that you are prevented from performing your usual duties for a period of six consecutive months, or for shorter periods aggregating six months in any
twelve-month period, the Company shall, nevertheless, continue to pay your full compensation through the last day of the sixth consecutive month of disability or  
      10  

the date on which the shorter periods of disability shall have equaled a total of six months in any twelve-month period (such last day or date being referred to herein as the  Disability
Date ), subject to Section 12.17. If you have not resumed your usual duties on or prior to the Disability Date, the Company shall pay you a pro rata Bonus (based on your Average Annual Bonus) for the year in which the Disability Date
occurs and thereafter shall pay you disability benefits for the period ending on the later of (i) the Term Date or (ii) the date which is twelve months after the Disability Date (in the case of either (i) or (ii), the  Disability
Period ), in an annual amount equal to 75% of (a) your Base Salary at the time you become disabled and (b) the Average Annual Bonus, in each case, subject to Section 12.17.  
 5.2   Recovery from Disability .  If during the Disability Period you shall fully recover from your disability, the
Company shall have the right (exercisable within 60 days after notice from you of such recovery), but not the obligation, to restore you to full-time service at full compensation. If the Company elects to restore you to full-time service, then this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all respects and the Term Date shall not be extended by virtue of the occurrence of the Disability Period. If the Company elects not to restore you to full-time service, you shall be entitled to
obtain other employment, subject, however, to the following: (i) you shall perform advisory services during any balance of the Disability Period; and (ii) you shall comply with the provisions of Sections 9 and 10 during the Disability
Period. The advisory services referred to in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence shall consist of rendering advice concerning the business, affairs and management of the Company as requested by the Chief Executive Officer or other
more senior officer of the Company but you shall not be required to devote more than five days (up to eight hours per day) each month to such services, which shall be performed at a time and place mutually convenient to both parties. Any income from
such other employment shall not be applied to reduce the Company s obligations under this Agreement.    5.3   Other
Disability Provisions .  The Company shall be entitled to deduct from all payments to be made to you during the Disability Period pursuant to this Section 5 an amount equal to all disability payments received by you during the
Disability Period from Worker s Compensation, Social Security and disability insurance policies maintained by the Company; provided, however, that for so long as, and to the extent that, proceeds paid to you from such disability insurance
policies are not includible in your income for federal income tax purposes, the Company s deduction with respect to such  
      11  

payments shall be equal to the product of (i) such payments and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is one less the maximum marginal rate of
federal income taxes applicable to individuals at the time of receipt of such payments. All payments made under this Section 5 after the Disability Date are intended to be disability payments, regardless of the manner in which they are
computed. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5, the term of employment shall continue during the Disability Period and you shall be entitled to all of the rights and benefits provided for in this Agreement, except that Sections 4.2
and 4.3 shall not apply during the Disability Period, and unless the Company has restored you to full-time service at full compensation prior to the end of the Disability Period, the term of employment shall end and you shall cease to be an employee
of the Company at the end of the Disability Period and shall not be entitled to notice and severance or to receive or be paid for any accrued vacation time or unused sabbatical.  
 6.   Death .  If you die during the term of employment, this Agreement and all obligations of the Company to make
any payments hereunder shall terminate except that your estate (or a designated beneficiary) shall be entitled to receive Base Salary to the last day of the month in which your death occurs and Bonus compensation (at the time bonuses are normally
paid) based on the Average Annual Bonus, but prorated according to the number of whole or partial months you were employed by the Company in such calendar year.  
 7.   Life Insurance .  During your employment with the Company, the Company shall (i) provide you with $50,000
of group life insurance and (ii) pay you annually an amount equal to two times the premium you would have to pay to obtain life insurance under a standard group universal life insurance program in an amount equal to $3,000,000 ( Life
Insurance Premium ) .  The Company shall pay you such amount no earlier than January 1 and no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which you are entitled to this amount. You shall be under no obligation to use the
payments made by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence to purchase any additional life insurance. The payments made to you hereunder shall not be considered as  salary  or  compensation  or  bonus  in
determining the amount of any payment under any retirement, profit-sharing or other benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.  
 8.   Other Benefits .  
      12  

8.1   General Availability .  To the extent that (a) you are
eligible under the general provisions thereof (including without limitation, any plan provision providing for participation to be limited to persons who were employees of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries prior to a specific point in time)
and (b) the Company maintains such plan or program for the benefit of its executives, during the term of your employment with the Company, you shall be eligible to participate in any savings plan, or similar plan or program and in any group
life insurance, hospitalization, medical, dental, accident, disability or similar plan or program of the Company now existing or established hereafter on a basis no less favorable to you than is provided to any other executive vice president of the
Company.    8.2   Benefits After a Termination or Disability .  After the Effective Termination Date of a
termination of employment pursuant to Section 4.2 and prior to the Severance Term Date or during the Disability Period, you shall continue to be treated like an employee of the Company for purposes of eligibility to participate in the
Company s health and welfare benefit plans other than disability programs and to receive the health and welfare benefits (other than disability programs) required to be provided to you under this Agreement to the extent such health and welfare
benefits are maintained in effect by the Company for its executives. After the Effective Termination Date or a termination of employment pursuant to Section 4.2 and prior to the Severance Term Date, you will continue to receive all other
benefits maintained in effect by the Company for its senior executives, such as financial services reimbursement. After the Effective Termination Date of a termination of employment pursuant to Section 4 or during a Disability Period, you shall
not be entitled to any additional awards or grants under any stock option, restricted stock or other stock-based incentive plan and you shall not be entitled to continue elective deferrals in or accrue additional benefits under any qualified or
nonqualified retirement programs maintained by the Company. At the Severance Term Date, your rights to benefits and payments under any health and welfare benefit plans or any insurance or other death benefit plans or arrangements of the Company
shall be determined in accordance with the terms and provisions of such plans. At the Severance Term Date or, if earlier, the Equity Cessation Date, your rights to benefits and payments under any stock option, restricted stock, stock appreciation
right, bonus unit, management incentive or other long-term incentive plan of the Company shall be determined in accordance with the terms and provisions of such plans and any agreements under which such stock options, restricted stock or other
awards were granted. However, consistent  
      13  

with the terms of the Prior Agreement, notwithstanding the foregoing or any more restrictive provisions of any such plan or agreement, if your employment with the Company is terminated as a
result of a termination pursuant to Section 4.2, then, subject to the application of any more favorable terms of the applicable stock option agreement, (i) all stock options to purchase shares of Time Warner Common Stock shall continue to
vest, through the earlier of the Severance Term Date or the Equity Cessation Date; (ii) except if you shall then qualify for retirement under the terms of the applicable stock option agreement and would receive more favorable treatment under
the terms of the stock option agreement, (x) all stock options to purchase shares of Time Warner Common Stock granted to you on or after February 17, 2010 (the  Term Options ) that would have vested on or before the later of the
Term Date and the Severance Term Date (or the date that is comparable to the Severance Term Date under any employment agreement that amends, replaces or supersedes this Agreement) shall vest and become immediately exercisable upon the earlier of the
Severance Term Date or the Equity Cessation Date, and (y) all your vested Term Options shall remain exercisable for a period of three years after the earlier of the Severance Term Date or the Equity Cessation Date (but not beyond the term of
such stock options); and (iii) the Company shall not be permitted to determine that your employment was terminated for  unsatisfactory performance  or  cause , in either case within the meaning of any stock option agreement
between you and the Company.    With respect to awards of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) held at the Effective Termination Date of a termination
of employment pursuant to Section 4.2, subject to potential further delay in payment pursuant to Section 12.17, the treatment of the RSUs will be determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement(s).  
 8.3   Payments in Lieu of Other Benefits .  In the event the term of employment and your employment with the Company
is terminated pursuant to any section of this Agreement, you shall not be entitled to notice and severance under the Company s general employee policies or to be paid for any accrued vacation time or unused sabbatical, the payments provided for
in such sections being in lieu thereof.    9.   Protection of Confidential Information; Non-Compete .  
 9.1   Confidentiality Covenant .  You acknowledge that your employment by the Company (which, for purposes of this
Section 9 shall mean Time Warner Inc. and its affiliates) will, throughout your employment, bring you into close  
      14  

contact with many confidential affairs of the Company, including information about costs, profits, markets, sales, products, key personnel, pricing policies, operational methods, technical
processes, trade secrets, plans for future development, strategic plans of the most valuable nature and other business affairs and methods and other information not readily available to the public. You further acknowledge that the services to be
performed under this Agreement are of a special, unique, unusual, extraordinary and intellectual character. You further acknowledge that the business of the Company is global in scope, that its products and services are marketed throughout the
world, that the Company competes in nearly all of its business activities with other entities that are or could be located in nearly any part of the world and that the nature of your services, position and expertise are such that you are capable of
competing with the Company from nearly any location in the world. In recognition of the foregoing, you covenant and agree:  
 9.1.1  You shall keep secret all confidential matters of the Company and shall not disclose such matters to anyone outside of the
Company, or to anyone inside the Company who does not have a need to know or use such information, and shall not use such information for personal benefit or the benefit of a third party, either during or after the term of employment, except with
the Company s written consent, provided that (i) you shall have no such obligation to the extent such matters are or become publicly known other than as a result of your breach of your obligations hereunder and (ii) you may, after
giving prior notice to the Company to the extent practicable under the circumstances, disclose such matters to the extent required by applicable laws or governmental regulations or judicial or regulatory process;  
 9.1.2  You shall deliver promptly to the Company on termination of your employment, or at any other time the Company may so
request, all memoranda, notes, records, reports and other documents (and all copies thereof) relating to the Company s business, which you obtained while employed by, or otherwise serving or acting on behalf of, the Company and which you may
then possess or have under your control; and    9.1.3  For a period of one year after the effective date of your retirement or
other termination by you of your employment with the Company or for one year after the Effective Termination Date of a termination of employment pursuant to Section 4, without the prior written consent of the Company, you shall not employ, and
shall not cause any entity of which you are an affiliate to employ, any person who was a  
      15  

full-time employee of the Company at the date of such termination of employment or within six months prior thereto, but such prohibition shall not apply to your secretary or executive assistant
or to any other employee eligible to receive overtime pay.    9.2.   Non-Compete Covenant .  
 9.2.1  During the term of employment and for the twelve-month period after (i) the effective date of your retirement or other
termination by you of your employment or (ii) the Effective Termination Date of a termination of employment pursuant to Section 4, you shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company: (x) render any services to, manage, operate, control, or act in any capacity (whether as a principal, partner, director, officer, member, agent, employee, consultant, owner, independent contractor or otherwise and whether or not
for compensation) for, any person or entity that is a Competitive Entity, or (y) acquire any interest of any type in any Competitive Entity, including without limitation as an owner, holder or beneficiary of any stock, stock options or other
equity interest (except as permitted by the next sentence). Nothing herein shall prohibit you from acquiring solely as an investment and through market purchases (i) securities of any Competitive Entity that are registered under
Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and that are publicly traded, so long as you or any entity under your control are not part of any control group of such Competitive Entity and such
securities, including converted or convertible securities, do not constitute more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting power of that entity and (ii) securities of any Competitive Entity that are not registered under
Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and are not publicly traded, so long as you or any entity under your control is not part of any control group of such Competitive Entity and such securities, including converted securities, do not
constitute more than three percent (3%) of the outstanding voting power of that entity, provided that in each case you have no active participation in the business of such entity.  
 9.2.2   Competitive Entity  shall be defined as a business (whether conducted through an entity (including its parent,
subsidiary, affiliate, joint venture, partnership or otherwise) or by individuals including employee in self-employment) that is engaged in any business activities that directly compete with (x) any of the business activities carried on by the
Company in any geographic location where the Company conducts business (including without limitation a Competitive Activity as  
      16  

defined below), (y) any business activities being planned by the Company or in the process of development at the time of your termination of employment (as evidenced by written proposals,
market research, RFPs and similar materials) or (z) any business activity that the Company has covenanted, in writing, not to compete with in connection with the disposition of such a business.  
 9.2.3   Competitive Activity  refers to business activities within the lines of business of the Company, including
without limitation, the following:      

(a) 
 The operation of domestic and international networks and premium pay television services (including the production, provision and/or delivery of programming to cable system operators, satellite distribution services,
telephone companies, Internet Protocol Television systems, mobile operators, broadband and other distribution platforms and outlets) and websites and digital applications associated with such networks and pay television services;    

(b) 
 The sale, licensing and/or distribution of content on DVD and Blu-ray discs, video on demand, electronic sell-through, applications for mobile devices, the Internet or other digital services; and    

(c) 
 The production, distribution and licensing of motion pictures and other entertainment assets, television programming, animation, interactive games (whether distributed in physical form or digitally) and other video
products and the operation of websites and digital applications associated with the foregoing.    
 9.3.   Injunctive Relief .  You acknowledge that your services are of a special, unique and extraordinary value to
the Company and that you develop goodwill on behalf of Time Warner. Because your services are unique and because you have access to confidential information and strategic plans of the Company of the most valuable nature and will help the Company
develop goodwill, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 9 are necessary to protect the value of the business of the Company and that a breach of any such non-competition covenant would result in irreparable and
continuing damage for which there would be no adequate remedy at law.  
      17  

The parties agree therefore that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 8, the Company may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to
any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof. The parties further agree that in the event the Company is granted any such

except as specifically contemplated in this Agreement, neither you, your legal representative nor any beneficiary designated by you shall have any right, without the prior written consent of the Company, to assign,
 
      19  

transfer, pledge, hypothecate, anticipate or commute to any person or entity any payment due in the future pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, and any attempt to do so shall be void and
shall not be recognized by the Company. The Company may not assign this Agreement or its rights or obligations hereunder except that the Company shall assign its rights together with its obligations hereunder in connection with any sale, transfer or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s business and assets, whether by merger, purchase of stock or assets or otherwise, as the case may be. Upon any such assignment, the Company shall cause any such successor expressly
to assume such obligations, and such rights and obligations shall inure to and be binding upon any such successor.  
 12.6   Amendments; Waivers .  This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded, cancelled, renewed or extended
and the terms or covenants hereof may be waived only by written instrument executed by both of the parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. The failure of either party at any time or times to require performance

jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the Company.  
 12.8   Resolution of Disputes .  Except as provided in the preceding Section 12.7, any dispute or controversy
arising with respect to this Agreement and your employment hereunder (whether based on contract or tort or upon any federal, state or local statute, including but not limited to claims asserted under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Title

with the rules and procedures of JAMS. Either party shall make such election  
      20  

by delivering written notice thereof to the other party at any time (but not later than 45 days after such party receives notice of the commencement of any administrative or regulatory proceeding
or the filing of any lawsuit relating to any such dispute or controversy) and thereupon any such dispute or controversy shall be resolved only in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.8. Any such proceedings shall take place in New
York City before a single arbitrator (rather than a panel of arbitrators), pursuant to any streamlined or expedited (rather than a comprehensive) arbitration process, before a non-judicial (rather than a judicial) arbitrator, and in accordance with
an arbitration process which, in the judgment of such arbitrator, shall have the effect of reasonably limiting or reducing the cost of such arbitration. The resolution of any such dispute or controversy by the arbitrator appointed in accordance with
the procedures of JAMS shall be final and binding. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the New York courts for this purpose. The
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the costs of arbitration (including reasonable attorneys fees and the fees of experts) from the losing party. If at the time any dispute or controversy arises with respect to this Agreement, JAMS is not
in business or is no longer providing arbitration services, then the American Arbitration Association shall be substituted for JAMS for the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.8. If you shall be the prevailing party in such
arbitration, the Company shall promptly pay, upon your demand, all legal fees, court costs and other costs and expenses incurred by you in any legal action seeking to enforce the award in any court.  
 12.9   Beneficiaries .  Whenever this Agreement provides for any payment to your estate, such payment may be made
instead to such beneficiary or beneficiaries as you may designate by written notice to the Company. You shall have the right to revoke any such designation and to redesignate a beneficiary or beneficiaries by written notice to the Company (and to
any applicable insurance company) to such effect.    12.10   No Conflict .  You represent and warrant to the
Company that this Agreement is legal, valid and binding upon you and the execution of this Agreement and the performance of your obligations hereunder does not and will not constitute a breach of, or conflict with the terms or provisions of, any
agreement or understanding to which you are a party (including, without limitation, any other employment agreement). The Company represents and warrants to you that this Agreement is legal, valid and binding upon the Company and the execution of
this Agreement and the performance of the Company s obligations hereunder does not and will not constitute a breach of, or conflict with the terms or provisions of, any agreement or understanding to which the Company is a party.  
      21  

12.11   Conflict of Interest .  Attached as Annex B and made part of
this Agreement is the Time Warner Corporate Standards of Business Conduct. You confirm that you have read, understand and will comply with the terms thereof and any reasonable amendments thereto. In addition, as a condition of your employment under

social security taxes and other ordinary and customary payroll deductions.    12.13   No Offset .  Neither you nor

shall be held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby; provided, however, that the parties shall negotiate in good faith with respect to equitable modification of the provision or application thereof held to be
invalid. To the extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, each party hereby waives any provision of law which renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.  
 12.15   Survival .  Sections 3.4, 8.3 and 9 through 12 shall survive any termination of the term of employment by
the Company for cause pursuant to Section 4.1. Sections 3.4, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 8 through 12 shall survive any termination of the term of employment pursuant to Sections 4.2, 4.3, 5 or 6. Sections 3.4, 4.6 and Sections 9 through 12 shall

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) and will be interpreted in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if at the time of your termination
of employment with the Company you are a  specified employee  as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and any related regulations or other pronouncements thereunder) and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits
otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such
payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided  
      23  

to you) until the date that is six months following your termination of employment with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code) and (ii) if any
other payments of money or other benefits due to you hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment
or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Company, that does not cause such an accelerated or additional
tax and does not reduce the value of such payments to you. To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to you under this Agreement constitutes  deferred compensation  under Section 409A of the Code, any such
reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to you in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). Each payment made under this Agreement shall be designated as a  separate payment  within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code. References in this Agreement to your termination of active employment or your Effective Termination Date shall be deemed to refer to the date upon which you have a  separation from service  with the Company
and its affiliates within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. The Company shall consult with you in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 12.17; provided that neither the Company nor any of its
employees or representatives shall have any liability to you with respect to thereto.  
      24  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Agreement the date first above written.
