NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Organization and Business  

Scio Diamond Technology Corporation (referred
to herein as the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada as Krossbow Holding Corp. on September 17, 2009. The Company s focus is on man-made diamond technology
development and commercialization. 

Going Concern  

The Company has generated little revenue to date and consequently
its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment and commercial launch of a new business enterprise. The Company
continues to develop its diamond technology while operating its factory to maximize revenue. The Company experienced a process
water leak in our facility in mid-December 2015 causing damage to our diamond growers and a temporary interruption in production.
The shutdown had a significant negative impact on revenue and delayed attainment of the Company s near-term business objectives.
The Company s insurance carrier provided it with $350,000 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, to cover the cost
of the business interruption. Due to the on-going negative impact of the shutdown on our business, our insurance carrier has provided
an additional $235,395 in extended business indemnity payments through September 30, 2016. 

These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has responded to these circumstances by implementing the
following strategies and actions: 

Continuing
                                         efforts with insurance carrier to cover the costs of the business interruption and any
                                         future adverse financial effects of the shutdown;    

Continuing
                                         efforts to solicit investment in the Company in the form of private placements of common
                                         shares to accredited investors not to exceed the shares authorized;    

Continuing
                                         efforts to solicit investment in the Company in the form of secured and unsecured debt;    

Continue
                                         to optimize production of recently expanded existing manufacturing capabilities to increase
                                         product revenues;    

Continuing
                                         to focus efforts on new business development opportunities to generate revenues and expand
                                         and diversify the customer base;    

Continuing
                                         development of white gemstone material to expand our product offerings and enhance our
                                         product marketability; and    

Continuing
                                         to explore strategic joint ventures and technology licensing agreements to expand Company
                                         revenue and cash flow.    

Historically,
these actions have been sufficient to provide the Company with the liquidity it needs to meet its obligations and continue as
a going concern. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will successfully implement these plans on a going forward
basis. If necessary, the Company will pursue further issuances of equity securities, and future credit facilities or corporate
borrowings. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern.  

Accounting Basis   

The accompanying unaudited financial statements
of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. 

9  

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly
the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 and the results of operations and cash
flows for the three and six month interim periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The interim amounts have not been audited,
and the results of operations for the interim periods herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be
expected for future periods or the year. The balance sheet at March 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited financial statements
at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included
in the Form 10-K Annual Report of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2016. 

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures, the Company uses the equity method of accounting for
investments in corporate joint ventures for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control
and is not the primary beneficiary. Significant influence typically exists if the Company has a 20% to 50% ownership interest in
the venture unless predominant evidence to the contrary exists. Under this method of accounting, the Company records its proportionate
share of the net earnings or losses of equity method investees and a corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balances.
Cash payments to equity method investees such as additional investments, loans and advances and expenses incurred on behalf of
investees, as well as payments from equity method investees such as dividends, distributions and repayments of loans and advances
are recorded as adjustments to investment balances. When the Company s carrying value in an equity method investee is reduced
to zero, no further losses are recorded in the Company s financial statements unless the Company guaranteed obligations of
the equity method investee or has committed additional funding. When the equity method investee subsequently reports income, the
Company will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously recognized. The
Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share  

Net loss per share is presented under two formats:
basic net loss per common share, which is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding excluding non-vested
restricted stock, during the period, and diluted net loss per common share, which is computed using the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, and the weighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding, computed using the treasury
stock method. Currently, for all periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share as the inclusion
of weighted average shares of non-vested restricted stock and common stock issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants would
be anti-dilutive. 

The following table summarizes the number of
securities outstanding at each of the periods presented, which were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share
as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive: 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

An allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable
is maintained for estimated losses from customers  failure to make payment on accounts receivable due to the Company. Management
determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including: (1) historical
experience, (2) aging of accounts receivable and (3) specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition
and the current credit worthiness of its customers. The Company has determined that an allowance was not necessary at September
30, 2016 or March 31, 2016. 

10  

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of average
cost or market. The carrying value of inventory is reviewed and adjusted based upon net realizable value, slow moving, obsolete
items and management s assessment of current market conditions. Inventory costs include material, labor, and manufacturing
overhead including depreciation and are determined by the  first-in, first-out  (FIFO) method. The components of inventories
are as follows: 

The Company maintains an inventory reserve for
instances where finished good inventory may yield lower than expected results. 

Property, Plant and Equipment  

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
is on a straight line basis beginning at the time it is placed in service, based on the following estimated useful lives: 

Leasehold improvements which are included in
facility fixed assets on the balance sheet are depreciated over the lesser of the remaining term of the lease or the life of the
asset (generally three to seven years). 

Expenditures for major renewals and betterments
that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred. The Company incurred total depreciation expense of $158,095 and $150,617 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $316,190 and $294,029 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Intangible Assets  

The Company s intangible assets consist
of its patent portfolio related to its diamond growing technology. These patents are considered definite-life intangible assets
and management reviews them for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. The Company has allocated values to the individual patents and is amortizing this value over the
remaining statutory lives of the individual patents ranging from 6.75 to 19.46 years. 

Stock-based Compensation  

Stock-based compensation expense for the value
of stock options is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model takes
into account implied volatility in the price of the Company s stock, the risk-free interest rate, the estimated life of the
equity-based award, the closing market price of the Company s stock on the grant date and the exercise price. The estimates
utilized in the Black-Scholes calculation involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. 

Revenue Recognition  

We recognize product revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability
is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when we have shipped finished product to
the customer. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our
part. The Company has an allowance for returns of $4,681 at September 30, 2016. This allowance has reduced reported revenues and
is considered an accrued expense in the balance sheet. The allowance was $8,681 at March 31, 2016. 

11  

For product sales to our
joint venture partners for further processing and finishing, we currently defer all revenues when products are shipped. We currently
recognize revenue at the earlier of when the joint venture partner sells the finished goods manufactured from our materials or
we are paid for our goods 

Concentration of Credit Risk  

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company had twenty-one different customers and two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.
At March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company had a receivable from Renaissance Created Diamond Company, LLC, a Florida
limited liability company ( RCDC ) of $174,413. The Company expects concentration of sales to key customers to continue
in the future. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

On May 28, 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606),  which affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into
contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance
supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , and most industry-specific guidance
throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The guidance also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35,
 Revenue Recognition Contract-Type and Production-Type Contracts . On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective
date of the pronouncement by one year. ASU 2014-9, as amended, is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 31, 2017. An entity is required to apply the amendments using one of the following two methods:
i) retrospectively to each prior period presented with three possible expedients: a) for completed contracts that begin and end
in the same reporting period no restatement is required, b) for completed contract with variable consideration an entity may use
the transaction price at completion rather than restating estimated variable consideration amounts in comparable reporting periods
and c) for comparable reporting periods before date of initial application reduced disclosure requirements related to transaction
price; ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendment recognized at the date of initial application
with additional disclosures for the differences of the prior guidance to the reporting periods compared to the new guidance and
an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. We are required to adopt ASU 2014-09, as amended, in the first quarter of
fiscal 2019, and we are currently assessing the impact of this pronouncement on our financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which requires management to
assess, at each annual and interim reporting period, the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after
the date that the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. The ASU is effective for the year ended March
31, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company has assessed the impact of this standard and does not believe that it will
have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Compensation-Stock Compensation . This guidance changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
award transactions, including: (1) Accounting and Cash Flow Classification for Excess Tax Benefits and Deficiencies, (2) Forfeitures,
and (3) Tax Withholding Requirements and Cash Flow Classification. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the
impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases . The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their
leases (other than short-term leases). The guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of
the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the
impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements. 

12  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , ( ASU 2015-11 ). This new guidance requires an entity to measure
inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Currently, entities measure inventory at the lower of cost and market.
ASU 2015-11 replaces market with net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course
of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged
for inventory measured under last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. ASU 2015-11 requires prospective adoption for inventory
measurements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years for public business entities.
Early application is permitted. ASU 2015-11 is therefore effective in our fiscal year beginning April 1, 2017. We are evaluating
the effect that ASU 2015-11 will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

There are currently no other accounting standards
that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company that will have a significant impact on the Company s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. 

NOTE 2   BUSINESS INTERRUPTION 

The Company experienced a water leak in our
production facility in mid-December 2015 that caused damage to our diamond growers and temporarily halted production. Product that
was growing at the time of the shutdown terminated early and was not marketable. This business interruption affected the Company s
operation through April 2016. The Company has received payments from our insurance carrier for coverage of this business interruption
and property losses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The Company s business interruption insurance includes extended
period indemnity coverage that pays for lost business income during an extended recovery period through October 2016. The Company
received $235,395 in payments under this extended coverage during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and accounted for these
payments as proceeds from insurance in other income. The Company anticipates that it will continue to receive payments under this
extended insurance coverage through October 2016. 

NOTE 3   INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The Company s intangible assets consist
of its patent portfolio. The assigned values of all patens are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining effective
lives of the patents. The following set forth the intangible assets at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016: 

Amortization expense for the quarter ending

NOTE 4   NOTES PAYABLE 

On December 16, 2014 the Company entered into
a Loan Agreement (the  HGI Loan Agreement ) and a Security Agreement (the  HGI Security Agreement ) with
Heritage Gemstone Investors, LLC ( HGI ) providing for a $2,000,000 secured non-revolving line of credit (the  HGI
Loan ). The HGI Loan, which is represented by a Promissory Note dated as of December 15, 2014 (the  HGI Note ),
matures on December 15, 2017. Borrowings accrue interest at the rate of 7.25% per annum. On December 18, 2014, $2,000,000 was drawn
on the HGI Loan. The Company utilized funds drawn on the HGI Loan to repay its existing indebtedness and to continue to fund its
ongoing operations. The HGI Loan Agreement contains a number of restrictions on the Company s business, including restrictions
on its ability to merge, sell assets, create or incur liens on assets, make distributions to its stockholders and sell, purchase
or lease real or personal property or other assets or equipment. The HGI Loan Agreement contains standard provisions relating to
a default and acceleration of the Company s payment obligations thereunder upon the occurrence of an event of default, which
includes, among other things, the failure to pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under the agreement when due;
failure to comply with specified agreements, covenants or obligations; cross-default with other indebtedness; the making of any
material false representation or warranty; commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings by or against the Company;
and failure by the Company to maintain a book net worth of at least $4,000,000 at all times. The Company s obligations under
the HGI Loan Agreement are not guaranteed by any other party. The Company may prepay borrowings without premium or penalty upon
notice to HGI as provided in the HGI Loan Agreement. The HGI Loan Agreement requires the Company to enter into the HGI Security
Agreement. Under the HGI Security Agreement, the Company grants HGI a first priority security interest in the Company s inventory,
equipment, accounts and other rights to payments and intangibles as security for the HGI Loan. 

During
the three and six months ending September 30, 2016 the Company recognized $36,702 and $73,758, respectively in interest expense
for the HGI Loan. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized $26,482 and $71,331 in interest
expense.  

During
the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not repay any principal on the HGI Loan. The outstanding
balance on the HGI Loan was $2,000,000 at March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, and is considered a non-current note payable.  

Also on December 16, 2014, the Company entered
into an agreement for the sale and lease of diamond growing equipment (the  Grower Sale-Lease Agreement ) with HGI
to allow for the expansion of current growers and the purchase of new growers. Pursuant to the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement, the
Company agreed to a sale-leaseback arrangement for certain diamond growers produced by the Company during the term of the Grower
Sale-Leaseback Agreement by which the Company will sell diamond growers to HGI and then lease the growers back from HGI. The term
of the Grower Sale-Leaseback Agreement is ten years. For the new and upgraded growers, the direct profit margin generated from
the growers as defined in the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement will be split between the Company and HGI in accordance with the Grower
Sale-Lease Agreement. The Grower Sale-Lease Agreement requires the Company to operate and service the growers, and requires HGI
to up-fit certain existing growers and to make capital improvements to the new growers under certain circumstances. At the end
of the Grower Sale-Leaseback Agreement, the Company takes ownership of the leased equipment. The Company will also have the right
to repurchase the leased growers upon the occurrence of certain events prior to the expiration of the Grower Sale-Leaseback Agreement. 

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016,
HGI advanced the Company $300,000 that funded improvements to our current growers that expanded manufacturing capacity in our production
facility and the Company considers this advance as notes payable ( Expansion Note ). The Company completed the grower
expansion and the assets were placed in service during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 

Payments to HGI for the Expansion Note are contingent
on the direct profit margin generated by the upgraded equipment and are expected to continue through August 2018. The Company has
estimated our expected payments to HGI for the direct profit sharing related to the Expansion Note and determined that the current
portion of this note payable is $98,999 at March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, which is considered a current liability. The
remaining $201,001 on the Expansion Note is considered a non-current note payable at March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016. During
the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $19,709 and $34,745, respectively in interest expense
for the Expansion Note. The Company did not recognize any interest expense on the Expansion Note for the three and six months ended
September 30, 2015. 

14  

During the three months ending September 30,
2016, the Company initiated an offering to accredited investors of up to $750,000 in convertible notes that will mature on September
15, 2017. The Company issued $105,600 in notes through September 30, 2016. The notes carry an interest rate of 8% and interest
accrues through maturity. The notes can be called by the Company at 101% plus accrued interest. The notes are convertible into
common shares of the Company at $0.14 per share. 

The Company has accounted for these convertible
notes as if they are conventional debt and includes them in its current liabilities on the balance sheet due to their maturities
being less than one year. During the three and six months ending September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $540 in interest expense
on these convertible notes. 

NOTE 5   CAPITAL LEASES 

As discussed in Note 4, the Company entered
in the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement with HGI on December 16, 2014. HGI has advanced the Company $200,000 for the purchase of new
grower equipment under the Sale-Leaseback Agreement. The sale and leaseback transaction occurred during the fiscal year ended March
31, 2016, and the Company put the assets into service during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company considers this advance
from HGI as a capital lease obligation. 

Payments to HGI under the capital lease are
contingent on the direct profit margin generated by the equipment as defined in the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement and will continue
until the lease obligation is satisfied at which time the Company will expense the sharing obligation until the ten year term of
the agreement expires. The Company has estimated our expected payments to HGI for the direct profit margin sharing related to the
equipment under capital lease and determined that the current portion of this capital lease obligation is $122,495 at March 31,
2016 and September 30, 2016, which is considered a current liability. The remaining $71,994 of the capital lease obligation is
considered a non-current obligation at March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016. During the three months and six months ended September
30, 2016, the Company incurred $13,113 and $23,137, respectively in interest expense for the capital lease. The Company did not
recognize any interest expense on the capital lease for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. 

NOTE 6   CAPITAL STOCK 

The authorized capital of the Company is 75,000,000
common shares with a par value of $ 0.001 per share. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company initiated an offering of up to 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.22 per share to accredited investors.
The Company has sold 1,179,000 shares and raised $227,776 net of cash commissions and fees of $31,604. In addition, as part of
the broker fee for this offering, the Company issued 82,530 warrants at an exercise price of $0.22. The Company valued these warrants
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and management has estimated these warrants had a value of $0.13 per warrant on the
date of the grant. The total value of the warrants issued was $10,729. The Black-Scholes model assumptions used were: Expected
dividend yield, 0.00%; Risk-free interest rate, 1.08%; Expected life in years, 5.0; and Expected volatility, 129.0%. 

The Company had 65,098,291 shares of common

NOTE 7   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company currently has one equity-based compensation
plan under which stock-based compensation awards can be granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants providing bona
fide services to or for the Company. The Company s 2012 Share Incentive Plan was adopted on May 7, 2012 (the  2012
Share Incentive Plan  or  Plan ) and allows the Company to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock pursuant

restricted or unrestricted stock awards, phantom stock, performance awards, other stock-based awards, or any combination of the
foregoing. The only awards that have been issued under the Plan are stock options. Because the Plan has not been approved by our
shareholders, all such stock option awards are non-qualified stock options.

Two members of our Board of Directors, Bern
McPheely and Lewis Smoak, each purchased $20,000 of convertible notes in our recent offering. 

NOTE 9   LITIGATION 

We are subject, from time to time, to various
claims, lawsuits or actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2016 there were no material outstanding
claims by the Company or against the Company. 

On May 16, 2014, the Company received a subpoena
issued by the SEC ordering the provision of documents and related information concerning various corporate transactions between
the Company and its predecessors and other persons and entities. The Company continues to cooperate with this inquiry. 

NOTE 10   INVESTMENT IN RCDC JOINT VENTURE 

On December 18, 2014 the Company entered into
an arrangement with Renaissance through the execution of a limited liability company agreement (the  LLC Agreement )
to form RCDC, pursuant to which the Company and Renaissance are each 50% members of RCDC. 

The LLC Agreement provides that RCDC is a manager-managed
limited liability company, and each of the Company and Renaissance will appoint one manager, with both such managers appointing
a third manager. The managers will manage the day-to-day operations of RCDC, subject to certain customary limitations on managerial
actions that require the consent of the Company and Renaissance, including but not limited to making or guaranteeing loans, distributing
cash or other property to the members of RCDC, entering into affiliate transactions, amending or modifying limited liability company
organizational documents, and entering into major corporate events, such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale. The arrangement
was entered into in order to facilitate the development of procedures and recipes for, and to market and sell, lab-grown fancy-colored
diamonds. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the arrangement will last three years, unless terminated earlier, with the option to automatically
renew for additional two-year periods. The Company made an initial $1,000 investment in RCDC and was granted a 50% equity stake.
RCDC has the right of first refusal to purchase diamond gemstones from the Company, including rough diamond preforms or processed
stones. RCDC purchases rough diamond material produced by the Company. RCDC then processes and finishes the rough gemstones into
retail-grade gemstones. RCDC then markets the finished stones to various retailers and other gemstone market participants. Profits
and losses generated by RCDC s operations are distributed between the Company and Renaissance according to the terms of the
LLC Agreement. 

17  

The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting
for its investment in RCDC. As such, the Company recognized $(8,372) and $18,363 as its proportional shares of RCDC s net
loss and income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as other income (loss). The Company recognized
$(28,741) and $34,702 as its proportional share of RCDC s net loss and income during the six months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. 

The financial performance of RCDC has not met
the Company s expectations since it was established. As a result, the Company believes this is a breach of the LLC agreement
and we are seeking to terminate the joint venture. The Company provided a termination notice to RCDC and Renaissance on October
31, 2016. Upon termination, the Company believes it will receive a portion of the inventory of RCDC that will meet or exceed the
book value of our investment and net receivable in RCDC. 

Rollforward of the
Company s ownership interest in the joint venture for the six months ended September 30, 2016:   

Selected financial
results for RCDC for the six months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:

31, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company was

GENERAL  

We were incorporated on September 17, 2009
in the State of Nevada under the name Krossbow Holdings Corporation ( Krossbow ). Krossbow did not implement its original
business plan and decided to acquire existing technology to seek to efficiently and effectively produce man-made diamond. In connection
with this change in business purpose, Krossbow changed its name to Scio Diamond Technology Corporation to reflect its new business
direction. 

In August 2011, the Company acquired certain
assets of Apollo Diamond, Inc. ( ADI ) consisting primarily of diamond growing machines and intellectual property
related thereto, for which the Company paid ADI an aggregate of $2,000,000 and also agreed to provide certain current and former
stockholders of ADI qualifying as accredited investors the opportunity to acquire up to approximately 16 million shares of common
stock of the Company for $0.01 per share. 

19  

In June 2012, the Company acquired substantially
all of the assets of Apollo Diamond Gemstone Corporation ( ADGC ), consisting primarily of lab-grown diamond gemstone-related
know-how, inventory, and various intellectual property, in exchange for $100,000 in cash and the opportunity for certain current
and former stockholders of ADGC qualifying as accredited investors to acquire up to approximately 1 million shares of common stock
of the Company for $0.01 per share. 

In December 2011, the Company began a build-out
of its Greenville, South Carolina production facility. Construction was largely completed in March 2012 and equipment was
moved from ADI s former facility in Massachusetts to South Carolina over the first calendar quarter of 2012. The Company
began initial production with ten diamond growing machines in July 2012. Our initial production was focused on industrial
cutting tool products supplied to a single customer. Since March 2013, the Company has expanded its product focus to include gemstone
diamond material. 

On December 16, 2014, the Company entered into
the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement with HGI. Pursuant to the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement, the Company agreed to a sale-leaseback arrangement
for certain diamond growers produced by the Company during the term of the Grower Sale-Leaseback Agreement by which the Company
will sell diamond growers to HGI and then lease the growers back from HGI. The direct profit margin generated from the growers
will be split between the Company and HGI in accordance with the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement. The Grower Sale-Lease Agreement requires
the Company to operate and service the growers, and requires HGI to up-fit certain existing growers and to make capital improvements
to the new growers under certain circumstances. The Company will also have the right to repurchase the leased growers upon the
occurrence of certain events. 

On December 18, 2014 entered into an arrangement
with Renaissance creating RCDC. The Company and Renaissance are each 50% members of RCDC. The arrangement was entered into in order
to facilitate the development of procedures and recipes for, and to market and sell, lab-grown fancy-colored diamonds. RCDC purchases
rough diamond material from the Company and processes the material into finished gemstones for sale to various retailers and other
gemstone market participants. Profits and losses generated by RCDC's operations are distributed between the Company and Renaissance
according to the terms of the LLC Agreement. 

Business Overview  

The Company s primary mission is the development
of profitable and sustainable commercial production of its diamond materials, which are suitable for known, emerging and anticipated
industrial, technology and consumer applications. The Company intends to pursue progressive development of its core diamond materials
technologies and related intellectual property that the Company hopes will evolve into product opportunities across various applications.
We believe these opportunities may be monetized though a combination of end product sales, joint ventures and licensing arrangements
with third parties, and through continued development of intellectual property. Anticipated application opportunities for the Company s
diamond materials include the following: precision cutting devices, diamond gemstone jewelry, power switches, semiconductor processors,
optoelectronics, geosciences, water purification, and MRI and other medical science technology. 

While the Company s product offering continue
to include industrial products, as of September 30, 2016 substantially all of the Company s production capacity is being
sold as gemstone materials. As of September 30, 2016, we had generated $4,070,170 in net revenue since inception from sales of
our diamond materials and licensing of our technology. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three
Month Period Ended September 30, 2015  

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, we recorded revenue of $242,066 compared to $236,292 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in revenue
was due to increased prices for gemstones sold during the quarter as the Company s product mix has shifted to white gemstones. 

20  

Cost of goods sold was $557,026 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 versus $461,279 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of goods sold includes direct
labor costs of $113,469 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $109,783 during the three months ended September 30,
2015. Depreciation expense of $155,957 and $147,799 was recorded in cost of goods sold during the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The overall increase in cost of goods sold is due to increased recognized manufacturing costs
as the Company s product sales shifted to white gemstone material. 

Gross deficit was $(314,960) for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 versus $(224,987) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Salary and benefit expenses recognized as general
and administrative expenses were $267,764 and $255,389 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This
increase of $12,375 is primarily the result of the Company recognizing $134,121 in non-cash stock based compensation during the
three months ended September 30, 2016, versus $123,466 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusting for the non-cash
stock based compensation results in recognized salary and benefit expenses of $133,643 and $131,923 for the three months ended
September 2016, versus 2015. 

Professional fees were $79,478 compared to $44,122
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The professional fees for the three months ended September
30, 2015 included reductions of $44,501 for payments made by our insurance carrier and other reversals of past professional fees.
Adjusting for these reductions, professional fees would be $79,478 and $88,623 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. This slight decrease is primarily due to reduced accounting expenses. 

Corporate general and administrative expenses
were $50,075 compared to $146,631 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease is due to
one-time executive relocation costs being incurred during the three months ending September 30, 2015. 

The other
components of our general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent between the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. Rent and facilities expenses were $34,133 and $40,961, respectively; marketing costs were $10,339 and $28,463,
respectively and depreciation and amortization expenses were $245,460 and $198,477, respectively.  

The Company
recognized $235,395 in business interruption proceeds from our insurance carrier related to the December 2015 factory shutdown
during the three months ending September 30, 2016. This has been recognized as other income.  

We have
continued to generate limited revenue to offset our expenses, and so we have incurred net losses. Our net loss for three month
period ended September 30, 2016 was $845,250, compared to a net loss of $809,588 during the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Our net loss per share for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was $(0.01) per share, compared to a net loss per share
of $(0.01) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 63,213,291 and
58,385,140, respectively, for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Six Month Period Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Six
Month Period Ended September 30, 2015  

During the six months ended September 30, 2016,
we recorded revenue of $427,127 compared to $408,467 during the six months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in revenue was
due to increased prices for gemstones sold during the period as the Company s product mix has shifted to white gemstones. 

Cost of goods sold was $1,104,175 for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 versus $876,646 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of goods sold includes direct
labor costs of $243,167 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and $216,075 during the six months ended September 30, 2015.
Depreciation expense of $311,916 and $288,467 was recorded in cost of goods sold during the six months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The overall increase in cost of goods sold is due to increased recognized manufacturing costs as the Company s
product sales shifted to white gemstone material. 

21  

Gross deficit was $(677,048) for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 versus $(468,179) for the six months ended September 30, 2015. 

Salary and benefit expenses recognized as general
and administrative expenses were $580,353 and $457,691 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This
increase of $122,662 is primarily the result of the Company recognizing $302,666 in non-cash stock based compensation during the
six months ended September 30, 2016, versus $187,967 during the six months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusting for the non-cash
stock based compensation results in recognized salary and benefit expenses of $277,686 and $269,724 for the six months ended September
2016, versus 2015. 

Professional fees were $220,566 compared to
$96,065 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The professional fees for the six months ended September
30, 2015 included reductions of $66,000 for payments made by our insurance carrier and other reversals of past professional fees.
Adjusting for these reductions, professional fees would be $220,566 and $162,065 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. This increase is primarily due to legal expenses. 

Corporate general and administrative expenses
were $125,670 compared to $232,178 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease is due to
one-time executive relocation costs being incurred during the six months ending September 30, 2015. 

The other components of our general and administrative
expenses were relatively consistent between the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Rent and facilities expenses were
$75,917 and $79,974, respectively; marketing costs were $13,410 and $56,646, respectively; and depreciation and amortization expenses
were $490,920 and $396,882, respectively. 

The Company recognized $235,395 in business
interruption proceeds from our insurance carrier related to the December 2015 factory shutdown during the six months ending September
30, 2016. This has been recognized as other income. 

We have continued to generate limited revenue
to offset our expenses, and so we have incurred net losses. Our net loss for six month period ended September 30, 2016 was $2,109,410,
compared to a net loss of $1,686,683 during the six months ended September 30, 2015. Our net loss per share for the six month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $(0.03) per share, compared to a net loss per share of $(0.03) for the six months ended September
30, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 62,831,990 and 57,464,860, respectively, for the six month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

At September 30, 2016, we had total assets of
$9,123,850, compared to total assets of $10,239,502 at March 31, 2016. We had cash of $9,947 at September 30, 2016 compared
to cash of $192,880 at March 31, 2016. 

Total liabilities at September 30, 2016 were
$4,059,137, compared to total liabilities of $3,595,821 at March 31, 2016. Total liabilities at September 30, 2016 were comprised
primarily of accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, deferred revenue, notes payable and capital lease obligations.
The increase in total liabilities is primarily due to our increased accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

The Company had negative working capital (defined
as current assets less current liabilities) of $(1,228,596) at September 30, 2016 versus $(462,543) at March 31, 2016. This decrease
in working capital resulted from the Company s increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the decrease in cash
during the six months ended September 30, 2016. 

Total shareholders  equity was $5,064,713
at September 30, 2016, compared to $6,643,681 at March 31, 2016. Shareholders  equity decreased $1,578,968 during the
period due to our operating net loss and was partially offset by additional paid in capital from common stock sold to investors
and from common stock issued as incentive compensation. 

22  

CASH FLOWS  

Operating Activities  

We have not generated positive cash flows from
operating activities. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities were $(516,309)
compared to $(1,211,607) for six months ended September 30, 2015. The net cash flow used in operating activities for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of a net loss of $(2,109,410) offset by depreciation and amortization of $802,836,
employee stock based compensation of $302,666, loss from joint venture of $28,741, increases in accounts receivable and deferred
revenue of $(29,091), increases in accounts payable of $196,551, increase in accrued expenses of $217,239, decrease in inventory
and deferred contract costs of $100,638, decrease in customer deposits of $(41,312), and net decreases in other current assets
and liabilities of $14,762. 

Investing Activities   

For the
six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities were $(0), and $(189,043), respectively.
These amounts consist of the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The cash used during the six months ended September 30,
2015 was due to the Company s capacity expansion program.  

Financing Activities   

We have
financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and debt securities. For the six month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $333,376 and $1,576,238, respectively, from financing activities.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES   

We expect that working capital requirements
will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, further issuances of securities, and future credit facilities
or corporate borrowings. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

As of March 31, 2016, our cash balance was $192,880
and as of September 30, 2016 our cash balance was reduced to $9,947. This reduction was due to our operating cash needs. Our cash
at September 30, 2016 is not expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the current fiscal year ending March 31,
2017. As of September 30, 2016, we had no additional lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements other than as described
in Item 1, Note 4. Generally, we have financed operations through September 30, 2016 through the proceeds of sales of our common
stock, convertible notes and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. The Company is pursuing additional issuances of equity
capital or debt to meet operating cash requirements. 

Additional issuances of equity or convertible
debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders. Such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not
available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations and could result in the shutdown of
operations. 

MATERIAL COMMITMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS  

On December 16, 2014, the Company entered into
an agreement for the sale and lease of growers with HGI. Pursuant to the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement, the Company agreed to a sale-leaseback
arrangement for certain diamond growers produced by the Company during the term of the Grower Sale-Leaseback Agreement by which
the Company will sell diamond growers to HGI and then lease the growers back from HGI. The direct profit margin generated from
the growers will be split between the Company and HGI in accordance with the Grower Sale-Lease Agreement. The Grower Sale-Lease
Agreement requires the Company to operate and service the growers, and requires HGI to up-fit certain existing growers and to make
capital improvements to the new growers under certain circumstances. The Company has the right to repurchase the leased growers
upon the occurrence of certain events. 

23  

On December 18, 2014 entered into an arrangement
with Renaissance creating RCDC. The Company and Renaissance are each 50% members of RCDC. The arrangement was entered into in order
to facilitate the development of procedures and recipes for, and to market and sell, lab-grown fancy-colored diamonds. RCDC purchases
rough Diamond material from the Company and processes the material into finished gemstones for sale to various retailers and other
gemstone market participants. Profits and losses generated by RCDC's operations are distributed between the Company and Renaissance
according to the terms of the LLC Agreement. The financial performance of RCDC has not met the Company s expectations since it was established.
As a result, the Company believes this is a breach of the LLC agreement and we are seeking to terminate the joint venture. The
Company provided a termination notice to RCDC and Renaissance on October 31, 2016. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

We have adopted various accounting policies
that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). We describe
our significant accounting policies in the notes to our audited financial statements filed with our Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2016. 

Some of the accounting policies involve significant
judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities. We consider these
accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience
and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions
we make, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates and could materially affect the carrying values of our
assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 

The following is a summary of the more judgmental
estimates and complex accounting principles, which represent our critical accounting policies. 

Revenue Recognition  

We recognize product revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability
is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when we have shipped finished product to
the customer. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our
part. The Company has an allowance for returns of $4,681 at September 30, 2016. This allowance has reduced reported revenues and
is considered an accrued expense in the balance sheet. The allowance was $8,681 at March 31, 2016. 

For product sales to our
joint venture partners for further processing and finishing, we currently defer all revenues when products are shipped. We currently
recognize revenue at the earlier of when the joint venture partner sells the finished goods manufactured from our materials or
we are paid for our goods. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of average
cost or market. The carrying value of inventory is reviewed and adjusted based upon net realizable value, slow moving and obsolete
items. Inventory costs include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead and are determined by the  first-in, first-out 
(FIFO) method. The components of inventories include raw materials and supplies, work in process and finished goods. 

24  

The Company has periodically experienced selling
prices that were lower than cost and as a result has recorded a lower of cost or market write down to the value of our inventory.
The estimation of the total write-down to inventory involves management judgments and assumptions, including assumptions regarding
future selling price forecasts, the estimated costs to complete and disposal costs. 

Property, Plant and Equipment  

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
is on a straight-line basis beginning at the time it is placed in service, based on the following estimated useful lives: 

Leasehold improvements are depreciated at the
lesser of the remaining term of the lease or the life of the asset (generally three to seven years). 

Expenditures for major renewals and betterments
that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred. 

Intangible Assets  

The Company s intangible assets consist
of its patent portfolio related to its diamond growing technology. These patents are considered definite-life intangible assets
and management reviews them for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. The Company has allocated values to the individual patents and is amortizing this value over the
remaining statutory lives of the individual patents ranging from 6.75 to 19.46 years. 

ITEM 3.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4.         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure controls and procedures refer to
controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. We applied our judgment in the process of reviewing these controls
and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding our control objectives. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Controls   

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.         LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We are subject, from time to time, to various
claims, lawsuits or actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2016, there were no material outstanding
claims by the Company or against the Company. 

In May 2014, the Company received a subpoena
issued by the SEC ordering the provision of documents and related information concerning various corporate transactions between
the Company and its predecessors and other persons and entities. The Company is fully cooperating with this ongoing inquiry. 

ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORS  

Not applicable (the Company is a smaller reporting company). 

ITEM 2.         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF
PROCEEDS

D, Rule 501(a), in reliance upon the exemption from registration under the 1933 Act provided by such Regulation D, Rule 506. The
sales were made in private transactions solely with such accredited investors, and we believe all actions necessary to comply with
such Regulation were taken.  The Convertible Notes bear interest at 8% annually, payable at maturity, mature on September
15, 2017, and principal and accrued interest are convertible into common stock at the conversion  price of $0.14 per share.

The Company represents
and warrants to Holder that: 

Section 2.1            Disclosure .
The Company, through its respective agents, has delivered to the Holder a copy of a Private Placement Memorandum, dated August
17, 2016 (including the documents incorporated by reference therein, the   Memorandum  ), relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all material respects, the general nature of the business of the Company.
This Note, the Memorandum (but as to information incorporated by reference therein, only such information to the extent that it
relates to the Company) and the documents, certificates or other writings delivered to the Holder by or on behalf of the Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the   Disclosure Documents  ), taken as
a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made .  Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Documents,
there has been no change in the financial condition, operations, business or properties of the Company except changes that individually
or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 2.2            Private
Offering by the Company . Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Notes or any similar securities
for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with,
any Person other than the Holder and other  accredited investors  as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D
of the Securities Act, each of which has been offered the Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither the Company nor anyone

and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or
levies imposed on them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent the same have become due and payable
and before they have become delinquent, provided that the Company need not pay any such tax, assessment, charge or levy if (a) the
amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by the Company on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings,
and the Company has established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company or (b) the
nonpayment of all such taxes, assessments, charges and levies in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. 

Section
3.           CONVERSION 

Section 3.1           At
any time prior to payment of all outstanding obligations owed to Holder based on the terms hereof, Holder may elect, by giving

(c)          any
representation or warranty made in writing by or on behalf of the Company or by any officer of the Company in this Note or in any
