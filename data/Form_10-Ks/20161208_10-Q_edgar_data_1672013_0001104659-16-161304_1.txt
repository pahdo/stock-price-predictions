   1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) and include the accounts of Acushnet Holdings Corp. (the  Company ), its wholly owned subsidiaries and a VIE in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
  Certain information in footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements has been condensed or omitted for the interim periods presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, the financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Company. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 is derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet for the year then ended. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year ended December 31, 2016, nor were those of the comparable 2015 period representative of those actually experienced for the full year ended December 31, 2015. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s prospectus, dated October 27, 2016, constituting part of the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-212116), filed with the SEC on October 31, 2016.  
     
   Acquisition   
     
  Acushnet Holdings Corp. was incorporated in Delaware on May 9, 2011 as Alexandria Holdings Corp., an entity owned by Fila Korea Co., Ltd.( Fila Korea ), a leading sport and leisure apparel and footwear company which is a public company listed on the Korea Exchange, and a consortium of investors (the  Financial Investors ) led by Mirae Asset Global Investments, a global investment management firm. Acushnet Holdings Corp. acquired Acushnet Company, our operating subsidiary, from Beam Suntory, Inc. (at the time known as Fortune Brands, Inc.) ( Beam ) on July 29, 2011 (the  Acquisition ).  
     
   Stock Split   
     
  On October 14, 2016, the Company effected a nine-for-one stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock and a proportional adjustment to the existing conversion ratios for its 7.5% convertible notes due 2021 ( convertible notes ), Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock ( Series A preferred stock ), and the exercise price for the common stock warrants and the strike price of stock-based compensation. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this stock split and adjustment of the common stock warrant exercise price, and convertible notes and redeemable convertible preferred stock conversion ratios.  
     
   Initial Public Offering

   Use of Estimates   
     
  The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders  equity, net sales and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
     
   Variable Interest Entities   
     
  VIEs are entities that, by design, either (i) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities independently, or (ii) have equity holders that do not have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the entity s expected losses, or the right to receive the entity s expected residual returns. The Company consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (ii) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive expected benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  
     
  The Company consolidates the accounts of Acushnet Lionscore Limited, a VIE which is 40% owned by the Company. The sole purpose of the VIE is to manufacture the Company s golf footwear and as such, the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810. The Company has presented separately on its consolidated balance sheets, to the extent material, the assets of its consolidated VIE that can only be used to settle specific obligations of its consolidated VIE and the liabilities of its consolidated VIE for which creditors do not have recourse to its general credit. The general creditors of the VIE do not have recourse to the Company. Certain directors of the noncontrolling entities have guaranteed the credit lines of the VIE, for which there were no outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,  2015. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the agreement governing the VIE, the Company is not required to provide financial support to the VIE.

   6. Derivative Financial Instruments   
     
   Common Stock Warrants   
     
  The Company classifies warrants to purchase common stock as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet as the warrants are free-standing financial instruments that may result in the issuance of a variable number of the Company s common shares. The warrants were initially recorded at fair value on grant date, and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date. The Company will continue to adjust the liability until the earlier of exercise of the warrants or expiration of the warrants occurs. Common stock warrants are recorded at fair value (Note 7) and included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the common stock warrants are recognized as other (income) expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations.  
     
  On July 29, 2011, the Company issued bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $168.0 million and common stock warrants to purchase an aggregate of 15,120,000 shares of the Company s common stock. On January 20, 2012, the Company issued $4.5 million of additional bonds and common stock warrants to purchase 406,431 shares of the Company s common stock (Note 5).  
     
  In July 2016, Fila Korea exercised its final annual call option to purchase 3,105,279 common stock warrants held by the holders of the bonds and exercised such warrants at the exercise price of $11.11 per

   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   
     
  share, or $34.5 million in the aggregate. The Company used the proceeds received from Fila Korea s exercise of the common stock warrants to redeem the outstanding bonds payable.  
     
   Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments   
     
  The Company principally uses financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The principal derivative financial instruments the Company enters into on a routine basis are foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.  
     
  Foreign exchange contracts are primarily used to hedge purchases denominated in select foreign currencies, thereby limiting currency risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the forecasted transactions, which do not exceed 24 months subsequent to the latest balance sheet date. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of all economic hedge transactions are immediately recognized in current period earnings. The primary foreign currency hedge contracts pertain to the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Korean won and the Euro. The gross U.S. dollar equivalent notional amount of all foreign currency derivative hedges outstanding as of September 30, 2016 was $353.6 million.  
     
  The counterparties to derivative contracts are major financial institutions. The Company assesses credit risk of the counterparties on an ongoing basis.  
     
  The fair values of foreign exchange derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:  

The effect of foreign exchange derivative instruments on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the consolidated statements of operations was as follows:

Table of Contents   
     
   ACUSHNET HOLDINGS CORP.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   

Based on the current valuation, the Company expects to reclassify a net loss of $13.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into cost of goods sold during the next 12 months.  
     
   7. Fair Value Measurements   
     
  Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under U.S. GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  
     
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015,  there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.  
     
  Rabbi trust assets are used to fund certain retirement obligations of the Company. The assets underlying the Rabbi trust are equity and fixed income exchange-traded funds.  
     
  Deferred compensation program assets and liabilities represent a program where select employees can defer compensation until termination of employment. Effective July 29, 2011, this program was amended to cease all employee compensation deferrals and provided for the distribution of all previously deferred employee compensation. The program remains in effect with respect to the value attributable to the employer match contributed prior to July 29, 2011.  
     
  Foreign exchange derivative instruments are forward contracts used to hedge currency fluctuations for transactions denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses the mid-price of foreign exchange forward rates as of the close of business on the valuation date to value each foreign exchange forward contract at each reporting period.  
     
  The Company categorizes the common stock warrants derivative liability as Level 3 as there are significant unobservable inputs used in the underlying valuations. The common stock warrants are valued using the contingent claims methodology.  
     
  The change in Level 3 fair value measurements was as follows:

9. Income Taxes   
     
  Income tax expense increased by $4.7 million, to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate ( ETR ) was (9.6%) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 24.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in ETR was primarily driven by an increase in indemnified tax obligations for periods prior to the Acquisition, offset by an increase in non-deductible transaction costs and changes to the geographic mix of earnings.  
     
  Income tax expense increased by $7.2 million, or 22.2%, to $39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s ETR was 44.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 58.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in ETR was primarily driven by a reduction of non-cash fair value losses on common stock warrants which are not tax effected, and a reduction in indemnified tax obligations for periods prior to the Acquisition, offset by an increase in non-deductible transactions costs and changes to the geographic mix of earnings.  
     
   10. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock   
     
  The Company has issued Series A preferred stock. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, authorized the Company to issue 1,838,027 shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock. Given that certain redemption features of the Series A preferred stock are not solely within the control of the Company, the Series A preferred stock is classified outside of stockholders  equity. The Series A preferred stock is only redeemable upon a change of control or the completion of a qualified initial public offering.  
     
 26   

Table of Contents   
     
   ACUSHNET HOLDINGS CORP.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   
     
  On May 6, 2016, the Company and each of the holders of the Series A preferred stock entered into an agreement requiring the mandatory conversion of the shares of the Series A preferred stock into fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company s common stock. This agreement was amended on September 5, 2016 to provide for the automatic conversion of a portion of the outstanding Series A preferred stock in connection with the sale of shares of the Company s common stock by the holders of the Series A preferred stock to Magnus. This automatic conversion of all outstanding Series A preferred stock  occurred prior to the closing of the Company s initial public offering. Upon conversion, all accrued but unpaid dividends on the shares of the Series A preferred stock was paid to each holder of the shares of the Series A preferred stock.  
     
   11. Equity Incentive Plans   
     
  The Company measures stock-based awards granted to employees based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The Company issues stock-based awards to employees with service-based vesting conditions and performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense for awards with only service-based vesting conditions is recorded using the straight-line method. Compensation expense for awards with service-based and performance-based vesting conditions is recorded on a straight-line method once the Company has determined that the likelihood of meeting the performance conditions is probable, which requires management judgment.  
     
  The Company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate, the Company has considered its historical experience to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures for service-based and performance-based awards. The impact of a forfeiture rate adjustment will be recognized in full in the period of adjustment, and if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the Company s estimate, the Company may be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation expense in future periods.  
     
  On January 22, 2016, the Company s board of directors adopted the Acushnet Holdings Corp. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan ( 2015 Plan ) pursuant to which the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares of common stock, restricted stock units, and other stock-based and cash-based awards to members of the board of directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors of the Company. The 2015 Plan was initially administered by the Company s board of directors and as of the Company s initial public offering, will be administered by the compensation committee (the board or compensation committee, as applicable, the  Administrator ). The Administrator has the authority to establish the terms and conditions of any award issued or granted under the 2015 Plan. The exercise price per share of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant and the term of the stock option may not be greater than ten years (except for incentive stock options granted to a 10% stockholder, which shall have an exercise price no less than 110% of the fair market value of the share of common stock on the date of the grant and a term not greater than five years). A total of 8,190,000 authorized shares of the Company s common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan.  
     
  On June 15, 2016, the Company s board of directors, in accordance with the 2015 Plan, approved a grant of multi-year restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and performance stock units ( PSUs ) to certain key members of management. The initial fair value of the grant was estimated at $45.8 million.  
     
  On August 9, 2016, the Company s board of directors approved an additional grant of multi-year RSU s and PSU s to certain key members of management. The initial fair value of the grants was estimated at $3.8 million.  
     
  The grants were made 50% in RSUs and 50% in PSUs. One-third of the RSUs vest on January 1 of each of 2017, 2018 and 2019, subject to the employee s continued employment with the Company, and the  
     
 27   

Table of Contents   
     
   ACUSHNET HOLDINGS CORP.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   
     
  PSUs cliff-vest on December 31, 2018, subject to the employee s continued employment with the Company and the Company s level of achievement of the applicable cumulative Adjusted EBITDA performance metrics (as defined in the applicable award agreements) measured over the three-year performance period. Each PSU reflects the right to receive between 0% and 200% of the target number of shares based on the actual three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA. The determination of the target value gave consideration to executive performance, potential future contributions and peer group analysis.  
     
  The RSUs and PSUs contain the right, but not the obligation, for the Company to repurchase up to 100% of the common stock that was issued in settlement of vested RSUs and PSUs, following an award holder s termination of employment for any reason. The repurchase right is at the sole discretion of the Company and can be exercised during the 60 day period following the first and second anniversary of any such termination of employment, provided that (i) no shares of common stock may be subject to repurchase unless they have been held by the award holder for at least six months and (ii) no repurchase right may be exercised upon or following the Company s initial public offering.  
     
  To date, the Company has not repurchased any shares issued in respect of restricted stock units or performance stock units. As of September 30, 2016, no RSUs or PSUs had vested. Remaining unrecognized compensation expense for non-vested RSUs and non-vested PSUs granted was $20.4 million and $22.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over the related weighted average period of 2.2 years.  
     
  The Company deemed the achievement of the 100% target three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA performance metric to be probable as of September 30, 2016. The Company will reassess the probability of achieving the three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA target at the end of each reporting period. The Company recorded compensation expense for the RSUs and PSUs of $3.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and compensation expense for the RSUs and PSUs of $4.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the majority of which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  
     
   12. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax   
     
  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses from foreign exchange derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities and pension and other postretirement adjustments.  
     
  The components of and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, were as follows:

   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   
     
   13. Net Income per Common Share   
     
  The following is a computation of basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. under the two-class method:  

The Company s potential dilutive securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, include Series A preferred stock, RSUs, PSUs, and convertible notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company s potential dilutive securities include Series A preferred stock, stock options, warrants to purchase common stock and convertible notes.  
     
  The following securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding as their impact was determined to be anti-dilutive:  

14. Segment Information   
     
  The Company s operating segments are based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) makes decisions about assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company has four reportable segments that are organized on the basis of product categories. These segments include Titleist golf balls, Titleist golf clubs, Titleist golf gear and FootJoy golf wear.  
     
  The CODM primarily evaluates performance using segment operating income. Segment operating income includes directly attributable expenses and certain shared costs of corporate administration that are allocated to the reportable segments, but excludes interest expense, net; EAR expense; gains and losses on the fair value of common stock warrants and other non-operating gains and losses as the Company does not  
     
 29   

Table of Contents   
     
   ACUSHNET HOLDINGS CORP.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   
     
  allocate these to the reportable segments. The CODM does not evaluate a measure of assets when assessing performance.  
     
  Results shown for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily those which would be achieved if each segment was an unaffiliated business enterprise. There are no intersegment transactions.  
     
  Information by reportable segment and a reconciliation to reported amounts are as follows:  

15. Commitments and Contingencies   
     
   Purchase Obligations   
     
  During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, finished goods inventory, capital expenditures and endorsement arrangements with professional golfers. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  Purchase obligations by the Company as of September 30, 2016 were as follows:

   ACUSHNET HOLDINGS CORP.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   
     
   Lease Commitments   
     
  The Company leases certain warehouses, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases.  
     
  The Company has an operating lease for certain vehicles that provides for a residual value guarantee. The lease has a noncancelable lease term of one year and may be renewed annually over the subsequent five years. The Company has the option to terminate the lease at the annual renewal date. Termination of the lease results in the sale of the vehicles and the determination of the residual value. The residual value is calculated by comparing the net proceeds of the vehicles sold to the depreciated value at the end of the renewal period. The Company is not responsible for any deficiency resulting from the net proceeds being less than 20% of the original cost in the first year and 20% of the depreciated value for all subsequent years. The Company believes that this guarantee will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Contingencies   
     
  In connection with the Company s acquisition of Acushnet Company, Beam indemnified the Company for certain tax related obligations that relate to periods during which Fortune Brands, Inc. owned Acushnet Company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s estimate of its receivable for these indemnifications is $9.9 million, of which $1.2 million is recorded in other current assets and $8.7 million is recorded in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  
     
   Litigation   
     
    Beam    
     
  A dispute has arisen between Acushnet Company and Beam with respect to approximately $16.6 million of value-added tax ( VAT ) trade receivables. These receivables were reflected on Acushnet Company s consolidated balance sheet at the time of the Company s acquisition of Acushnet Company. Acushnet Company believes that these VAT trade receivables are assets of the Company; Beam claims that these are tax credits or refunds from the period prior to the acquisition of Acushnet Company which are payable to Beam, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement that covers the sale of the stock of Acushnet Company. Beam has withheld payments in this amount which the Company believes are payable to Acushnet Company in reimbursement of certain other tax liabilities which existed prior to the acquisition of Acushnet Company. On March 27, 2012, Acushnet Company filed a complaint seeking reimbursement of these funds in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court Department, Business Litigation Section. Each party filed Motions for Summary Judgment, which motions were denied by the Court on July 29, 2015. Trial was conducted in early June, 2016.  On June 21, 2016, the Court ruled that Beam had a contractual right to the VAT trade receivables actually collected from Acushnet Company s customers prior to the closing of the Company s acquisition of Acushnet Company, but that Beam should pay $972,288 plus pre-judgement interest of $494,859 to the Company to compensate for amounts Beam withheld, but which were not collected from Acushnet Company s customers. The Company recorded the total value as other (income) expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Acushnet believes that the Court erred in its ruling and filed a Notice of Appeal on July 20, 2016.  
     
    Other Litigation    
     
  In addition to the lawsuit described above, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of their businesses and operations. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Consequently, the Company is unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of  
     
 31

   ACUSHNET HOLDINGS CORP.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   
     
  monetary loss, amounts covered by insurance or the financial impact that will result from such matters and has not recorded a liability related to potential losses.

   Overview   
     
  We are the global leader in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of performance-driven golf products, which are widely recognized for their quality excellence. Today, we are the steward of two of the most revered brands in golf Titleist, one of golf s leading performance equipment brands, and FootJoy, one of golf s leading performance wear brands. We own or control the design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products. In doing so, we are able to exercise control over every step of the manufacturing process.  
     
  Our target market is dedicated golfers, who are avid and skill-biased, prioritize performance and commit the time, effort and money to improve their game. We believe that dedicated golfers are the most consistent purchasers of golf products.  
     
  Our net sales are diversified by both product category and mix as well as geography.  Our product categories include Titleist golf balls, Titleist golf clubs, Titleist golf gear, and FootJoy golf wear and our product portfolio contains a favorable mix of consumable products, which we consider to be golf balls and golf gloves, and more durable products, which we consider to be golf clubs, golf shoes, golf apparel and golf gear.   Our net sales are also diversified by geography with a substantial majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 generated in five countries: the United States, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and Canada.  
     
  The following are financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

We have the following reportable segments: Titleist golf balls; Titleist golf clubs; Titleist golf gear; and FootJoy golf wear.  
     
  We were incorporated in Delaware on May 9, 2011 as Alexandria Holdings Corp., an entity owned by Fila Korea Co., Ltd. ( Fila Korea ), a leading sport and leisure apparel and footwear company which is a public company listed on the Korea Exchange, and a consortium of investors (the  Financial Investors ) led by Mirae Asset Global Investments, a global investment management firm.  We acquired Acushnet Company, our operating subsidiary, from Beam Suntory, Inc. (at the time known as Fortune Brands, Inc.) ( Beam ) on July 29, 2011 (the  Acquisition ).

  We completed an initial public offering of our common stock in November 2016.  See  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  for disclosures related to our initial public offering and other related transactions.  
     
  Following the pricing of our initial public offering, Magnus Holdings Co., Ltd. ( Magnus ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fila Korea, purchased from the Financial Investors on a pro rata basis 14,818,720 shares of our common stock, resulting in Magnus holding a controlling ownership interest of 53.1% of our outstanding common stock. The 14,818,720 shares of our common stock sold by the Financial Investors were received upon the automatic conversion of certain of our outstanding 7.5% convertible notes due 2021 (our  Convertible Notes ) and Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock ( Series A preferred stock ). The remaining outstanding Convertible Notes and Series A preferred stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock prior to the closing of the initial public offering.

    Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations    
     
  There have been no material changes to the key factors affecting our results of operations as described in our Prospectus dated October 27, 2016 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b).  
     
    Key Performance Measures    
     
  We use various financial metrics to measure and evaluate our business, including, among others: (i) net sales on a constant currency basis, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, (iii) Adjusted EBITDA margin and (iv) segment operating income.  
     
  Since 47% and 45% of our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were generated outside of the United States, we use net sales on a constant currency basis to evaluate the sales performance of our business in period over period comparisons and for forecasting our business going forward. Constant currency information allows us to estimate what our sales performance would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is calculated by taking the current period local currency sales and translating them into U.S. dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period. This constant currency information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of constant currency information may not be consistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies.  
     
  We primarily use Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, assess our consolidated operating performance and make decisions regarding pricing of our products, go to market execution and costs to incur across our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA in a manner consistent with the term  Consolidated EBITDA  as it is defined in the credit agreement, dated as of April 27, 2016, among Acushnet Holdings Corp., Acushnet Company, Acushnet Canada Inc. (the  Canadian Borrower ), Acushnet Europe Limited (the  UK Borrower ) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent, L/C issuer and swing line lender (our  credit agreement ).  Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. plus income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, the expenses relating to the Acushnet Company Equity Appreciation Rights Plan, as amended (the  EAR Plan ), share-based compensation expense, a one-time executive bonus, restructuring charges, certain transaction fees, indemnification expense (income) from Beam, (gains) losses on the fair value of our common stock warrants, certain other non-cash (gains) losses, net and the net income relating to noncontrolling interests in our FootJoy golf shoe joint venture.  Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. as a measure of our operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items, or affected by similar non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Our definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other  
     
 34   

Table of Contents   
     
  companies due to different methods of calculation. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp., see   Results of Operations.   
     
  We also use Adjusted EBITDA margin, which measures our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, because our management uses it to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, assess our consolidated operating performance and make decisions regarding pricing of our products, go to market execution and costs to incur across our business. We present Adjusted EBITDA margin as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it excludes the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. By presenting Adjusted EBITDA margin, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between different periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items, or affected by similar non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Our definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation.  
     
  Lastly, we use segment operating income to evaluate and assess the performance of each of our reportable segments and to make budgeting decisions.  
     
   Components of Results of Operations   
     
  There have been no material changes to the components of results of operations as described in our Prospectus dated October 27, 2016 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b).  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations.

    Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
     
   Net Sales   
     
  Net sales increased by $12.5 million, or 3.9%, to $332.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $319.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased by $7.0 million, or 2.2%, to $326.9 million. The increase in net sales on a constant currency basis was due to an increase of $5.6 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear across all categories and an increase of $5.2 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs driven by the new irons and putters introduced in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, respectively. The remaining increase in net sales was due to sales volume growth of products that are sold in regions outside the United States and that are not allocated to one of our four reportable segments. These net sales increases were offset by a decrease of $8.2 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls driven by a sales volume decline principally in the United States.  
     
  Net sales by reportable segment is summarized as follows:  

For further discussion of each reportable segment s results, see   Segment Results Titleist Golf Balls Segment,    Segment Results Titleist Golf Clubs Segment,    Segment Results Titleist Golf Gear Segment  and   Segment Results FootJoy Golf Wear Segment  results below.  
     
  Net sales information by region is summarized as follows:  

Net sales in the United States decreased by $1.2 million, or 0.7%, to $172.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $173.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease in net sales in the United States was due to a decrease of $7.6 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls largely offset by an increase of $5.5 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs and an increase of $1.0 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear.  Market conditions in the United States were soft in the third quarter and sales were also impacted by the reorganization efforts of a large off-course retail account.  
     
  Our sales in regions outside of the United States increased by $13.7 million, or 9.3%, to $159.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $146.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in such regions would have increased by $8.2 million, or 5.6%, to $154.4 million, driven primarily by an increase of $4.6 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear and an increase of $1.0 million in net sales of Titleist gear.  The remaining increase in net sales for regions outside of the United States was largely due to sales volume growth of products that are not allocated to one of our four reportable segments.

  More information on our sales by reportable segment and by region can be found in Note 14  Segment Information  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Gross Profit   
     
  Gross profit increased by $4.6 million to $162.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $157.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin decreased to 48.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 49.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross profit was driven by a $3.6 million increase in gross profit in FootJoy golf wear mainly due to higher average selling prices in the footwear category and a $2.4 million increase in gross profit in Titleist golf clubs driven primarily by increases in average selling prices of newly introduced irons, wedges, and putters.  These increases were partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in gross profit in Titleist balls as a result of lower sales volume as described above.  The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a slight loss on foreign currency exchange contracts compared to a gain in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.2 million to $139.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $144.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily attributable to the $9.7 million of expense related to our EAR Plan in 2015. Excluding the expense associated with our EAR Plan in 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $5.4 million to $139.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $134.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to a $4.5 million aggregate increase driven by a $4.4 million increase in bad debt expense primarily related to a large off-course retail account, a $2.8 million increase in transaction costs related to our initial public offering, and a $1.6 million increase in share-based compensation.  This was partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in professional tour costs and $1.1 million in associate incentive compensation accruals.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $1.0 million.  
     
   Research and Development   
     
  Research and development ( R D ) expenses increased by $1.1 million to $12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the expense associated with our EAR Plan in 2015, R D expenses increased by $1.6 million to $12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  As a percentage of consolidated net sales, R D expenses excluding expenses associated with our EAR Plan were 3.8%, up from 3.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Intangible Amortization   
     
  Intangible amortization expenses were $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, unchanged, compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Restructuring Charges   
     
  Restructuring charges were $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to no restructuring changes for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Interest Expense, net   
     
  Interest expense decreased by $1.9 million to $15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.   This decrease was primarily due to a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings as a result of our repayment of all amounts outstanding under, and termination of, our secured floating rate notes and certain of our former working credit facilities and termination of our former senior revolving credit facility, using certain borrowings under our credit agreement and cash on hand (the  Refinancing ), which was completed in July 2016, combined with lower average outstanding borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the redemption of $34.5 million of the principal of 
     
 38   

Table of Contents   
     
  our outstanding 7.5% bonds using the proceeds of the exercise of a portion of our outstanding common stock warrants in July 2016.  
     
   Other (Income) Expense, net   
     
  Other income increased by $2.5 million to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to other expense of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This change was primarily due to an increase of $2.4 million in indemnified tax obligations for tax periods prior to the Acquisition.  
     
   Income Tax Expense   
     
  Income tax expense increased by $4.7 million, to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 . Our effective tax rate ( ETR ) was (9.6%) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 24.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in ETR was primarily driven by an increase in indemnified tax obligations for periods prior to the Acquisition, offset by an increase in non-deductible transaction costs and changes to the geographic mix of earnings. 
     
   Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp.   
     
  Net income (loss) attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. increased by $7.8 million to a loss of $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of higher income from operations, an increase in other income, offset in part by higher income tax expense, as discussed in more detail above.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA   
     
  Adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.2 million to $27.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $24.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 8.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 7.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

  More information on our net sales by reportable segment and segment operating income can be found in Note 14  Segment Information  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Titleist Golf Balls Segment   
     
  Net sales in our Titleist golf balls segment decreased by $7.0 million, or 5.5%, to $119.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $126.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our Titleist golf balls segment would have decreased by $8.2 million, or 6.5%, to $117.9 million. This decrease was primarily driven by U.S. retail channel disruption caused by the bankruptcy of a large off-course retail account and the reorganization efforts of another large off-course retail account and a sales volume decline principally in the United States of our latest generation Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls, which were in their second model year.  
     
  Titleist golf balls segment operating income decreased by $1.9 million, or 10.1%, to $17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $19.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was driven by lower gross profit of $3.3 million primarily due to the sales decline as discussed above and higher bad debt expense of $1.9 million. This was offset in part by decreases of $1.2 million in professional tour costs, $1.0 million in marketing and promotional costs and $0.8 million in associate incentive compensation accruals.  
     
   Titleist Golf Clubs Segment   
     
  Net sales in our Titleist golf clubs segment increased by $7.0 million, or 10.4%, to $74.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $67.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our Titleist golf clubs segment would have increased by $5.2 million, or 7.7%, to $72.5 million. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in average selling prices on new irons, wedges, and putters, and higher sales volumes in irons. This increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices on our drivers and fairways as we transition into our next generation product.  
     
  Titleist golf clubs segment operating loss decreased by $0.9 million, or 10.6%, to a loss of $7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to higher gross profit of $2.4 million, largely driven by the net sales increase discussed above, offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in bad debt expense.  
     
   Titleist Golf Gear Segment   
     
  Net sales in our Titleist golf gear segment increased by $1.5 million, or 5.2%, to $30.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our Titleist golf gear segment would have increased by $0.9 million, or 3.1%, to $29.9 million. This increase was primarily due to sales volume growth in our travel gear and headwear categories.  
     
  Titleist golf gear segment operating income decreased by $0.1 million, or 6.4%, to $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Higher gross profit on the increased sales was offset by higher operating expenses to support our Titleist golf gear initiatives.  
     
   FootJoy Golf Wear Segment   
     
  Net sales in our FootJoy golf wear segment increased by $6.8 million, or 7.5%, to $97.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $90.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our FootJoy golf wear segment would have increased by $5.6 million, or  
     
 40   

Table of Contents   
     
  6.2%, to $96.5 million. This increase in 2016 was primarily due to higher average selling prices in our footwear category and sales volume growth in our apparel category.  
     
  FootJoy golf wear segment operating loss decreased by $0.2 million, or 29.1%, to a loss of $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating loss was driven by higher gross profit of $3.6 million largely offset by higher operating expenses.  The higher gross profit was driven by the increase in sales discussed above. The increase in operating expenses was driven by increases of $1.3 million in bad debt expense, $0.9 million in share based compensation expense and $0.7 million in expenses related to our FootJoy eCommerce initiative.  
     
    Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
     
   Net Sales   
     
  Net sales increased by $52.6 million, or 4.4%, to $1,235.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,182.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased by $55.7 million, or 4.7%, to $1,238.5 million. The increase in net sales on a constant currency basis was due to an increase of $25.9 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs driven by the new irons and wedges introduced in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, respectively, an increase of $23.0 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear across all categories, and an increase of $10.2 million in net sales of Titleist golf gear driven by sales volume growth in all categories. These net sales increases were offset partially by a decrease of $13.5 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls. The remaining increase in net sales was due to sales volume growth of products that are sold in regions outside the United States and that are not allocated to one of our four reportable segments.

  Net sales information by region is summarized as follows:  

Net sales in the United States increased by $8.2 million, or 1.3%, to $653.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $645.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in net sales in the United States was due to an increase of $14.6 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs and an

  increase of $5.2 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear, offset by a decrease of $12.1 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls.  
     
  Our sales in regions outside of the United States increased by $44.4 million, or 8.3%, to $581.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $537.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in such regions would have increased by $47.5 million, or 8.8%, to $584.7 million, driven by an increase of $17.9 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear, an increase of $11.4 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs, and an increase of $9.6 million in net sales of Titleist golf gear, offset slightly by a decrease of $1.4 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls.  The remaining increase in net sales was due to sales volume growth of products that are sold in regions outside the United States and that are not allocated to one of our four reportable segments.  
     
  More information on our sales by reportable segment and by region can be found in Note 14  Segment Information  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Gross Profit   
     
  Gross profit increased by $10.9 million to $621.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $610.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin decreased to 50.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 51.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross profit was largely driven by a $13.0 million increase in gross profit in Titleist golf clubs primarily due to increases in average selling prices and volumes of newly introduced irons, wedges and putters. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower gains on foreign currency exchange contracts compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $11.4 million to $445.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $457.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily attributable to the $30.7 million of expense related to our EAR Plan in 2015. Excluding the expense associated with our EAR Plan, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $20.1 million to $446.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $426.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to a $21.7 million aggregate increase primarily attributable to an increase of $11.2 million in transaction costs related to our initial public offering, a $7.5 million one-time executive bonus, a $4.7 million increase in bad debt expense primarily related to a large off-course retail account and additional marketing and promotional costs related to our new golf club product launches, FootJoy eCommerce and women s golf apparel initiatives.  This was partially offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in associate incentive compensation accruals.  This increase was offset by a $1.6 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  
     
   Research and Development   
     
  R D expenses increased by $1.3 million to $35.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $34.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the expense associated with our EAR Plan in 2015, R D expenses increased by $3.2 million to $35.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was driven by increases in employee related costs in the Titleist club and Titleist ball segments and additional staffing to support our Titleist gear initiative.  As a percentage of consolidated net sales, R D expenses excluding expenses associated with our EAR Plan were 2.9%, up slightly from 2.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Intangible Amortization   
     
  Intangible amortization expenses were $5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, unchanged, compared to $5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

   Restructuring Charges   
     
  Restructuring charges were $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to no restructuring changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Interest Expense, net   
     
  Interest expense decreased by $4.0 million to $44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   This decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the redemption of $34.5 million of the principal of our outstanding 7.5% bonds using the proceeds of the exercise of a portion of our outstanding common stock warrants in July 2015, as well as a scheduled repayment of $50.0 million of the principal on our secured floating rate notes in October 2015. In addition, the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the Refinancing which was completed in July 2016. 
     
   Other (Income) Expense, net   
     
  Other expense decreased by $8.6 million to $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to other expense of $10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This change was primarily due to a decrease in the recognized loss on the fair value of the common stock warrants from $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  In addition, income of $1.5 million was recorded during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 to recognize the legal judgment in favor of us associated with the Beam value-added tax dispute.  This net decrease in expense was offset in part by a decrease in the gain related to the adjustment of indemnified tax obligations for tax periods prior to the Acquisition from $4.4 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.6 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Income Tax Expense   
     
  Income tax expense increased by $7.2 million, or 22.2%, to $39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Our ETR was 44.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 58.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in ETR was primarily driven by a reduction of non-cash fair value losses on common stock warrants which are not tax effected, and a reduction in indemnified tax obligations for periods prior to the Acquisition, offset by an increase in non-deductible transactions costs and changes to the geographic mix of earnings. 
     
   Net Income Attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp.   
     
  Net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. increased by $26.4 million to $45.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of higher income from operations, a decrease in other (income) expense and interest expense, offset in part by higher income tax expense, as discussed in more detail above.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA   
     
  Adjusted EBITDA increased by $6.2 million to $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $185.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 15.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 15.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

   Titleist Golf Balls Segment   
     
  Net sales in our Titleist golf balls segment decreased by $15.4 million, or 3.6%, to $415.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $430.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our Titleist golf balls segment would have decreased by $13.5 million, or 3.1%, to $417.2 million. This decrease was primarily driven by U.S. retail channel disruption caused by the bankruptcy of a large off-course retail account and the reorganization efforts of another large off-course retail account and a sales volume decline of our latest generation Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls, which were in their second model year as well as a sales volume decline in our Pinnacle models. The decrease was offset slightly by a sales volume increase of our newly introduced performance golf ball models.  
     
  Titleist golf balls segment operating income decreased by $8.9 million, or 11.4%, to $69.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $78.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit of $12.5 million as a result of a golf ball mix shift from the Pro V1 franchise to the performance golf ball models, lower gains on foreign currency exchange contracts compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a $2.9 million expense related to the segment allocation of the one-time executive bonus, and an increase of $2.3 million in bad debt expense.  This was offset in part by decreases of $2.4 million in professional tour costs, $2.1 million in associate incentive compensation accruals, and $2.1 million in selling expenses mainly due to lower shipping and handling costs.  
     
   Titleist Golf Clubs Segment   
     
  Net sales in our Titleist golf clubs segment increased by $26.8 million, or 9.3%, to $314.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $287.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our Titleist golf clubs segment would have increased by $25.9 million, or 9.0%, to $313.7 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of our new Vokey Design wedges launched in the first quarter of 2016, our new iron series launched in the fourth quarter of 2015, our new Japan-specific VG3 clubs launched in the first quarter of 2016, and our new Scotty Cameron Select putters launched in the first quarter of 2016 and an increase in average selling prices on irons, wedges and putters. This increase was partially offset by lower sales volumes of our drivers and fairways, which were in their second model year.

Table of Contents   
     
  Titleist golf clubs segment operating income increased by $5.1 million, or 20.3%, to $30.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was driven by higher gross profit of $13.0 million on an increase in average selling prices on new irons, wedges and putters and the increased sales volumes as discussed above. This was offset in part by higher operating expenses primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million in marketing and promotional costs related to our new product launches, a $1.8 million expense related to the segment allocation of the one-time executive bonus and an increase of $0.8 million in bad debt expense.  
     
   Titleist Golf Gear Segment   
     
  Net sales in our Titleist golf gear segment increased by $9.7 million, or 9.2%, to $114.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $105.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our Titleist golf gear segment would have increased by $10.2 million, or 9.7%, to $115.4 million. This increase was due to sales volume growth in all categories of the gear business.  
     
  Titleist golf gear segment operating income increased by $2.7 million, or 21.6%, to $15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was driven by higher gross profit of $4.0 million on the increased sales as discussed above.  This was offset in part by an increase of $0.8 million in operating expenses to support our golf gear initiative and a $0.7 million expense related to the segment allocation of the one-time executive bonus.  
     
   FootJoy Golf Wear Segment   
     
  Net sales in our FootJoy golf wear segment increased by $21.7 million, or 6.4%, to $361.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $340.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our FootJoy golf wear segment would have increased by $23.0 million, or 6.8%, to $363.1 million. This increase was due to sales volume growth in our apparel and glove categories as well as an increase in average selling prices in our footwear category.  
     
  FootJoy golf wear segment operating income decreased by $5.9 million, or 18.9%, to $25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $31.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was attributable to lower gross margin and higher operating expenses.  The lower gross margin was primarily due to a decrease in gains on foreign currency exchange contracts compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption due to lower footwear production volume.  The increase in operating expenses was driven by an increase of $3.0 million in costs related to our FootJoy eCommerce and women s golf apparel initiatives, a $2.1 million expense related to the segment allocation of the one-time executive bonus and an increase of $1.3 million in bad debt expense.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Historically, our primary cash needs have been working capital, capital expenditures, servicing of our debt, interest payments on our Convertible Notes and 7.5% bonds, dividends on our Series A preferred stock, and pension contributions and, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, certain payments related to outstanding EARs under the EAR Plan. We have relied on cash flows from operations and borrowings under our former credit facilities and other credit facilities as our primary sources of liquidity.  Our remaining 7.5% bonds were redeemed in July 2016 and our Convertible Notes and our Series A preferred stock automatically converted into our common stock prior to the closing of our initial public offering.  
     
  We made $13.5 million of capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $10.0 million in the remainder of 2016, which we expect to fund from cash flows provided by operations. We expect the majority of capital expenditures in 2016 will be used for maintenance projects.  
     
  We made $24.4 million of payments related to outstanding EARs under our EAR Plan in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and expect to make approximately $2.3 million of payments related to outstanding EARs  
     
 45   

Table of Contents   
     
  under our EAR Plan in the remainder of 2016, which we expect to fund from cash flows provided by operations and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.  
     
  We expect our primary cash needs to be working capital, capital expenditures, servicing of our debt and pension contributions as well as payments of $2.3 million and $144.2 million due in the remainder of 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, respectively, in connection with payments related to outstanding EARs under the EAR Plan. We expect to rely on cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (as defined below) and local credit facilities as our primary sources of liquidity and to borrow under our delayed draw term loan  facility (as defined below) in the first quarter of 2017 to fund the payments due in connection with the final payout of the outstanding EARs under the EAR Plan.  
     
  The credit agreement entered into with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent, L/C issuer and swing line lender, provides for (i) a $275.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility, including a $20.0 million letter of credit sublimit, a $25.0 million swing line sublimit, a C$25.0 million sublimit for borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, a  20.0 million sublimit for borrowings by the UK Borrower and an alternative currency sublimit of $100.0 million for borrowings in Canadian dollars, euros, pounds sterling and Japanese yen (our  revolving credit facility ), (ii) a $375.0 million term loan A facility, which was used to repay amounts outstanding under floating rate notes, and (iii) a $100.0 million delayed draw term loan A facility (our  delayed draw term loan facility ).  The revolving credit and term loan facilities mature on July 28, 2021 and the delayed draw term loan facility expires on July 28, 2017 if not drawn.  As of September 30, 2016 we had $255.1 million of availability under our revolving credit facility after giving effect to $6.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and we had $66.2 million available under our local credit facilities. See  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 5   Debt and Financing Arrangements  for a description of our credit facilities.  
     
  Our liquidity is cyclical as a result of the general seasonality of our business. Our accounts receivable balance is generally at its highest starting at the end of the first quarter and continuing through the second quarter, and declines during the third and fourth quarters as a result of both an increase in cash collections and lower sales. Our inventory balance also fluctuates as a result of the seasonality of our business. Generally, our buildup of inventory starts during the fourth quarter and continues through the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand for our initial sell-in in the first quarter and reorders in the second quarter. Both accounts receivable and inventory balances are impacted by the timing of new product launches.  
     
  We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities, together with our cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our delayed draw term loan facility, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, subject to customary borrowing conditions. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is, however, subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, demand for our products, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties applicable to our business, as described in our Prospectus dated October 27, 2016 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the section  Risk Factors.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $85.7 million of unrestricted cash (including $12.8 million attributable to our FootJoy golf shoe joint venture). As of September 30, 2016, 97.4% of our total unrestricted cash was held at our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis. We are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and, subject to the cash payment of additional U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes, those funds could be repatriated, if necessary. At present, any additional taxes could be offset, in whole or in part, by available foreign tax credits. The amount of any taxes required to be paid and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation. We do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expenses as taxes have been provided for our undistributed foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested. We have repatriated, and intend to repatriate, funds to the United States from time to time to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs related to debt service requirements.

   Cash Flows   
     
  The following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:  

Cash Flows From Operating Activities    
     
  Cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, gain or loss on the fair value measurement of the common stock warrants, and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to changes in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses.  
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $122.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $109.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $12.2 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase related to change in our working capital, an increase in net income after adjustments for non-cash items, and lower income taxes paid which were offset by increases in cash payments related to our EAR Plan, our qualified pension plan, our supplemental executive retirement plan, and the first installment of a one-time executive bonus.  
     
    Cash Flows From Investing Activities    
     
  Cash flows from investing activities relate almost entirely to capital expenditures.  
     
  Net cash used in investing activities was $11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
    Cash Flows From Financing Activities    
     
  Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of principal payments on our former senior term loan facility, dividends paid on our Series A preferred stock, net borrowing under our former senior revolving credit facility and other credit facilities as well as the offsetting effects of cash received from the exercise of common stock warrants and our use of the proceeds from such exercise to redeem a corresponding amount of outstanding 7.5% bonds.  
     
  Net cash used in financing activities was $81.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $52.7 million. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the $30.0 million repayment of the former senior term loan facility, a net decrease in aggregate borrowings under our revolving credit and working credit facilities and other short-term borrowings and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the new credit facility.  
     
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
     
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in our Prospectus dated October 27, 2016 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b).  The Company has reviewed and determined that those critical accounting policies and estimates remain the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  We have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 1 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, such standards will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.  
     
    ITEM 3.                                Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
     
  We are exposed to various market risks, which may result in potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not believe we are exposed to material market risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents.  
     
    Interest Rate Risk    
     
  We are exposed to interest rate risk under our various credit facilities which accrue interest at variable rates, as described under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources Indebtedness  in our Prospectus dated October 27, 2016 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) and in  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 5  Debt and Financing Arrangements  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this report. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $747.6 million of outstanding indebtedness, including $385.1 million of borrowings at variable interest rates. A 1.00% increase in the interest rate applied to these borrowings would have resulted in an increase of $4.6 million in our annual pre-tax interest expense.  
     
  Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. We are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates for our floating rate debt. Our floating rate debt requires payments based on a variable interest rate index such as LIBOR. Therefore, increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt.  
     
    Foreign Exchange Risk    
     
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions outside the United States denominated in foreign currencies, which include, but are not limited to, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar. In addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the translation of the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.  
     
  We use financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The principal financial instruments we enter into on a routine basis are foreign exchange forward contracts. The primary foreign exchange forward contracts pertain to the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar. Foreign exchange forward contracts are primarily used to hedge purchases denominated in select foreign currencies. The periods of the foreign exchange forward contracts correspond to the periods of the forecasted transactions, which do not exceed 24 months subsequent to the latest balance sheet date. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

Table of Contents   
     
  The gross U.S. dollar equivalent notional amount of all foreign currency hedges outstanding at September 30, 2016 was $353.6 million, representing a net settlement liability of $19.7 million. Gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts that we account for as hedges offset losses and gains on these foreign currency purchases and reduce the earnings and shareholders  equity volatility relating to foreign exchange.  
     
  We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess potential changes in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts relating to a hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies covered by our contracts, the net settlement liability of $19.7 million would increase by $2.2 million resulting in a net settlement liability of $21.9 million.  
     
  The sensitivity analysis described above recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016 by replacing the actual foreign currency exchange rates at September 30, 2016 with foreign currency exchange rates that are 10% weaker rates for each applicable foreign currency. All other factors are held constant. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analysis also disregards the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.  
     
  The financial markets and currency volatility may limit our ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures. The counterparties to derivative contracts are major financial institutions. We assess credit risk of the counterparties on an ongoing basis.  
     
    Commodity Price Risk    
     
  We are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to certain materials and components used by us, our suppliers and our manufacturers, including polybutadiene, urethane and Surlyn for the manufacturing of our golf balls, titanium and steel for the assembly of our golf clubs, leather and synthetic fabrics for our golf shoes, golf gloves, golf gear and golf apparel, and resin and other petroleum-based materials for a number of our products.  
     
   Impact of Inflation   
     
  Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial.  
     
    ITEM 4.                                Controls and Procedures     
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and our Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  
     
  Our management, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on their evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, because the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below have not been remediated by the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents   
     
  These material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our remediation efforts are described below.  
     
   Material Weakness and Status of Material Weakness Remediation   
     
  As disclosed in our Prospectus dated October 27, 2016 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b), our management had previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We did not have in place an effective control environment with a sufficient number of accounting personnel with the appropriate technical training in, and experience with, GAAP to allow for a detailed review of complex accounting transactions that would identify errors in a timely manner. Further, we did not design and have in place formally documented and implemented processes and procedures to address the accounting for income taxes, derivatives, certain compensation and benefits, and functional currency, including internal communication protocols related to matters impacting income tax and benefit accounts. We also identified a lack of segregation of duties between the ability to create and post journal entries.  
     
  During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have continued the process of remediating the above material weaknesses, which has included numerous steps to enhance our internal control environment and address the underlying causes of the above material weaknesses. As part of this remediation process, we have enlisted the help of external advisors to provide assistance in the areas of financial accounting and tax accounting in the short term and are actively recruiting additional financial reporting personnel with technical accounting and financial reporting experience, formalized our accounting policies and procedures, and enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial statement close process. In addition, we have engaged an accounting firm to evaluate and document the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls and assist with the remediation and implementation of our internal controls as required. We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment, and we expect to continue our efforts to ensure the material weaknesses described above are remediated. However, the material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  As disclosed above under  Material Weakness and Status of Material Weakness Remediation,  there were changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II.                          OTHER INFORMATION    
     
    ITEM 1.                                Legal Proceedings     
     
  We are defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of our businesses and operations. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. We believe that there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. These actions are being vigorously contested.

    Item 1A.                                Risk Factors     
     
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors as described in our Prospectus dated October 27, 2016 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b).  
     
    ITEM 2.                                Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds     
     
    (a)                                        Sales of Unregistered Securities   
     
  In July 2016, Fila Korea exercised its call option on warrants held by certain existing securityholders to purchase 3,105,279 shares of common stock. Such warrants convert into common stock at the conversion price of $11.11 per share, or $34.5 million in the aggregate.  We used the proceeds received from this warrant exercise to redeem the remaining portion of our outstanding 7.5% bonds.  
     
  In August 2016, we granted an aggregate of 91,294 restricted stock units and an aggregate of 91,294 performance stock units to certain employees under the Acushnet Holdings Corp. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  
     
  The sales of the above securities were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, or Rule 701 promulgated under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.  
     
    (b)                                        Use of Proceeds   
     
  On October 27, 2016, our registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-212116) was declared effective for our initial public offering, and on November 2, 2016 we consummated our initial public offering consisting of 22,233,332 shares of our common stock for $17.00 per share. We did not sell any shares in the offering and all 22,233,332 shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering were sold by the selling stockholders for an aggregate offering price of $328.7 million.  J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC acted as lead book-running managers and as representatives of the underwriters for the initial public offering. Nomura Securities International, Inc. and UBS Securities LLC also acted as lead book-running managers. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Jefferies LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as joint book-running managers, and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Raymond James   Associates, Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and D.A. Davidson   Co. acted as co-managers.  
     
  We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders.  However, we incurred certain expenses in connection with the offering of $9.3 million. No offering expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates), persons owning 10 percent or more of our common stock or any other affiliates.  
     
    ITEM 3.                                Defaults Upon Senior Securities     
     
  None.  
     
    ITEM 4.                                Mine Safety Disclosure
