BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Business Activity:  Vet Online Supply Inc. (the "Company") is a Florida corporation incorporated on May 31, 2014. We are a US based reseller of premium veterinary supplies. The goal of "Vet Online Supply" is to provide the USA with value priced, superior quality products. Vet Online Supply sources our products through Concord Veterinary Supply. Concord, established in 1999, is now one of Canada s largest, independent suppliers of veterinary surgical and dental instruments. Our headquarters are located at 9612 West Hawthorne Crystal River, Florida 34428. 

During August 2015 the Company filed amended articles with the Florida Secretary of State to: 

-   

Set a series of preferred stock, each one share being convertible into one share of common stock and with no voting rights; 

-   

Set par value for each of the preferred and common stock at $0.001 per share. 

These financial statements include the retroactive application of this amendment. 

To date, our activities have been limited to formation, the raising of equity capital, and the development of a business plan. We have filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and are in the process of applying for a listing on the OTC Bulletin Board. We are now exploring sources of capital. In the current development stage, we anticipate incurring operating losses as we implement our business plan. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements 

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). They do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC. The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those audited financial statements included in Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three month ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Financial Statement Presentation:   The audited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").  

Fiscal year end:  The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts that differ from these estimates. 

Cash Equivalents:  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

Revenue recognition and related allowances:  Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is usually when title passes. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, net of trade discounts and sales taxes.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont d) 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  Accounts receivable are stated at the amount that management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Bad debts and allowances are provided based on historical experience and management s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable. Management evaluates past due or delinquency of accounts receivable based on the open invoices aged on due date basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are Nil. 

Inventories:  The Company is a reseller of premium veterinary supply products and as such will not maintain inventory as all items are directly drop shipped to customers when ordered and no inventory is held on hand as a result. 

Warranty:  The Company is a reseller of products which are shipped to our customers directly from the manufacturer and as a result, there are no costs that may be incurred by the Company under the terms of the limited warranty provided by the manufacturers directly to the purchasers. We do not provide any provisions for obligations which may arise under manufacturer s warranties and therefore at no time incur any warranty liabilities. 

Advertising and Marketing Costs:  Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and were $nil during the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 ($15,000   Mar 31, 2015) 

Income taxes:  The Company has adopted SFAS No. 109    Accounting for Income Taxes . ASC Topic 740 requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC Topic 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share : In accordance with ASC Topic 280    Earnings Per Share , the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

New Accounting Pronouncements:    

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

2.   

GOING CONCERN 

The Company has experienced net losses to date, and it has not generated revenue from operations, we will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations. 

3.   

DEFERRED OFFERING COSTS 

The Company has filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement to offer to the public up to 6,000,000 common shares at ten cents ($0.10) per share. The $12,500 in costs relating to such Registration Statement was applied to additional paid in capital as at March 31, 2016  .

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "should", "intends", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential", or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity or performance. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date that they were made. These cautionary statements should be considered with any written or oral forward-looking statements that we may issue in the future. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results, later events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

In this report unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to  common shares  refer to the common shares of our capital stock. 

The management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). 

As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our", and "our company" means Vet Online Supply, Inc., unless otherwise indicated. 

Corporate Information 

Vet Online Supply, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 31, 2014. We are a development stage company that engages in the sale of veterinary supplies for vet clinics of all sizes. We sell our products on the eCommerce web-based platform called OsCommerce, at our website www.vetonlinesupply.com. Our website gives our customers the ability to purchase veterinary supplies at affordable prices, making an order any time of the day, any day of the week. The Company s fiscal year end is December 31. 

Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, along with the accompanying notes.   

5 

At March 31, 2016 we had cash on hand totaling $25, 314(December 31, 2015 - $1,870), total assets of $25,491 (December 31, 2015 - $14,547) and liabilities of $94,481 (December 31, 2015 - $88,377).  While the company has raised  some proceeds under its Form S-1 offering, we must secure additional funds in order to continue our business. We continue to receive advances from our sole officer and director in order to pay expenses related to meeting our public reporting obligations  including legal, accounting and filing fees.  We may be required to secure additional financing to fund future filings. To date loans when required have been able to be secured from management of the Company, however we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional proceeds or secure additional loans in the future to cover our expenses related to maintaining our reporting company status (estimated at $25,000 for fiscal year 2016). Furthermore, there is no guarantee we will receive the required financing to complete our business strategies; we cannot provide any assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. If we are unable to accomplish raising adequate funds then it would be likely that any investment made into the Company would be lost in its entirety.  To date we have raised a total of $35,500 under our Form S-1 registration statement which calls for total proceeds of $600,000. 

Results of Operations 

For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 

We have generated minimal gross profit since inception, and an amount totaling $180, during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to $230 in gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Additionally, we continue to incur general and administrative costs related to our business plan and the filing requirements as a public issuer. Such general and administrative costs totaled $5,747 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 ($22,657   March 31, 2015). The reduction to costs is primarily related to a reduction in legal fees and other professional fees associated with the initial filing of our Registration Statement on Form S-1. Our net loss for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 totaled $5,760, including interest expenses of $193 in the period, as compared to $22,427 at March 31, 2015 with no comparative charges for interest expenses. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements, included herein. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 4.             CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our company is in the process of adopting specific internal control mechanisms to ensure effectiveness as we grow. We have engaged an outside consultant to assist in adopting new measures to improve upon our internal controls. Future controls, among other things, will include more checks and balances and communication strategies between the management and the board, once we are able to secure additional board members, to ensure efficient and effective oversight over company activities as well as more stringent accounting policies to track and update our financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
