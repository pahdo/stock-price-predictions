of this amendment. 

No changes have been made to the
Original 10-K other than to Item 7 and 8 and to the four certification exhibits. This amendment speaks as of the date of the Original
10-K, does not reflect events that may have occurred after the date of the Original 10-K and does not modify or update in any way the disclosures
made in the Original 10-K, except as required to reflect the revisions discussed above. This amendment should be read in conjunction
with the Original 10-K     and with our filings with the SEC filed subsequent to the filing of the Original
10-K. 

PART
II   

Item
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial
statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and certain other factors that may affect our future results.  The following discussion and analysis should be read
in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in  Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.    

This
annual report on Form 10-K contains or may contain forward-looking statements (collectively the  Filings ) and information
that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company's management as well as estimates and assumptions
made by Company's management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are
only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the filings, the words  anticipate,   believe, 
 estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms
and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company's management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements
reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and
other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.   

Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.   

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments,
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments,
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management's
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would
not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.   

Overview    

We
are a leading producer and distributor of raw fresh milk in China. We have two operating entities with an aggregate fresh milk
production capacity of approximately 386 tons per day. We also have 63 exclusive individual partners on June 30, 2016 with an
aggregate fresh milk production capacity of approximately 324 tons per day. We have four major customers, one of which is the
leading dairy company in China. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we terminated the contracts with certain customers
and entered into contracts with four new customers.   

We
were incorporated on December 22, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada.  We were formerly known as Trade Link.
On April 4, 2011, the Board of Directors of Trade Link filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the State of
Nevada and changed our name from Trade Link to China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc.    

On
January 28, 2011, we entered into a share exchange agreement by and among (i) Value Development Holding Limited, a British Virgin
Islands company ( Value Development ), (ii) Value Development s shareholders, (iii) us, and (iv) our former
principal stockholders.    Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Value Development s shareholders
transferred to us all of the shares of Value Development in exchange for the issuance of 35,998,000 shares of our common stock.
The shares issued to Value Development s shareholders in the Securities Exchange constituted approximately 87.80% of our
issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of and immediately after the consummation of the Securities Exchange. As a result
of the Securities Exchange, Value Development became our wholly owned subsidiary and Value Development s former principal
shareholders became our principal shareholders.    

On
January 28, 2011, Value Development completed the acquisition of Jiasheng Consulting Managerial Co., Ltd., a PRC company ( Jiasheng
Consulting ).  Jiasheng Consulting entered into a series of contractual agreements with Heilongjiang Zhongxian
Information Co., Ltd., a PRC company ( Zhongxian Information ), Mr. Zhengxin Liu, our Chief Human Resource Officer
and holder of 62% the of equity interest in Zhongxian Information, and Mr. Youliang Wang, our Chief Executive Officer and
holder of 38% of the equity interest of Zhongxian Information. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements, Jiasheng Consulting controls
all managerial power of Zhongxian Information.    The contractual arrangements include a shareholder voting
rights proxy agreement, exclusive consulting and services agreement, exclusive call option agreement and equity pledge agreement,
pursuant to which, Jiasheng Consulting shall provide exclusive and complete business support and technical and consulting service
to Zhongxian Information in exchange for an annual fee in the amount of Zhongxian Information s yearly net profits after
tax, and Zhongxian Information s stockholders pledged their rights, title and equity interest in Zhongxian Information as
security for the collection of such consulting and service fees provided in the equity pledge agreement.   

Zhongxian
Information was incorporated in China in January 2005 with registered capital of RMB 10,000,000 or $1,206,800 US Dollars.  In
February 2006, it acquired 99% of the registered capital of Heilongjiang Xinhua Cattle Industry Co., Ltd., a PRC company ( Xinhua
Cattle ), which was incorporated in China in December 2005 with registered capital of RMB 3,000,000 or $371,580 US Dollars.
Xinhua Cattle is located in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, in northeast China and is a livestock company that engages in cow
breeding and fresh milk production and distribution.  

On
November 23, 2011, Zhongxian Information acquired 100% of the equity interest of Shangzhi Yulong Cattle Co., Ltd., a PRC company
( Yulong Cattle ), in exchange for (i) issuance of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock, and (ii) a cash payment of
$4,396,000, to Yulong Cattle s former shareholders. Yulong Cattle was incorporated on December 4, 2007 under the laws of
the PRC. Yulong Cattle, located in Harbin, Heilongjiang, in northeast China, is a livestock company that engages in cow breeding
and fresh milk distribution, and primarily generates its revenue from the sale of fresh milk.   

On July
16, 2015, we transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Value Development to China Dairy Corporation Ltd., a Hong
Kong company ( China Dairy ), which is 60% owned indirectly by the Company through the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Hope Diary Holdings Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company ( Hope Diary ). These transactions involve
no consideration received or paid as Value Development and China Dairy are under common control with us and this transaction is
a restriction to our interests in Value Development. 

China
Dairy was newly incorporated in January 2015 and did not have any significant assets or liabilities, or business operations, which
is 100% owned by Company s PRC corporate advisor. Further, the sole shareholder transferred the 10,000 shares of China Dairy
to Value Development 60% and various shareholder and consultants of the Company 40% at HK$1.00 per share.   

The 40% of the 10,000
shares of China Dairy were transferred from the sole shareholder of China Dairy to the following entities at HK$1.00 per share,
which has direct or indirect relationship with the shareholder and consultants of the Company: 3% to Beijing Ruihua Future, 4%
to Donghe Group, 3% to Integral Capital, 20% to Dingxi Shanghai Fund and 10% to Zhiyuan International. Immediately after the transfer,
65,000 bonus shares were issued at no consideration for every existing share.  

Value
Development is the sole shareholder of Value Development Group Limited, which is the sole shareholder of Harbin Jiasheng Consulting
Managerial Co. Ltd. ( Jiasheng Consulting ), which is our subsidiary in China, with respect to which the operating
company, Zhongxian Information, is a variable interest entity. The effect of this transaction was to reduce the interest of ours
in its operating company by 40%. We use the China Dairy s offering price for the Proposed Offering to approximate the fair
value of the 40% stock granted to the shareholder and consultants.   

On September 16, 2015
our 60%-owned subsidiary, Jiasheng Consulting, exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of our operating subsidiary,
Zhongxian Information from its stockholders Zhengxin Liu and Youliang Wang, who are also the members of our Board of Directors,
for RMB10,000 (approximately $1,634). Prior to the acquisition, Jiasheng Consulting controlled Zhongxian Information through a
series of contractual agreements, which made Zhongxian Information a variable interest entity, the effect of which was to cause
the balance sheet and operating results of Zhongxian Information to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting in our financial
statements. As a result of the acquisition by Jiasheng Consulting of the registered ownership of Zhongxian Information, the balance
sheet and operating results of Zhongxian Information hereafter continues to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting as
its 100% owned subsidiary. On April 8, 2016, our 60% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited issued 84,906,541 CDI shares
at AUD $0.2 per share on ASX and raised total fund of AUD $16,981,308 (USD $13,021,267). After the IPO, our ownership was diluted
to 53.07%.  

Our current structure is set forth below:  

Factors
Affecting Our Results of Operations   

Our
operating results are primarily affected by the following present factors:   

Dairy
                                         Industry Growth. We believe the market for dairy products in China for the long term
                                         will grow rapidly, driven by China s economic growth, improved living quality and
                                         increased penetration of infant formula. Accordingly, we believe that the demand for fresh
                                         milk will increase rapidly.    

Production
                                         Capacity. Our revenue largely depends on our production capacity. The production capacity
                                         in this industry is determined by the variety, aging and number of adult cows. Accordingly,
                                         we acquired Yulong Cattle in November 2011 which increased our number of cows by 3,800
                                         and improved our production capacity by approximately 90 tons per day when acquired.

Raw
                                         Material Supplies and Prices. The per unit cost of fresh milk is affected by price
                                         volatility of our raw materials and feeding expenses in the China markets.  In
                                         response to the increased cost, we leased 16,666,750 square meters of grassland in October
                                         2011, 427,572 square meters grassland in February 2013, and 521,336 square meters of
                                         grassland in May 2015. We believe that the hay production of this grassland can satisfy
                                         our raw material demand and lower our feeding cost.    

Change
                                         of operation method. We disposed a large number of adult cows to local farmers, introduced
                                         distribution channel to them and receive up to 30% of the farmers  milk sales as
                                         a commission. It makes our performance is stably increased and we have enough production
                                         resources to feed more cows by ourselves. In addition, we signed with another 27 local
                                         farmers to feed 2,000 adult cows in May 2016 to increase our production resources.    

Sale
of Cows   

In
September 2011, August 2011, and June 2011, Xinhua Cattle sold 3,787, 5,635, and 2,000 of its cows to local farmers, respectively.
In November and December 2014, Yulong sold 3,714 and 2,995 cows to local farmers respectively. 3,500 of the cows sold in 2014
were purchased from outside unrelated parties for $4,550,000. The remaining cows sold were raised by Yulong. According to the
agreements signed with the local farmers in June 2011, the sales price will be collected over five years, with a minimum payment
of 20% of the sales price to be paid each year. The related receivable is recorded at its present value at a discount rate of
12%, which is commensurate with interest rates for notes with similar risk. The Company also entered into agreements with these
local farmers for a 30% commission of their monthly milk sales generated by the cows sold in exchange for the Company s
assistance in arranging for the sale of the milk.   

Pursuant
to the agreements signed in August 2011, September 2011, November 2014, and December 2014, the sales price will be collected in
monthly installments plus interest at 7% on the outstanding balance, over the remaining useful lives of the cows, which range
from one to eight years. Local farmers are required to pay 30% of monthly milk sales generated from the cows purchased by the
farmers. The 30% monthly payments are to be applied first to the monthly installment of principal for the cows sold and the balance
as commission income for the Company s assistance in arranging for the sale of the milk. The 30% monthly payments will continue
over the entire remaining life of the cows sold. While the 30% rate and the amount applied to monthly installments for the purchase
price of the cows remain the same, the amount of sales commission income will vary depending on total monthly milk sales and the
progress of repayments towards the purchase price.   

In
August 2015, Xinhua Cattle sold 200 cows to an outside party at a total price of RMB 160,000(US $24,861) including insurance of
RMB 100,000 (US $ 15,540). The cows had a net book value approximately $43,000 as of the disposal date, which includes cost basis
approximate $560,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $516,000. In May 2016, Xinhua Cattle sold 904 cows to an outside
party at a total price of RMB 3,616,000(US $561,854). The cows had a net book value approximately $564,000 as of the disposal
date, which includes cost basis approximate $1,147,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $583,000. In June 2016, Xinhua
Cattle also sold 500 female calves to an outside party at a total price of RMB 2,000,000 (US $310,760). The cost of these female
calves was approximate $322,000.   

In
November 2015, Yulong Cattle Sold 347 cows to an outside party at a total price of RMB 1,144,800 (US $177,879) including insurance
of RMB 104,100 (US $ 16,175). The cows had a net book value approximately $254,000 as of the disposal date, which includes cost
basis approximate $588,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $335,000. In May 2016, Yulong Cattle sold 331 cows to an
outside party at a total price of RMB 1,390,200 (US $216,009). The cows had a net book value approximately $324,000 as of the
disposal date, which includes cost basis approximate $709,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $385,000.

in payment to local farmers    

Due
to the significant increase in forage price, our payment to local farmers was increased as well during last twelve months. Before
March 2015, the payment which included feeding expense and forage cost was $51, $65, $75 and $115, respectively, which paid for
calve, pre-adult cow, young cow and adult cow per month. Since April 2015, such expenses were increased to $59, $76, $87 and $137,
respectively, paid for each type of cows. Since September 2015, such expenses were increased to $68, $87, $101 and $158, respectively.
In the end of September 2015, we terminated the agreements with the original 200 local farmers and signed with new 179 local farmers
near around Harbin city. However, it didn t stop the increase in forage price. Since November 2015, the feeding expenses
and forage costs were increased to $78, $96, $117 and $264 for each calve, pre-adult cow, young cow and adult cow, respectively.     

Results
of Operations    

Comparison
of years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015     

The
following table sets forth certain information regarding our results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.   

Revenues    

Our
revenue was primarily generated from sales of fresh milk and commissions on fresh milk sales by farmers to whom we sold cows.
We had total revenues of $101,091,303 for the year ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $34,756,137 or 52%, compared to
$66,335,166 for the year ended June 30, 2015. There are three main reasons caused such increase: 1). approximately $8,900,000
commission revenue generated from the total 6,709 milk cows disposed of by Yulong in November and December 2014 for the year
ended June 30, 2016; 2). Total average milk cows were increased from 9,831 to 16,459; 3). The milk sales price was increased
from $0.54 per kg to $0.59 per kg since November 2015 for approximate 72% of total milk sales.    

The
following table shows a breakdown of revenue from natural milk sales and sales commission, respectively:   

For
the year ended June 30, 2016, our revenue generated from natural milk sales was $81,604,871 which represented an increase of $33,163,366
or 68% compared to $48,441,505 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in the natural milk sales was primarily due to the
increased number of milk cows compared to the same period of prior year.   

The
following table sets forth information regarding the number of milk cows and the revenue per cow:  

The revenue
per milk cow increased to $4,958 for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $4,927 for the year ended June 30, 2015,
an increase of $31 or 1%. Although the selling price of fresh milk was increased from $0.54 per kg to $0.59 per kg since November
30, 2015 for approximate 72% of total milk sales, we terminated the feeding agreements with the original 200 local farmers in Qiqihaer
on September 25, 2015 and signed with 179 new farmers near to Harbin on September 29, 2015. The adult cows were transferred at
the end of September 2015 and it slightly affected the daily production because of the traveling and new living conditions. That s
the reason caused only 1% increase in revenue per milk cow. In addition, the cold weather and increase in average age of milk cow
slightly caused the decrease in production as well. The sales commissions from local farmers increased by $1,592,771 or 9%
to $19,486,432 for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $17,893,661 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The average quantity of milk
cows we now earn commission revenue increased by 7% or 1,033, to 16,517 for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 15,484 for the year
ended June 30, 2015 due to an addition from the sale of 3,714 and 2,995 milk cows by Yulong in November and December 2014, respectively,
and a deduction of 3,216 cows which had been fully depreciated from 13 farmers. The farmers started to pay the commission to Yulong
since April 2015. In addition, the daily production of the cows sold by Yulong is also higher than the cows sold by Xinhua due
to their younger age.  

Gross
profit    

Our cost of goods
sold consists of feeding food, feeding expenses and other direct production overhead which includes labor costs,
depreciation, lease, water   electricity, etc. Because we started to use the two new farms in Shuangcheng district and
Xiangfang District in Harbin, more direct production overhead was allocated to our costs of goods sold. In addition, the
direct feeding expenses and food costs paid to local farmers were increased from $115 per cow since March 2015 to $264 per
cow in November 2015. In December 2015, Xinhua entered into agreements with 179 local farmers to pay them additional feeding
cost of RMB 600 (US$93) for each young cow and adult cow, which were transferred to the farmers for raise at the beginning of
October 2015, for improving the feeding environment. The company paid 50% of the total amount RMB 6,795,000 (approximate
US$1,056,000) in December 2015 and the remaining 50% was paid in January 2016. Because all the young cows we paid for
additional feeding cost were transferred to adult cows, all the additional feeding cost of approximate $1,056,000 was
allocated to cost of goods sold. As a result, we have seen a decrease in our margins compared with the same period in
2015.  

The
cost per milk cow increased to $3,501 for the year ended June 30, 2016 which represented an increase of $1,443 or 70% compared
to $2,058 for the year ended June 30, 2015. We described the reason for the increase as above.  

Gross
profit margin    

Our gross profit
margin was 43.0% for the year ended June 30, 2016 which decreased by 26.5% from the year ended June 30, 2015. The main reason for
such a decrease was mainly due to the increase in feeding and food cost and directly production overhead.   

Operating
expenses     

Our
operating expenses sharply increased to $43,803,797 for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1,930,226 for the year ended June 30,
2015, an increase of $41,873,531 or 2,169%. Our operating expenses primarily consist of human resource costs, depreciation, professional
fees associated with filings required by the securities laws of the United States, consulting fees for a Chinese financial advisory
company and business taxes, etc. We incurred total of $950,302 and $ 1,002,045 in business taxes and VAT for the year ended June
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We classified these business taxes and VAT as selling expenses. As we discussed above, we had
been listed on ASX main board and were restructured since July 2015 and lose the interest of our operating company by 40%. We
treated the reduce of our interest by 40% as a stock compensation to our shareholders and consultants for a total of $37,762,400
it was recorded under our G A expenses. This is the main reason that caused such sharp increase in our operating expenses.
In addition, because our two new farms in Harbin were started to be used for the year ended June 30, 2016, the expenses, such
as human costs, depreciation, lease and water   electricity, incurred for our sales and admin departments for these two farms
were recorded as our operating expenses. That s another reason caused the increase in our operating expenses for the year
ended June 30, 2016 by comparing with the same period in 2015.  

Operating
income (loss)    

As
a result of the foregoing, we had operating loss of $338,717 for the year ended June 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $44,514,321,
as compared to operating income of $44,175,604 for the year ended June 30, 2015.   

Non-operating
income (expenses)    

For
the year ended June 30, 2016, non-operating income consists primarily of interest income of $588,822 earned on the outstanding
notes receivable from the farmers and other non-operating income of $174,802 which mainly consists of bank interest earned. Non-operating
expenses consist of the loss on the disposal of immature and mature biological assets of $224,957. For the year ended June 30,
2015, non-operating income consists primarily of interest income of $618,263 earned on the outstanding notes receivable from the
farmers and other non-operating income of $226,543 which mainly consists of bank interest earned. Non-operating expenses consist
of the loss on the disposal of mature biological assets of $1,104,345.   

Net
Income    

Xinhua
Cattle and Yulong Cattle are entitled to a tax exemption for the full Enterprise Income Tax in China due to a government tax preference
policy for the dairy farming industry. Zhongxian Information is subject to an Enterprise Income Tax of 25% and files its own tax
returns before January 16, 2015. On January 16, 2015, Zhongxian Information received a tax exemption notice from Harbin National
Tax Bureau on its investment income from its subsidiaries. Jiasheng Consulting (the  WFOE ) is subject to an Enterprise
Income Tax at 25% and files its own tax return before September 16, 2015. On September 16, 2015, Jiasheng Consulting purchased
all of the registered equity of Zhongxian Information and the VIE structure was terminated. Under China tax law, Jiasheng Consulting
is exempt from income tax on its investment income since September 16, 2015. The provision for income taxes was $2,403,996 and
$10,968,816 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily representing the enterprise income tax on the
income of Zhongxian Information. Net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests was $(2,204,046) and $32,947,249 for the years
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which represented a decrease in $35,151,295 or 107%. Originally we own 99% of Xinhua
Cattle s shares and our non-controlling interest is only 1% of Xinhua s net income. On July 16, 2015, as we transferred
100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Value Development to China Dairy, which is 60% owned indirectly by us through our
wholly owned subsidiary, Hope Diary. The effect of this transaction was to reduce the interest in our operating company by 40%.
In addition, on April 8, 2016, our 60% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited issued 84,906,541 CDI shares at AUD $0.2
per share on ASX and after the IPO, our ownership was diluted to 53.07%. As a result, net income attributed to the non-controlling
shareholders was increased from 1% to 46.93%. $16,641,448 and $355,982 was attributed to non-controlling interest for the years
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net income (loss) attributable to the common stockholders of the Company was $(18,845,494)
representing $(0.35) per share and $32,591,269 representing $0.61 per share for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Foreign
Currency Translation Adjustment    

Our
reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our local currency, Renminbi, is our functional currency. All asset and liability accounts
have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts have been translated
at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. Statements of income and other
comprehensive income and cash flows have been translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented. Adjustments
resulting from the translation of our consolidated financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction
gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency
translation adjustments of $(11,711,703) and $560,995, respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in
the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income (loss), respectively.   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of June 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no bank debt but amounts owed to shareholders of $1,672,707 and $937,524, respectively. The
amounts due to our stockholders were principally for the professional fees incurred for being a reporting company in the United
States and also will be in the Australian stock exchange from our stockholders  personal bank accounts because of the restriction
of official bank transfers abroad by the Bank of China. At the same time, we had $30,780,198 and $54,145,781 in cash at June 30,
2016 and 2015 as well as working capital of $55,157,784 and $64,685,249, respectively.  

Operating
activities    

During
the year ended June 30, 2016, our operating activities provided $26,179,444 in net cash, compared to $12,491,180 during the year
ended June 30, 2015. The net cash provided in the year ended June 30, 2016 was significantly higher than our net income (loss)
primarily due to the increase in deferred income tax liabilities of $2,403,996, depreciation on fixed assets and biological properties
of $4,828,085 and amortization on lease of $1,789,248 and the stock compensation for shareholders and consultants of $37,762,400.
However, the increase in accounts receivable of $18,408,219 caused the decrease in cash. The net cash provided in the year ended
June 30, 2015 was much less than the net income primarily due to the increase in the deferred income tax liabilities of $10,968,816
and prepayment for the lease of the two new farms of total $33,431,988.   

Investing
activities    

During the year ended
June 30, 2016, our investing activities provided a cash outflow of $58,678,207 compared with a cash outflow of $17,186,113 for
the year ended June 30, 2015. The food costs and feeding expenses for biological properties used cash of $18,090,592 and $10,741,615
for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we spent $15,623,459 and
$4,555,600, respectively, for purchasing milk cows. Conversely, we received cash of $2,090,254 and $1,875,642 during the years
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the collection of notes receivable from the disposal of biological properties
in 2011 and 2014. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we also received $955,494 and $19,524 in cash from our disposal
of biological properties, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we spent $28,009,904 and $3,784,064, respectively,
for the addition of PP E for daily operations. The material additions during the year ended June 30, 2016 were the production
facilities, office buildings, cow-houses, and forage storage built and refurbished on the new land, which mostly were completed
and in service before June 30, 2016. 

Financing
activities    

Our
financing activities mainly included proceeds from shareholders and repayment to shareholders for the year ended June 30,
2015. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we received $0 and $193,182 from shareholders, respectively. For the years
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we repaid $0 and $99,316 to our shareholders, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2016,
our 53.07% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited issued 84,906,541 CDI shares at AUD $0.2 per share on ASX and
raised a total net fund of $12,553,267.    

We
have historically financed our operations through cash generated from our fresh milk sales and commissions from milk sales from
local farmers. Over the long term, it is our expectation to utilize our additional capital resources to expand our operating activities. At
the present time, however, we are able to operate profitably without any significant additional investment. Moreover, our
observation of the equity markets indicates that we would be unlikely to obtain financing, or if available, on favorable terms
at this time. Accordingly, our near-term plan is to finance our operations with our current working capital and with the expected
income from our ongoing operations.   

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates    

Basis
of Accounting and Presentation    

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations
of the SEC.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company s primary sources of revenues are derived from (a) sale of fresh milk to Chinese manufacturing and distribution
companies of dairy products and (b) commissions from local farmers on their monthly milk sales.  The Company s
revenue recognition policies comply with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 104. Revenues from the sale of
milk are recognized when the milk is delivered and the title is transferred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred
to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.   

Milk
sales revenue is recognized when the title to the goods has been passed to our customers, which is the date when the goods are
delivered to designated locations and accepted by the customers and the previously discussed requirements are met.  Fresh
milk is delivered to our customers on a daily basis.  The customers  acceptance occurs upon inspection of quality
and measurement of quantity at the time of delivery. The Company does not provide the customer with the right of return.  Sales
commission revenue is recognized on a monthly basis based on monthly sales reports received from the dairy companies.  

Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To
the Board of Directors and  

  Stockholders
of China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc. and Subsidiaries  

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the
 Company ) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended June 30, 2016. China
Modern Agricultural Information, Inc. and Subsidiaries  management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in two year period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1.  
      ORGANIZATION    

China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc.
(the  Company ), formerly known as Trade Link Wholesalers, Inc. ( Trade Link ), was incorporated on December
22, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On April 4, 2011, the Board of Directors of Trade Link filed an amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Nevada to effect the name change from Trade Link to China Modern Agricultural Information,
Inc. 

On January 28, 2011, Trade Link entered into
a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) by and among (i) Value Development Holdings, Ltd. ( Value
Development ), a British Virgin Islands company, ( BVI ) (ii) Value Development s stockholders, (iii) Trade
Link, and (iv) Trade Link s principal stockholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Value Development and
the Value Development stockholders transferred to Trade Link all of the shares of Value Development in exchange for the issuance
of 35,998,000 shares of Trade Link s common stock as set forth in the Exchange Agreement, so that the Value Development stockholders
owned 87.80% of Trade Link s outstanding shares (the  Share Exchange ). 

On January 28, 2011, Value Development
through its wholly subsidiaries, Value Development Group Limited completed the acquisition of Harbin Jiasheng Consulting Managerial
Co. Ltd. ( Jiasheng Consulting  or  WFOE ), a holding company. Jiasheng Consulting has Variable Interest
Entity ( VIE ) agreements with Mr. Liu Zhengxin, the Company s Chief HR Officer, and Mr. Wang Youliang, the
Company s Chief Executive Officer, as well as with Heilongjiang Zhongxian Information Co., Ltd. ( Zhongxian Information ).
Mr. Zhengxin holds a 62% equity interest in Zhongxian Information and Mr. Youliang holds a 38% equity interest in Zhongxian Information.
Pursuant to the VIE agreement signed by Mr. Zhengxin and Mr. Youliang, Jiasheng Consulting now controls and performs all management
responsibilities for Zhongxian Information. The contractual arrangements are comprised of a series of agreements, including a
shareholder voting rights proxy agreement, exclusive consulting and service agreement, exclusive call option agreement and equity

      ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)    

In order to further reinforce Jiasheng Consulting s
rights to control and operate Zhongxian Information, the stockholders of Zhongxian Information have granted Jiasheng Consulting
the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in Zhongxian Information through an Exclusive Option Agreement. 

The exchange agreement transaction constituted
a reverse takeover transaction. Accordingly, reverse takeover accounting was adopted for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements. As a result, the consolidated financial statements are issued under the name of China Modern Agricultural Information,
Inc. (the legal acquirer), but are a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Value Development (the accounting
acquirer) and the VIE its subsidiaries. Before and after the Share Exchange, Value Development, Value Development Group Limited
(a wholly-owned subsidiary of Value Development), Jiasheng Consulting, and Zhongxian Information and their 99% owned subsidiary,
Heilongjiang Xinhua Cattle Industry Co., Ltd. ( Xinhua Cattle ) were under common control. Therefore, the reorganization
was effectively a legal recapitalization accounted for as transactions between entities under common control at the carry over
basis, in a manner similar to pooling-of-interests accounting. 

Zhongxian Information and Xinhua Cattle are
engaged in the acquisition, breeding and rearing of dairy cows, and production and sale of fresh milk to manufacturing and distribution
companies. Zhongxian Information was established in China in January 2005 with registered capital of 10 million Renminbi ( RMB ).
In February 2006, it acquired 99% of the registered capital of Xinhua Cattle, which was established in China in December 2005 with
registered capital of three million RMB. Xinhua Cattle had no significant activities and its cost approximated the fair value at
the date of acquisition. 

On November 23, 2011, Zhongxian Information
acquired 100% of the equity interest of Shangzhi Yulong Co., Ltd. ( Yulong ) from Yulong s original stockholders
for consideration of 9,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock and cash consideration of $4,396,000. 

Yulong was a privately held company
in China engaged in the acquisition, breeding and rearing of dairy cows, and production and sale of fresh milk to manufacturing
and distribution companies.

On July 16, 2015, the Company, transferred
100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Value Development Holdings, Ltd. ( Value Development ) to China Dairy
Corporation Ltd. ( China Dairy,  a Hong Kong company), which is 60% owned indirectly by the Company through the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary, Hope Diary Holdings Ltd. ( Hope Diary,  a British Virgin Islands company). China Dairy was
newly incorporated in January 2015 and did not have any significant assets or liabilities, or business operations, which was 100%
owned by Company s PRC corporate advisor, who formed China Dairy on behalf of the Company. Further, the sole shareholder
transferred 60% of the total outstanding shares of China Dairy to Hope Diary and 40% to various shareholders and consultants of
the Company (as described below) for nominal consideration. 

These transactions involve no consideration
received or paid as Value Development and China Dairy are under common control by the Company and this transaction is a restriction
to the Company s interests in Value Development.

The 40% of the 10,000 shares of China
Dairy were transferred from the sole shareholder of China Dairy to the following entities for nominal consideration, which has
direct or indirect relationship with the shareholder and consultants of the Company: 3% to Beijing Ruihua Future, 4% to Donghe
Group, 3% to Integral Capital, 20% to Dingxi Shanghai Fund and 10% to Zhiyuan International. Immediately after the transfer, 65,000
bonus shares were issued at no consideration for every existing share held by the following entities: 

Value Development is the sole owner
of Value Development Group Limited, which is the sole owner of Harbin Jiasheng Consulting Managerial Co. Ltd., which is the Company s
subsidiary in China, with respect to which the operating company, Heilongjiang Zhongxian Information Co. Ltd., is a variable interest
entity. The effect of this transaction was to reduce the interest of the Company in its operating company by 40%. The Company uses
the China Dairy s offering price for IPO to approximate the fair value of the 40% stock granted to the shareholder and consultants.
The Company recognized a stock compensation to the shareholder and consultants of approximately $32,098,000 and $5,664,000, respectively,
during the three months ended September 30, 2015 in general and administrative expense. 

On September 16, 2015 the
Company s 60%-owned subsidiary, Harbin Jiasheng Consulting Management Co., Ltd. ( Jiasheng Consulting ), exercised
its option to purchase all of the registered equity of the Company s operating subsidiary, Heilongjiang Zhongxian Information
Co., Ltd. ( Zhongxian Information ) from its stockholders Zhengxin Liu and Youliang Wang, who are also the members of
the Company s Board of Directors, for RMB10, 000 (approximately $1,554).

Prior to the acquisition,
Jiasheng Consulting controlled Zhongxian Information through a series of contractual agreements, which made Zhongxian Information
a variable interest entity, the effect of which was to cause the balance sheet and operating results of Zhongxian Information
to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting in the Company s financial statements. As a result of the acquisition
by Jiasheng Consulting of the registered ownership of Zhongxian Information, the balance sheet and operating results of Zhongxian
Information will hereafter continue to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting as its 100% owned subsidiary. On April
8, 2016, the Company s 60% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited issued 84,906,541 CDI shares at Australian Dollar
( AUD ) $0.2 per share on ASX and raised total fund of AUD $16,981,308 (USD $13,021,267). After the IPO, the Company s
ownership was diluted to 53.07%.

Variable Interest
Entity  

Pursuant to Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810,   Consolidation   ( ASC
810 ), the Company is required to include in its consolidated financial statements the financial statements of its
VIE s. ASC 810 requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of
loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE s residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which a
company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risk of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of
the entity, and therefore the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity. 

Zhongxian Information and its subsidiaries
(collectively, the  Chinese VIE ) have no assets that are collateral for or restricted solely to settle their obligations.
The creditors of the Chinese VIE and its subsidiaries do not have recourse to the Company s general credit. Because Value
Development, Value Development Group Limited and Jiasheng Consulting are established for the sole purpose of holding ownership
interest and do not have any operations, the financial statement amounts and balances are principally those of the Chinese VIE
and its subsidiaries. 

Under ASC 810, an enterprise has a controlling
financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the enterprise has both of the following characteristics: (a) the
power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance; and (b) the obligation
to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company s determination
of whether it has this power is not affected by the existence of kick-out rights or participating rights, unless a single enterprise,
including its related parties and de facto agents, has the unilateral ability to exercise those rights. The Chinese VIE s
actual stockholders do not hold any kick-out rights that will affect the consolidation determination. 

On September 16, 2015 the VIE structure
was terminated when Jiasheng Consulting exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of Zhongxian Information.
Jiasheng Consulting became the sole owner of Zhongxian Information.

Foreign Currency Translations  

All Company assets are located
in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ). The functional currency for the majority of the Company s
operations is the Renminbi ( RMB ). The Company uses the United States dollar ( US Dollar  or
 US$  or  $ ) for financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial statements of the Company
have been translated into US dollars in accordance with FASB ASC 830,   Foreign Currency Matters.   All
asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Equity
accounts have been translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. Statements of income
and other comprehensive income amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented.
Adjustments resulting from the translation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are recorded as other
comprehensive income ( OCI ). 

The exchange rates used to translate
amounts in RMB and Australian dollars (the  A$ ) into US dollars for preparing the consolidated financial statements
are as follows:

       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

Foreign
Currency Translations (continued)   

Foreign
currency translation adjustments of $(11,711,703) and $560,995, respectively, for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, have
been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income (loss).
Other comprehensive income (loss) of the Company consists entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments. Pursuant to ASC
740-30-25-17,   Exceptions to Comprehensive Recognition of Deferred Income Taxes,   the Company does not recognize
deferred U.S. taxes related to the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, recognizes no income tax
expense or benefit from foreign currency translation adjustments.  

Although
government regulations now allow convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain.
Hence, such translations should not be construed as representations that the RMB could be converted into US dollars at that rate
or any other rate.  

The
value of the RMB against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China s
political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB could materially affect the Company s consolidated
financial condition in terms of US dollar reporting.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company s primary sources of revenues are derived from (a) sale of fresh milk to Chinese manufacturing and distribution
companies of dairy products and (b) commissions from local farmers on their monthly milk sales. The Company s revenue recognition
policies comply with FASB ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition.   Revenues from the sale of goods are recognized when
the goods are delivered and the title is transferred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer,
the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.

Revenue
Recognition (continued)   

Milk
sales revenue is recognized when the title has been passed to the customers, which is the date when the milk is delivered to designated
locations and accepted by the customers and the previously discussed requirements are met. Fresh milk is delivered to its customers
on a daily basis. The customers  acceptance occurs upon inspection of the quality and measurement of quantity at the time
of delivery. The Company does not provide the customer with the right of return. Sales commission revenue is recognized on a monthly
basis based on monthly sales reports received.   

Vulnerability
Due to Operations in PRC    

The
Company s operations may be adversely affected by significant political, economic and social uncertainties in the PRC. Although
the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than twenty years, no assurance can be given that the PRC
government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event
of a change in leadership, social or political disruption or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC s political, economic
and social conditions. There is also no guarantee that the PRC government s pursuit of economic reforms will be consistent
or effective.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

FASB
ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement   specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs
to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based on market data obtained from independent
sources (observable inputs). In accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy:  

Level 1 Inputs
        
      Unadjusted
    quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.   

Level
    2 Inputs     
      Inputs
    other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.   

Level
    3 Inputs     
      Inputs
    based on valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements.   

ASC
820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure
fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Valuation techniques used need to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  

The
Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented at fair value on a recurring basis. Carrying
values of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, interest receivable, accrued expenses, and
other payables, and stockholder loans, approximated their fair values due to the short maturity of these financial instruments.
The carrying value of notes receivable is valued at their net realizable value which approximates the fair value. There were no
changes in methods or assumptions during the periods presented.

Advertising
Costs   

Advertising
costs are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising costs are $62,929 and $814, respectively, for the years ended June
30, 2016 and 2015.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all demand and time deposits and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.   

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable is stated at cost, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts if required. Receivables outstanding longer than the
payment terms are considered past due. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses when necessary
resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis
and makes allowances where there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances.   

In
evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the
balance, the customer s payment history, its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. The Company has 30 days
credit term for its milk sales and usually receives the payment in the following month. The Company considers all accounts receivable
at June 30, 2016 and 2015, to be fully collectible and, therefore, did not provide an allowance for doubtful accounts. For the
periods presented, the Company did not write off any accounts receivable as bad debts.  

Inventories   

Inventories,
comprised principally of livestock feed, are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The value of inventories is determined
using the weighted average cost method.  

The
Company estimates an inventory allowance for excessive or unusable inventories. Inventory amounts are reported net of such allowances
if any. There was no allowance for excessive or unusable inventories as of June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Prepaid
Expenses   

Prepaid expenses as of June

expenses and for heating expenses. 

Prepaid
Land Leases   

Prepaid
land leases represent the prepayment for grassland rental (see Note 7).  

Property,
Plant and Equipment   

Property, plant and equipment
are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the price paid to acquire or construct the asset, including
capitalized interest during the construction period, and any expenditure that substantially increase the assets value or extends
the useful life of an existing asset. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend original useful lives or improve productivity are capitalized
and depreciated over the periods benefited. Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred. 

The
estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:  

Machinery
    and equipment  
      3

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets   

The
Company utilizes FASB ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment   ( ASC 360 ), which addresses the
financial accounting and reporting for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets. In accordance
with ASC 360, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company may recognize an impairment of a long-lived asset in the event the net
book value of such asset exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset. No impairment of long-lived
assets was recognized for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Biological
Assets   

Biological
assets consist of dairy cows for milking purposes and breeding.   

Immature
Biological Assets    

Immature
biological assets are recorded at cost, including acquisition costs, transportation costs, insurance expenses, and feeding costs,
incurred in raising the cows. Once the cow is able to produce milk, the cost of the immature biological asset is transferred to
mature biological assets using the weighted average cost method.  

Mature
Biological Assets    

Mature
biological assets are recorded at their original purchase price or the weighted average immature biological asset transfer cost.
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of eight years using the straight-line method. The estimated residual
value is 10%. Feeding and management costs incurred on mature biological assets are included as cost of goods sold. When biological
assets, including male cows, are retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, the cost and accumulated depreciation
will be removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss will be included in the results of operations for the respective
period. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, a loss of $373,108 and $1,104,345, respectively, on the sale of the adult
cows is included in non-operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.

      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

Biological
Assets (continued)   

The
Company reviews the carrying value of its biological assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events and circumstances
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual
disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss will
be recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors considered by management
in performing this assessment include current health status and production capacity. There were no impairment losses recorded
during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740 ),
which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial
statement and income tax purposes. The differences relate principally to the undistributed earnings of the Company s subsidiary
under PRC law. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which will either
be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating
losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, undistributed earnings allocated to Zhongxian Information
were approximately $192,800,000 and $160,600,000, respectively.

Income
Taxes (Continued)   

ASC
740 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in
the financial statements. Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is
more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on
the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance
on de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities,
and accounting for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company does
not have a liability for any uncertain tax positions.  

The
income tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate are summarized as follows:  

United
States    

The
Company is subject to United States tax at graduated rates from 15% to 35%. No provision for income tax in the United States has
been made as the Company had no U.S. taxable income for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.   

BVI    

Value

       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

Income
Taxes (Continued)   

PRC    

Xinhua
Cattle and Yulong are entitled to a tax exemption for the full Enterprise Income Tax in China due to a government tax preferential
policy for the dairy farming industry. In January 2015, Zhongxian Information obtained an income tax exemption notice from the
tax authority to exempt the income tax on its investment income from its subsidiaries Xinhua Cattle and Yulong.  

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share   

The
Company computes net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,   Earnings Per Share   ( ASC
260 ). Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the amount available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income
per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding plus the effect of any dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Accordingly, the number of weighted
average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net income per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations
for all periods reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. There were no
dilutive shares outstanding during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Statutory
Reserve Fund   

Pursuant
to the corporate law of the PRC, Jiasheng Consulting and the Company s Chinese VIE and its subsidiaries are required to
transfer 10% of their net income, as determined under PRC accounting rules and regulations, to a statutory reserve fund until
such reserve balance reaches 50% of its registered capital. The statutory reserve fund is non-distributable other than during
liquidation and can be used to fund previous years  losses, if any, and may be utilized for business expansion or used
to increase registered capital, provided that the remaining reserve balance after such use is not less than 25% of the
registered capital. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the required statutory reserve funds have been fully funded.

       Recently Issued Accounting
Standards     

In
April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).'' This guidance supersedes current
guidance on revenue recognition in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.'' In addition, there are disclosure requirements related
to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-14 to
defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. For public business entities that follow U.S. GAAP,
the deferral results in the new revenue standard are being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that
requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the
income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing
at or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain
practical expedients available. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements. 

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which
includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard
is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

                                         Issued Accounting Standards     (CONTINUED)     

In
September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-16: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period
Adjustments ( ASU 2015-16 ), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement
period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact
on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. ASU 2015-16 is effective for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment is effective for all
entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier application
is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within
that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In
May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-09,  Financial Services-Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts. 
This guidance requires insurance entities to disclose for annual reporting periods incurred and paid claims development information
by accident year, after reinsurance, for the number of years for which claims typically remain open. Disclosures should also include
quantitative information about claim frequency and a qualitative description of methodologies used for determining claim frequency
information. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15,
2015, and is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2016. Early and retrospective application is permitted.
This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).  This
guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair value is measured using
the net asset value per share practical expedient and removes certain related disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective
for annual reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and is applicable to the Company's
fiscal year beginning June 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.   

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40):
Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.  This guidance clarifies the accounting treatment
for fees paid in cloud computing arrangements, including the determination of whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a
software license. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December
15, 2015, and is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. This accounting
standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs.  This Guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction
of the related debt liability rather than an asset. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim
periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2016. Early adoption
is permitted for financial statements not previously issued. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

until such earnings are actually distributed to Jiasheng Consulting. A deferred tax liability was provided for the tax to be paid
when these earnings are distributed. On September 16, 2015 due to the termination of VIE structure (Note 1), Jiasheng Consulting
would not be taxable in the future undistributed earnings from Xinhua Cattle and Yulong under the Enterprise Income Tax Law that
Chinese resident enterprise is an exemption of dividend income received from another Chinese resident enterprise. 

Deferred
tax assets (liabilities) are comprised of the following:     

At
June 30, 2016 and 2015, Zhongxian Information had unused operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,990,000 and $1,836,000,
respectively, expiring in various years through 2020. The Company has established a valuation allowance of approximately $498,000
and $460,000 against the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carry forward at June 30, 2016 and 2015, due to
the uncertainty of realizing the benefit.
