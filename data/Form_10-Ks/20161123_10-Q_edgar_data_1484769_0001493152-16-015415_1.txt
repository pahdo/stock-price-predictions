Note
1 - Organization and Basis of Operations   

Carolco
Pictures, Inc. (formerly  Brick Top Productions, Inc  or the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Florida in February 2009 under the name  York Entertainment, Inc.  The Company changed its name to
Brick Top Productions, Inc. in October 2010. In January 2015, the Company changed its name from Brick Top Productions, Inc. to
Carolco Pictures, Inc. In addition, in January 2015, the Company changed its stock symbol from  BTOP  to  CRCO.   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) as promulgated in the United States of America ( U.S. ) and with instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant
to the rules and regulations of Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and Article 8-03
of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of
the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, we have included
all adjustments considered necessary (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) for a fair presentation. Operating results for
the three months ended March 31, 2016 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December
31, 2016. You should read these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
filed on November 22, 2016. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited
financial statements included in the Form 10-K for that year.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, and which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $7,787,000 at March 31,
2016, and incurred a net loss of $2,499,000, and utilized net cash used in operating activities $144,000 for the three months
ended. In addition, at March 31, 2016, $543,000 of convertible notes payable   related party and $57,000 of convertible
note matured and were in default. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. In addition, our independent auditors, in their report on our audited financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2015 expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to execute its strategy and
in its ability to raise additional funds. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of
equity securities for cash to operate its business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional
financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for
our stock holders, in case or equity financing. In July 2016, the Company raised approximately $416,000 through the issuance of
487,000 shares of common stock. Management estimates that the current funds on hand as of the date of this report, amounting to
approximately $120,000 will be sufficient to continue operations through the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include depreciable lives of property and equipment,
analysis of impairments of recorded goodwill, accruals for potential liabilities, assumptions made in valuing derivative liabilities
and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
Company s consolidated subsidiaries and/or entities are as follows:  

The
accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries.
The consolidated accounts include 100% of the assets and liabilities of our majority owned subsidiaries, and the ownership interests
of minority investors are recorded as a minority interest.   All
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described:  

Level
    1  
         
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2  
         
      Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.   

Level
    3  
         
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, other assets, accounts payable and accrued
payroll, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of notes payable
and convertible notes approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on
prevailing market interest rates.  

The
carrying amount of the Company s derivative liability of $6,879,000 and $4,673,000 as of March 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015 was based on Level 2 measurements.  

Concentrations    

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company had one customer that accounted for 80% of sales respectively. During the three
months ended March 31, 2015, the Company had one customer that accounted for 95% of sales.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company specializes in the development and presentation of television programming including series, specials, pilots, live events
and award shows. The Company recognizes revenue from its live events and award show productions when all of the following criteria
are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the show or live event has been completed and occurred and there
are no future production obligations, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Revenues
from the sale of programming for television and other media will be recognized when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the show/episode is complete, and in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, has
been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery; (iii) the price to the customer is fixed and determinable;
and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as
compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants
issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at
the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options and warrants granted to non-employees
are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options
and warrants vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already
recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements
by the non-employee, option and warrant grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded
in the period of the measurement date.  

The
fair value of the Company s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options
or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.  

Deposit
for Film Project to Related Party    

Deposit
for film project include capitalizable production costs, production overhead, interest, development costs and acquired production
costs and are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value. The amount by which the unamortized costs
of film and television productions exceed their estimated fair values is written off. Film development costs for projects that
have been abandoned or have not been set for production within three years are generally written off.  

Loss
Per Share    

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock method that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the Company. In computing diluted loss per share, the treasury stock
method assumes that outstanding options and warrants are exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average
market price during the period. Options and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the
average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants.  

At
March 31, 2016 and 2015 we had 2,952,600 warrants outstanding, which were excluded from the loss per share calculation as they
were anti-dilutive.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments    

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the statements of operations. The Company uses a probability weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton models to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates through the March 31, 2016, reporting date.  

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is
evaluated at the end of each reporting period.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in
the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from
costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right
of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02
is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified
retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after,
the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) : Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. The amendments in this ASU require, among other things, that all income tax effects of awards be recognized
in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee s
shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election
to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual
period. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related
disclosures.  

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.

Note
5- Convertible Notes Payable in Default   

Convertible
notes payable consist of the following as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

(a)    On
                                         May 6, 2015, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note in the principal
                                         amount of $91,000 to St. George Investments, LLC (the  Lender ). The note
                                         bore interest at 22% per annum, as amended and matured in April 2016. Under the terms
                                         of the note, there was an original issue discount ( OID ) of $8,000 withheld
                                         at funding and the Company agreed to pay $3,000 to the Lender to cover the Lender s
                                         legal fees and other transaction related costs. The Company recognized the OID as a note
                                         discount and the $3,000 fee as debt issuance costs. Both the note discount and issuance
                                         costs recognized in the transaction were accreted to interest expense over the life of
                                         the note. In addition, the Company paid an $8,000 finders  fee in the transaction
                                         which has been recorded in debt issuance costs and is being accreted to interest expense
                                         of the life of the note. The note was convertible by the Lender into common stock of
                                         the Company at the lesser of $0.45 per share or, in the event the Company s market
                                         capitalization falls below $15.0 million, at a defined Lender conversion price. As of
                                         December 31, 2015, outstanding balance of the note amounted to $56,000 and accrued interest
                                         of $4,000.    

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company accrued interest of $3,000 and paid off the note in its entirety with a total
of interest and principal balance of $62,000.

                                         of $104,000 to the Vis Vires Group, Inc. ( VVG ). The note bore interest
                                         at 22% per annum, as amended, and matured in February 2016. VVG deducted $2,000 from
                                         the proceeds to cover their legal and other transaction related costs which was recorded
                                         as debt issuance costs and is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the
                                         note. The note carried a variable conversion price defined as 61% of the market price
                                         (representing a 39% discount), with market price being defined as the average of the
                                         lowest three trading days for the Company s common stock during the 10 day period
                                         prior to the conversion date. As of December 31, 2015, outstanding balance of the note

                                         to the Auctus Fund, LLC ( Auctus ). The note bears interest at 24% per annum,
                                         as amended, and matured in March 2016. Auctus deducted $8,000 from the proceeds to cover
                                         their legal and other transaction related costs which were recorded as debt issuance
                                         costs and is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. In addition,
                                         the Company paid an $8,000 finders  fee in this transaction which has been recorded
                                         in debt issuance costs and was accreted to interest expense over the life of the note.
                                         The note carried a variable conversion price defined as 50% of the market price (representing
                                         a 50% discount), with market price being defined as the lowest trading price of our common
                                         stock during the 25-trading day period prior to the conversion date. As of December 31,
                                         2015, outstanding balance of the note amounted to $86,000 and accrued interest of $7,000.

(d)    On
                                         July 10, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount
                                         of $52,500 to the Vis Vires Group, Inc. ( VVG ). The note bore interest at
                                         22% per annum, as amended and matured in April 2016. VVG deducted $1,000 from the proceeds
                                         to cover their legal related costs which were charged to interest expense. The note carried
                                         a variable conversion price defined as 61% of the market price (representing a 39% discount),
                                         with market price being defined as the average of the lowest three trading days for the
                                         Company s common stock during the 10-day period prior to the conversion date. As
                                         of December 31, 2015, outstanding balance of the note amounted to $41,000 and accrued
                                         interest of $3,000.    

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company converted the entire principal and accrued interest amounting to $43,000 to
41,809,474 shares of common stock.  

The
Company considered the current FASB guidance of  Contracts in Entity s Own Stock  which indicates that any adjustment
to the fixed amount (either conversion price or number of shares) of the instrument regardless of the probability of whether or
not within the issuers  control means the instrument is not indexed to the issuer s own stock. Accordingly, the Company
determined that the conversion prices of these Notes were not a fixed amount because they were subject to an adjustment based
on the occurrence of future offerings or events. As a result, the Company determined that the conversion features of the Notes
were not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and characterized the fair value of the conversion features as derivative
liabilities upon issuance. The Company determined that upon issuance of the Notes in 2015, the initial fair value of the embedded
conversion feature was $532,000. As such, the Company recorded a $532,000 derivative liability, of which $305,000 was recorded
as debt discount offsetting the fair value of the Notes and the remainder of $226,000 was recorded as a financing cost in 2015.
The discount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt instruments. The unamortized
balance of the debt discount was $79,000 as of December 31, 2015.  

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company amortized to interest expense, $79,000 of the remaining debt discount recorded
when these notes were issued in fiscal 2015. In addition, the Company also recorded and paid additional interest of $55,000 due
to the default of certain of these notes.  

Note
6   Convertible Notes Payable to Related Party   

In
July 2015, the Company issued its convertible promissory notes to Alex Bafer, Chairman and former CEO in exchange for the cancellation
of previously issued promissory notes in the aggregate of $555,000 and accrued interest of $13,000 for a total of $543,000. The
notes are unsecured, bear interest of 5% per annum, matured on October 1, 2015 and are convertible to shares of common stock at
a conversion price equal to the lowest 20-day stock price prior to conversion with a 50% discount.  

The
Company considered the current FASB guidance of  Contracts in Entity s Own Stock  which indicates that any adjustment
to the fixed amount (either conversion price or number of shares) of the instrument regardless of the probability of whether or
not within the issuers  control means the instrument is not indexed to the issuer s own stock. Accordingly, the Company
determined that the conversion prices of the Notes were not a fixed amount because they were subject to an adjustment based on
the occurrence of future offerings or events. As a result, the Company determined that the conversion features of the Notes were
not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and characterized the fair value of the conversion features as derivative
liabilities upon issuance. The Company determined that upon issuance of the convertible Notes in 2015, the initial fair value
of the embedded conversion feature was $1.5 million. The Company determined that the cancellation of the previously issued promissory
notes in exchange for the convertible notes issued in 2015 was an extinguishment of debt, and the fair value of the derivative
liability of $1.5 million was created upon the exchange of debt instruments and was accounted as a debt extinguishment cost during
the year ended December 31, 2015.  

In
October 2015, the notes matured and became past due. As a result, the stated interest of 5% increased to 22% pursuant to the term
of the note. As of December 31, 2015, total outstanding note balance amounted to $543,000 and accrued interest of $42,000.  

During
the period ended March 31, 2016, the Company accrued interest of $30,000. As of March 31, 2016, total outstanding note balance
amounted to $543,000 and accrued interest of $72,000.  

In
July 2016, the Company and Mr. Bafer agreed to extend the maturity date of these notes to August 1, 2017. There were no other
terms changed and no additional compensation paid.  

Note
7 - Derivative Liability   

The
FASB has issued authoritative guidance whereby instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative
instruments. Certain warrants issued to investors and conversion features of notes payable do not have fixed settlement provisions
because their exercise prices will be lowered if the Company issues securities at lower prices in the future. In accordance with
the FASB authoritative guidance, the conversion feature of the notes was separated from the host contract (i.e., the notes) and
the fair value of the warrants have been recognized as a derivative and will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period
with the change in value reported in the statement of operations.  

The
Company had one convertible note payable to a related party and warrants to purchase a total of 900,000 shares of common stock
as of March 31, 2016 that were accounted for as derivative liability. The derivative liability was valued at the following dates
using a probability based weighted-average Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following average assumptions:  

The
risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Company uses the historical volatility
of its common stock to estimate the future volatility for its common stock. The expected life of the was determined by the remaining
contractual life of the derivative instrument. For derivative instrument that already matured, the Company used the estimated
life. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends to its common stockholders in
the past and does not expect to pay dividends to its common stockholders in the future.  

During
the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $174,000 upon the extinguishment of derivative liabilities
related to the payment and conversion of the corresponding convertible notes, and $2,380,000 relating to the change in the fair
value of the derivatives during the period. As of March 31, 2016, the aggregate fair value of the derivative liabilities was $6,879,000.  

Note
8 - Stockholders  Deficit   

In
January 2016, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 5,000,000,000 and the
number of shares of its preferred stock from 10,000,000 to 50,000,000, the rights and preferences of which to be determined by

The
Company may be involved in certain legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Except
for income tax contingencies (commencing April 1, 2009), the Company records accruals for contingencies to the extent that management

with the contingency are expensed as incurred.  

Studiocanal
S.A.

S.A., which claims to be the assignee of trademark rights in certain marks previously registered by a company that has been defunct
since 1996. The letter stated that use of the marks by the Company is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive
as to whether there is an affiliation or association between the Company and the defunct entity and/or Studiocanal, and requested
that the Company cease and desist from use of such marks and relinquish trademark registrations legally obtained by the Company
and after judicial decision. The Company responded and discussions were held between representatives of the Company and Studiocanal.
At this time, Company is not aware of any legal claim having been brought by Studiocanal.

Convertible Promissory Notes ( Notes ). Pursuant to the terms of the Notes Amendment, Mr. Bafer waived any default
under each of the Notes through the date of the Notes Amendment as a result of any amounts payable under the Notes not being paid
as of October 1, 2015 and waived the payment of any Default Interest (as defined in the Notes) through the date of the Notes Amendment
as a result of such failure of payment. No other terms of the loans changed, and we did not pay any consideration for the extension.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Unless
otherwise indicated, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to  we,   us,  and  our 
are to the Company, unless the context requires otherwise. The following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed interim financial statements and
the accompanying related notes included in this quarterly report and our audited financial statements and related notes and Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   

Overview   

We
were incorporated on February 20, 2009, in the State of Florida, under the name York Entertainment, Inc. On October 5, 2010, we
amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Brick Top Productions, Inc. Effective December 31, 2014, we amended
our articles of incorporation to change our name to Carolco Pictures, Inc.  

We
are an award-winning feature film and television specials production company. We seek to finance, produce and distribute one or
more television series and feature films to be licensed for exploitation in domestic and international theatrical, television,
cable, home video and pay per view markets.  

Through
our subsidiary, High Five Entertainment, we specialize in the development and presentation of quality television programming including
live events and award shows.  

Through
our subsidiary, Recall Studios that we acquired in July 2016, we focus on Virtual Reality content, filling the demand attendant
to the increased production of virtual reality viewing devices absent a corresponding increase in content production. Founded
by business, media and entertainment industry leaders to meet growing demand for virtual reality and augmented reality content,
Recall Studios operates within the convergence of immersive content and software. Recall Studios will allow consumers to create
and share interactive experiences across all platforms. Combining modern business strategy with industry experience by bringing
together highly trained relative newcomers and entertainment industry stalwarts to create low risk, high profit and artistically
acclaimed feature film virtual reality and television projects, the Company and its subsidiaries are analyzing profitability across
myriad entertainment sectors.  

Management s
Plan   

The
business side of our management team is disciplined in financial risk mitigation techniques. Aside from the commercialization
of our management team s past successes, which cannot in themselves necessarily predict future success, we are experienced
at balancing projects, budgets and growth to effectively manage risk in light of our business objectives.  

We
believe that we have unique access to Hollywood talent, scripts and third parties ripe for acquisition. We believe that the reputation
of our management team in producing some of the most-well known, talked about and socially ingrained entertainment opens doors
for us that are closed to others.  

We
believe we represent a new model in entertainment industry profitability. We intend to focus on growth and efficiency. Our development
plan combines modern business strategy with old-fashioned industry experience. Our early acquisition, High Five Entertainment,
has given us highly regarded, industry leading talent. We have matched that talent with new and existing property development.
By targeting additional revenue positive entertainment projects and companies, we expect to achieve increased profitability and
efficiency through scale.  

We
believe that our management team s reputation, contacts and experience give us a competitive edge. However, the market for
productions currently is, and is expected to continue to be, extremely competitive. Our competitors include many companies that
have substantially greater financial, management, marketing resources and experience than us. There can be no assurance that our
productions will be competitive with other motion pictures or television shows, or that we will be able to achieve or maintain
profitability.

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues
for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were 22,000 and $2,000, respectively. The increase of $20,000 is derived from
production services, including award programming, much of which is seasonal.  

Cost
of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 decreased by $30,000. The decrease
was attributable primarily due to lower production labor as the Company was not heavily involved in production projects during
the three months ended March 31, 2016.  

Operating
expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 totaled $142,000, compared to $726,000 for the three months ended March 31,
2015. The decrease of approximately $584,000 was primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation expenses recognized between
the periods. Compensation expense recognized in the prior period reflected significant costs associated with stock based compensation
expense recognized attributable to the Company s acquisition of S G Holdings, Inc.  

The
Company realized a loss before income tax provision and non-controlling interest of $2,499,000 for the three months ended March
31, 2016, compared to a loss before income tax provision and non-controlling interest of $730,000 for the three months ended March
31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the change in fair value of derivatives associated with warrants and convertible notes
outstanding, which amounted to $2,380,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of March 31, 2016, our assets totaled $273,000 and our liabilities totaled $8,060,000 and we had negative working capital of $8,038,000.  

Pursuant
to the terms of our employment agreement with Mr. Bafer, we are obligated to pay Mr. Bafer $150,000 per year. On October 1, 2011,
Mr. Bafer agreed to waive future base salary under his employment agreement, until further notice, in an effort to reduce our
operating expenses. Prior to that time, we did not have sufficient cash flows to make the required payments under the employment
agreement and therefore, accrued all unpaid salary until such time we generate revenues from operations or raise additional capital
through one or more financing transactions. Accrued salaries due totaled $170,000 and $125,000 at March 31, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.  

As
part of the Company s acquisition of S G Holdings, Inc. (doing business as High Five Entertainment) ( S G )
in December 2013, the Company entered into an executive employment agreement with Mr. Martin Fischer, pursuant to which Mr. Fischer
will serve as S G s president for an initial term of five years with an initial base salary of $144,000. He will also
be entitled to an annual bonus of up to $100,000 based on performance and a monthly car allowance of $500. In addition, the Company
awarded Mr. Fischer an option to purchase 1,491,351 shares of common stock, exercisable at $0.01 per share, which vested throughout
2014.  

We
have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our attaining and maintaining
profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard, we have raised additional capital through equity
offerings and loan transactions, and, in the short term, will seek to raise additional capital in such manners to fund our operations.
We do not currently have any additional third party financing available in the form of loans, advances, or commitments. Our officers
and shareholders have not made any written or oral agreement to provide us additional financing. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to continue to raise capital on terms and conditions that are deemed acceptable to us.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of March 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, and which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $7,787,000 at March 31,
2016, and incurred a net loss of $2,499,000, and utilized net cash used in operating activities $144,000 for the three months
ended March 31, 2016. In addition, at March 31, 2016, $543,000 of convertible notes payable to related parties and $57,000 of
convertible note matured and were in default. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to execute its strategy and
in its ability to raise additional funds. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of
equity securities for cash to operate its business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional
financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for
our stock holders, in case or equity financing. In July 2016, the Company raised approximately $416,000 through the issuance of
487,000 shares of common stock. Management estimates that the current funds on hand as of the date of this report, amounting to
approximately $120,000, will be sufficient to continue operations through the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
have identified the following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted
by the application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments.
These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact
quarterly or annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly
as expected, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies
are described in the following paragraphs.  

Non-Controlling
Interest.  The Company reports the non-controlling interest in its majority owned subsidiaries in the consolidated balance
sheets within the equity section, separately from the Company s stockholders  equity. Non-controlling interest represents
the non-controlling interest holders  proportionate share of the equity of the Company s majority-owned subsidiaries.
Non-controlling interest is adjusted for the non-controlling interest holders  proportionate share of the earnings or losses
and other comprehensive income (loss) and the non-controlling interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if
that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments  The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or
contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities,
the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in
the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a
probability weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton models to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation
dates through the December 31, 2015, reporting date. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.  

Stock-Based
Compensation  The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising
transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting
to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant
and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option
and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value
of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment
is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options and warrants
granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective
period. As the options and warrants vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference
between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are
no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option and warrant grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based
compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. The fair value of the Company s stock option and
warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free
interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense
is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

See
Note 2 in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting policies.  

Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012  

The
JOBS Act permits an  emerging growth company  such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply
with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected
to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an  emerging growth company. 
This election will permit us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that will have different effective dates
for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Consequently, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.

4. Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our CEO and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer,
an evaluation was performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and Principal
Financial and Accounting Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the
period covered by this report due to the Company s limited resources and limited number of employees. To mitigate the current
limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of
legal and outsourced accounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which, we believe, will
enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31,
2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

The
Company may be involved in certain legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Except
for income tax contingencies (commencing April 1, 2009), the Company records accruals for contingencies to the extent that management
concludes that the occurrence is probable and that the related amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated
with the contingency are expensed as incurred.  

Studiocanal
S.A.    

The
Company is not currently engaged in any legal proceedings, however, the Company received a letter dated April 26, 2016 from Studiocanal
S.A., which claims to be the assignee of trademark rights in certain marks previously registered by a company that has been defunct
since 1996. The letter stated that use of the marks by the Company is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive
as to whether there is an affiliation or association between the Company and the defunct entity and/or Studiocanal, and requested
that the Company cease and desist from use of such marks and relinquish trademark registrations legally obtained by the Company
and after judicial decision. The Company responded and discussions were held between representatives of the Company and Studiocanal.
At this time, Company is not aware of any legal claim having been brought by Studiocanal.
