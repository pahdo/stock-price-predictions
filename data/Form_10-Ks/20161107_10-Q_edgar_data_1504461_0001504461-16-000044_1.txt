Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Quarterly Report ) contains various forward-looking statements and information that are based on our beliefs and those of our general partner, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Certain words in this Quarterly Report such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   goal,   intend,   may,   plan,   project,   will,  and similar expressions and statements regarding our plans and objectives for future operations, identify forward-looking statements. Although we and our general partner believe such forward-looking statements are reasonable, neither we nor our general partner can assure they will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected. Among the key risk factors that may affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations are:

    the ability to obtain adequate supplies of products if an interruption in supply or transportation occurs and the availability of capacity to transport products to market areas; 
                
    actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations; 
                
    the political and economic stability of foreign oil and gas producing nations; 
                
    the effect of weather conditions on supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas liquids, refined products, ethanol, and biodiesel; 
                
    the effect of natural disasters, lightning strikes, or other significant weather events;

    hazards or operating risks related to transporting and distributing petroleum products that may not be fully covered by insurance; 
                
    the maturity of the crude oil, natural gas liquids, and refined products industries and competition from other marketers; 
                
    loss of key personnel;

    the costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings; 
                
    any reduction or the elimination of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard; and 
                
    changes in the jurisdictional characteristics of, or the applicable regulatory policies with respect to, our pipeline assets. 
       
  You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.

Note 1   Organization and Operations 
    
  NGL Energy Partners LP ( we,   us,   our,  or the  Partnership ) is   a Delaware limited partnership  .   NGL Energy Holdings LLC serves as our general partner.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   our operations include: 

Our Crude Oil Logistics segment, the assets of which include owned and leased crude oil storage terminals and pipeline injection stations, a fleet of owned trucks and trailers, a fleet of owned and leased railcars, a fleet of owned barges and towboats, and interests in     two     crude oil pipelines,     purchases crude oil from producers and transports it to refineries or for resale at owned and leased pipeline injection stations, storage terminals, barge loading facilities, rail facilities, refineries, and other trade hubs. 
                
    Our Water Solutions segment, the assets of which include water pipelines, water treatment and disposal facilities, washout facilities, and solid waste disposal facilities,     provides services for the treatment and disposal of wastewater generated from crude oil and natural gas production and for the disposal of solids such as tank bottoms and drilling fluids and performs truck washouts. In addition, our Water Solutions segment sells the recovered hydrocarbons that result from performing these services. 
                
    Our Liquids segment supplies natural gas liquids to retailers, wholesalers, refiners, and petrochemical plants throughout the United States and in Canada using its leased underground storage and fleet of leased railcars, markets regionally through its     18     owned terminals throughout the United States, and provides terminaling and storage services at its salt dome storage facility in Utah. 
                
    Our Retail Propane segment sells propane, distillates, and equipment and supplies to end users consisting of residential, agricultural, commercial, and industrial customers and to certain resellers in     27     states and the District of Columbia. 
                
    Our Refined Products and Renewables segment, which conducts gasoline, diesel, ethanol, and biodiesel marketing operations, purchases refined petroleum and renewable products primarily in the Gulf Coast, Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States and schedules them for delivery at various locations. 
       
  Recent Developments 
    
  On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our general partner interest in TransMontaigne Partners L.P. ( TLP ) to an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners ( ArcLight ). As a result, on February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP and began to account for our limited partner investment in TLP using the equity method of accounting. See   Note 2   for a discussion of the sale. As TLP was previously a consolidated entity, our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2015   included three months and six months, respectively, of TLP s operations and income attributable to the noncontrolling interests of TLP.   On April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned to     ArcLight  . See   Note 2   for a discussion of the sale. 

Note 2   Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.   Investments we cannot control, but can exercise significant influence over, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.   We also own an undivided interest in a crude oil pipeline. We have included our proportionate share of assets, liabilities, and expenses related to this pipeline in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim consolidated financial information in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements exclude certain information and notes required by GAAP for complete annual consolidated financial statements. However, we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. Such adjustments consist only

    NGL ENERGY PARTNERS LP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 
  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, and for the 
  Three Months and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

of normal recurring items, unless otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report. The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at   March 31, 2016   was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report ). 
    
  As previously reported, subsequent to the issuance of certain previously issued financial statements, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we determined that there were errors in those financial statements from not recording certain contingent consideration liabilities related to royalty agreements assumed as part of acquisitions in our Water Solutions segment.     The effect of the error was material to the financial statements for each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, so those quarters have been restated for the effects of the error correction.     We have restated our previously issued condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three months and     six months ended     September 30, 2015   and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   six months ended     September 30, 2015  .   See Note 17     in our Annual Report     for a summary of the impact of the error correction for the three months and     six months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report. Due to the seasonal nature of certain of our operations and other factors, the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for future periods or for the full fiscal year ending   March 31, 2017  . 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets and liabilities reported at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses reported during the periods presented. 
    
  Critical estimates we make in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements include determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the recoverability of inventories, useful lives and recoverability of property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, the impairment of assets, the fair value of asset retirement obligations, the value of equity-based compensation, and accruals for various commitments and contingencies, among others. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Our significant accounting policies are consistent with those disclosed in Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based upon assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. We use the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes valuation technique inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and (iv) inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means. Instruments categorized in Level 2 include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swap and option contracts. We determine the fair value of all of our derivative financial instruments utilizing pricing models for similar instruments. Inputs to the pricing models include publicly available prices and forward curves generated from a compilation of data gathered from third parties.

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 
  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, and for the 
  Three Months and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 
       
  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  We record all derivative financial instrument contracts at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets except for certain contracts that qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale election. Under this accounting policy election, we do not record the contracts at fair value at each balance sheet date; instead, we record the purchase or sale at the contracted value once the delivery occurs. 
    
  We have not designated any financial instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. All changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments that do not qualify as normal purchases and normal sales (whether cash transactions or non-cash mark-to-market adjustments) are reported within cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, regardless of whether the contract is physically or financially settled. 
    
  We utilize various commodity derivative financial instrument contracts to attempt to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. We do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes. Changes in assets and liabilities from commodity derivative financial instruments result primarily from changes in market prices, newly originated transactions, and the timing of settlements. We attempt to balance our contractual portfolio in terms of notional amounts and timing of performance and delivery obligations. However, net unbalanced positions can exist or are established based on our assessment of anticipated market movements. Inherent in the resulting contractual portfolio are certain business risks, including commodity price risk and credit risk.   Commodity price risk is the risk that the market value of crude oil, natural gas liquids, or refined products will change, either favorably or unfavorably, in response to changing market conditions.     Credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers, customers or financial counterparties to a contract.   Procedures and limits for managing commodity price risks and credit risks are specified in our market risk policy and credit risk policy, respectively.   Open commodity positions and market price changes are monitored daily and are reported to senior management and to marketing operations personnel.   Credit risk is monitored daily and exposure is minimized through customer deposits, restrictions on product liftings, letters of credit, and entering into master netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain transactions. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  We record product sales revenues when title to the product transfers to the purchaser, which typically occurs when the purchaser receives the product. We record terminaling, transportation, storage, and service revenues when the service is performed, and we record tank and other rental revenues over the lease term. Revenues for our Water Solutions segment are recognized when we obtain the wastewater at our treatment and disposal facilities. 
    
  We report taxes collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities, such as sales and use taxes, on a net basis. We include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs in revenues in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We enter into certain contracts whereby we agree to purchase product from a counterparty and sell the same volume of product to the same counterparty at a different location or time. When such agreements are entered into at the same time and in contemplation of each other, we record the revenues for these transactions net of cost of sales. 
    
  Revenues during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   include   $1.2 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, and revenues during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   include   $2.5 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively, associated with the amortization of a liability recorded in the acquisition accounting for an acquired business related to certain out-of-market revenue contracts.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
    
  Investments we cannot control, but can exercise significant influence over, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.   Under the equity method, we do not report the individual assets and liabilities of these entities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets; instead, our ownership interests are reported within investments in unconsolidated entities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Under the equity method, the investment is recorded at acquisition cost, increased by our proportionate share of any earnings and additional capital contributions and decreased by our proportionate share of any losses, distributions paid, and amortization of any excess investment. Excess investment is the amount by which our total investment exceeds our proportionate share of the historical net book value of the net assets of the investee. We use the cumulative earnings approach to classify distributions received from unconsolidated entities as either operating activities or investing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned to     ArcLight     for approximately     $112.4 million     in cash and recorded a gain on disposal of     $104.1 million     during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our investments in unconsolidated entities consist of the following at the dates indicated: 

(1) 
    When we acquired Gavilon, LLC, ( Gavilon Energy ), we recorded the investment in Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC ( Glass Mountain ), which owns a crude oil pipeline in Oklahoma, at fair value. Our investment in Glass Mountain exceeds our proportionate share of the historical net book value of Glass Mountain s net assets by   $73.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  . This difference relates primarily to goodwill and customer relationships. 
               (3) 
    On June 3, 2016, we acquired the remaining     65%     ownership interest in     the water supply company  ,   and as a result,   the water supply company is now consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements (see   Note 4  ). 
       
  Other Noncurrent Assets 
    
  Other noncurrent assets consist of the following at the dates indicated: 

(1) 
    Represents   a loan receivable associated with our financing of the construction of a natural gas liquids facility to be utilized by a third party  . 
              (2) 
    Tank bottoms, which are product volumes required for the operation of storage tanks, are recorded at historical cost. We recover tank bottoms when the storage tanks are removed from service.   At   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , tank bottoms held in third party

terminals consisted of   366,212   barrels and   366,212   barrels of refined products, respectively. Tank bottoms held in terminals we own are included within property, plant and equipment (see   Note 5  ). 
   Accrued Expenses and Other Payables 
    
  Accrued expenses and other payables consist of the following at the dates indicated: 

Sale of General Partner Interest in TLP 
    
  As previously reported, on February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our general partner interest in TLP to ArcLight and deferred a portion of the gain on the sale and will recognize this amount over our future lease payment obligations, which is approximately   seven years  . During the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $7.6 million   and   $15.1 million  , respectively, of the deferred gain in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Within our condensed consolidated balance sheet, the current portion of the deferred gain,   $30.1 million  , is recorded in accrued expenses and other payables and the long-term portion,   $154.4 million  , is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities. 
    
  Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  We have certain consolidated subsidiaries in which outside parties own interests.     The noncontrolling interest shown in our condensed consolidated financial statements represents the other owners  interests in these entities. 
    
  Business Combination Measurement Period 
    
  We record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their acquisition date fair values.   Pursuant to GAAP, an entity is allowed a reasonable period of time (not to exceed one year) to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.   As discussed in   Note 4  , certain of our acquisitions are still within this measurement period, and as a result, the acquisition date fair values we have recorded for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to change. 
    
  Also, as discussed in   Note 4  , we made certain adjustments during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   to our estimates of the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations that occurred during the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016  . 
    
  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-16,  Simplifying the Accounting Adjustments for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  The ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This ASU requires that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The ASU was effective for the Partnership beginning April 1, 2016, and required a prospective method of adoption.

Reclassifications 
    
  We have reclassified certain prior period financial statement information to be consistent with the classification methods used in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not impact previously reported amounts of equity, net income, or cash flows. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses.  The ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The ASU is effective for the Partnership beginning April 1, 2020, and requires a modified retrospective method of adoption, although early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases.  The ASU will replace previous lease accounting guidance in GAAP. The ASU requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. The ASU retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The ASU is effective for the Partnership beginning April 1, 2019, and requires a modified retrospective method of adoption. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  The ASU requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The ASU is effective for the Partnership beginning April 1, 2017, and requires a prospective method of adoption, although early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU is effective for the Partnership beginning April 1, 2018, and allows for both full retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 3 Income (Loss) Per Common Unit 
    
  Our income (loss) per common unit is as follows for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Net income (loss) allocated to the general partner includes distributions to which it is entitled as the holder of incentive distribution rights, which are discussed in   Note 11  . 
       
  The diluted weighted average common units outstanding for the   six months ended September 30, 2016   included   2,803,436   warrants and   10,621   performance units that were considered dilutive for the period. For the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the restricted units were considered antidilutive. For the   six months ended September 30, 2016  , the convertible preferred units were considered antidilutive. 

Note 4   Acquisitions 
    
  Fiscal   Year Ending March 31, 2017 
    
  Water Solutions Facilities 
    
  During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we   acquired     three     water solutions facilities   and paid   $26.9 million   of cash. In addition, we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities within accrued expenses and other payables and other noncurrent liabilities related to future royalty payments due to the sellers of one of these facilities. We estimated the contingent consideration based on the contracted royalty rate, which is a flat rate per disposal barrel and percentage of oil revenues, multiplied by the expected disposal volumes and oil revenue for the expected useful life of the facility and disposal well. This amount was then discounted to present value using our weighted average cost of capital plus a premium representative of the uncertainty associated with the expected disposal volumes and oil revenue. As of the acquisition date, we recorded a contingent liability of   $2.6 million  . Also, for one of these facilities, we have recorded a liability for contingent royalty payments. We estimated the contingent royalty payments based on the contracted royalty rate, which is a flat rate per disposal barrel, multiplied by the expected disposal volumes for the expected useful life of the facility and disposal well. This amount was then discounted to present value using our weighted average cost of capital plus a premium representative of the uncertainty associated with the expected disposal volumes. As of the acquisition date, we recorded a contingent royalty liability of   $8.2 million  .

We are in the process of identifying and determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for these water solutions facilities, and as a result, the estimates of fair value at   September 30, 2016   are subject to change. We expect to complete this process before we issue our financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2017. The following table summarizes the preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands): 

Goodwill represents a premium paid to expand the number of our disposal sites in an oilfield production basin currently serviced by us, thereby enhancing our competitive position as a provider of disposal services in this oilfield production basin. We estimate that all of the goodwill will be deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
    
  Acquisition of Remaining Interest in Water Solutions Facilities 
    
  On September 15, 2016, we   acquired the remaining     25%     ownership interest in     three     water solutions facilities   and paid   $10.0 million   of cash. The acquisition of the remaining interest was accounted for as an equity transaction, no gain or loss was recorded and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was adjusted to reflect the change in ownership interest of the subsidiary. As of the date of the transaction, the   25%   interest had a carrying value of   $7.4 million  . 
    
  Water Pipeline Company 
    
  As discussed below, on January 7, 2016, we acquired a   57.125%   interest in an   existing produced water pipeline company   operating in the Delaware Basin portion of West Texas. On June 3, 2016, we   acquired an additional     24.5%     interest in   this water pipeline company as part of the purchase and sale agreement discussed in   Note 15  . As we control this entity (and continue to retain our controlling financial interest), the acquisition of the additional interest was accounted for as an equity transaction, no gain or loss was recorded and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was adjusted to reflect the change in ownership interest of the subsidiary. As of the date of the transaction, the   24.5%   interest had a carrying value of   $5.2 million  . 
    
  Water Supply Company 
    
  On June 3, 2016, we acquired the remaining     65%     ownership interest in     a water supply company   (see   Note 2  ). In exchange for this additional interest, we paid   $1.0 million   of cash and assumed an outstanding note payable, which relates to money this entity previously borrowed from us.   Prior to the completion of this transaction, we accounted for our previously held     35%   ownership interest   of this water supply company using the equity method of accounting   (see   Note 2  ).   As we now own a controlling interest in this entity, we revalued our previously held     35%     ownership interest to fair value   of   $0.8 million     and recorded a loss of     $14.9 million  , which is recorded within revaluation of investments in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.   As the amount paid (cash plus the fair value of our previously held ownership interest) was less than the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of     $0.6 million   within revaluation of investments in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Retail Propane Businesses 
    
  During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we acquired   three     retail propane businesses   and paid   $72.1 million   of cash and issued   218,617   common units, valued at   $4.0 million  , in exchange for these assets and operations. In connection with the issuance of the common units, we issued   219   general partner units to our general partner and   less than $0.1 million   in order to maintain its 0.1% general partner interest in us. The agreement for these acquisitions contemplate post-closing payments for certain working capital items.

The following table summarizes the preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands): 

Fiscal   Year Ended March 31, 2016 
    
  Pursuant to GAAP, an entity is allowed a reasonable period of time (not to exceed one year) to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. 
    
  Water Pipeline Company 
    
  During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we finalized the purchase price accounting for the   57.125%   interest acquired in a water pipeline company on January 7, 2016. During the   three months ended   June 30, 2016, we recorded an adjustment to reclassify approximately   $1.1 million   from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets, in order to present the fair value of the acquired rights-of-way as an indefinite-lived asset, which is consistent with our historical accounting policies. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an adjustment of   $0.3 million   to other noncurrent liabilities to recognize an asset retirement obligation related to assets that we acquired. This adjustment also increased goodwill by the same amount. There have been no other adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed which were disclosed in our Annual Report. 
    
  Delaware Basin     Water Solutions Facilities 
    
  During the   three months ended   June 30, 2016, we finalized the purchase price accounting for the   four   saltwater disposal facilities and a   50%   interest in an additional saltwater disposal facility in the Delaware Basin of the Permian Basin in Texas we acquired on August 24, 2015. There have been no adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed which were disclosed in our Annual Report.

  During the   three months ended   June 30, 2016, we finalized the purchase price accounting for   nine   water facilities acquired under the development agreement during the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016  . During the   three months ended   June 30, 2016, we received additional information and recorded an adjustment of   $0.7 million   to property, plant and equipment to recognize the fair value of additional assets that we acquired. This adjustment also reduced goodwill by the same amount. In addition, we paid   $1.0 million   in cash to the seller during the   three months ended   June 30, 2016 for consideration that was held back at the acquisition date, which we recorded as a liability to accrued expenses and other payables. 
    
  Retail Propane     Businesses 
    
  During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we finalized the purchase price accounting for   five   retail propane businesses we acquired during the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016   and paid   $0.3 million   in cash to a seller during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   for consideration that was held back at the acquisition date, which we recorded as a liability to accrued expenses and other payables.

Loss on Disposal of Assets 
    
  During the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded losses of   $8.5 million   and   $10.8 million  , respectively, due primarily to the sales and write-down of certain assets in our Crude Oil Logistics and Water Solutions segments. During the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded losses of   $1.1 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, primarily due to the sales of certain assets in our Crude Oil Logistics and Water Solutions segments. These losses are reported within   loss (gain) on disposal or impairment of assets, net   in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill Adjustment to Initial Impairment Estimate 
    
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of   $380.2 million  . During the   three months ended   June 30, 2016, we finalized our goodwill impairment analysis, with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. As a result of finalizing our analysis, we determined that we needed to reverse   $124.7 million   of the previously recorded goodwill impairment recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The reversal was due primarily to the change in the fair value of our customer relationship intangible assets. With the assistance of the third party valuation firm, inputs such as revenue growth rates and attrition rates related to existing customers were refined and resulted in a lower fair value allocated to customer relationships than in our preliminary calculation. We recorded the reversal within   loss (gain) on disposal or impairment of assets, net   in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

    Includes debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). Debt issuance costs related to fixed-rate notes are reported as a reduction of the carrying amount of long-term debt. 
       
  The weighted-average remaining amortization period for intangible assets is approximately   8.6 years  . 
    
  Write off of Intangible Assets 
    
  As a result of terminating the development agreement in the Water Solutions segment (see   Note 15  ), we incurred a loss of   $5.8 million   to write off the water facility development agreement.   During the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we wrote-off     $5.2 million     related to the value of an indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset in conjunction with finalizing our goodwill impairment analysis   (see   Note 6  ). These losses are reported within   loss (gain) on disposal or impairment of assets, net   in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Credit Agreement 
    
  We have entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement includes a revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs (the  Working Capital Facility ) and a revolving credit facility to fund acquisitions and expansion projects (the  Expansion Capital Facility,  and together with the Working Capital Facility, the  Revolving Credit Facility ). At   September 30, 2016  , our Revolving Credit Facility had a total capacity of   $2.484 billion  . Our Revolving Credit Facility has an  accordion  feature that allows us to increase the capacity by   $150 million   if new lenders wish to join the syndicate or if current lenders wish to increase their commitments. 
    
  The Expansion Capital Facility had a total capacity of   $1.446 billion   for cash borrowings at   September 30, 2016  .   At that date, we had outstanding borrowings of     $1.312 billion     on the Expansion Capital Facility.     The Working Capital Facility had a total capacity of     $1.038 billion     for cash borrowings and letters of credit at     September 30, 2016  .   At that date, we had outstanding borrowings of     $710.5 million     and outstanding letters of credit o  f   $75.3 million   on the Working Capital Facility.   Amounts outstanding for letters of credit are not recorded as long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, although they decrease our borrowing capacity under the Working Capital Facility. The capacity available under the Working Capital Facility may be limited by a  borrowing base  (as defined in the Credit Agreement), which is calculated based on the value of certain working capital items at any point in time. 
    
  The commitments under the Credit Agreement expire on November 5, 2018. We have the right to prepay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement without incurring any penalties, and prepayments of principal may be required if we enter into certain transactions to sell assets or obtain new borrowings. 
    
  All borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at either (i) an alternate base rate plus a margin of   0.50%     to     1.75%     per year or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of     1.50%     to     2.75%   per year. The applicable margin is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). At   September 30, 2016  ,   the borrowings under the Credit Agreement had an average interest rate     of     2.83%  ,   calculated as the LIBOR rate of     0.53%     plus a margin of     2.25%     for LIBOR borrowings and the prime rate of     3.50%     plus a margin of     1.25%     on alternate base rate borrowings.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   the interest rate in effect on letters of credit was     2.25%  .   Commitment fees are charged at a rate ranging from     0.38%     to     0.50%   on any unused capacity. 
    
  The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement also specifies that our leverage ratio cannot be more than     4.75     to     1   and that our interest coverage ratio cannot be less than     2.75     to     1     at any quarter end.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   our leverage ratio was approximately     4.15     to     1     and our interest coverage ratio was approximately     4.60     to     1  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  2019 Notes  
    
  On July 9, 2014, we issued     $400.0 million     of     5.125%   Senior Notes Due 2019 (the  2019 Notes ).   During the     three months ended   June 30, 2016  , we repurchased     $5.0 million     of our 2019 Notes for an aggregate purchase price of     $3.1 million     (excluding payments of accrued interest). As a result, we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of our 2019 Notes of     $1.8 million     (net of the write off of debt issuance costs of     $0.1 million  ). 
    
  The 2019 Notes mature on July 15, 2019. Interest is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year. We have the right to redeem the 2019 Notes before the maturity date, although we would be required to pay a premium for early redemption. 
    
  At     September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the 2019 Notes. 
    
  2021 Notes    
    
  On October 16, 2013, we issued     $450.0 million     of     6.875%     Senior Notes Due 2021 (the  2021 Notes ).   During the     three months ended   June 30, 2016  ,     we repurchased     $19.2 million     of our 2021 Notes for an aggregate purchase price of     $12.0 million     (excluding payments of accrued interest). As a result, we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of our 2021 Notes of     $6.8 million     (net of the write off of debt issuance costs of     $0.4 million  ).

The 2021 Notes mature on October 15, 2021. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. We have the right to redeem the 2021 Notes before the maturity date, although we would be required to pay a premium for early redemption. 
    
  At     September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. 
    
  2022 Notes 
    
  On June 19, 2012, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (as amended, the  Note Purchase Agreement ) whereby we issued     $250.0 million     of Senior Notes in a private placement (the  2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of     6.65%  ,   which is payable quarterly. The 2022 Notes are required to be repaid in semi-annual installments of     $25.0 million     beginning on December 19, 2017 and ending on the maturity date of June 19, 2022.     We have the option to prepay outstanding principal, although we would incur a prepayment penalty.     On September 30, 2016, we amended our Note Purchase Agreement which, among other things, changes the maximum allowable leverage ratio to match the maximum allowable leverage ratio and the calculation of such ratio under our Credit Agreement. Additionally, the amendment provides for an increase in interest charged should our leverage ratio exceed certain predetermined levels.   The 2022 Notes are secured by substantially all of our assets and rank equal in priority with borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  At     September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with the covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement. 
    
  Other Long-Term Debt 
    
  We have certain notes payable related to equipment financing. We have also executed various noninterest bearing notes payable, primarily related to non-compete agreements entered into in connection with acquisitions of businesses. These instruments have a combined principal balance of   $59.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and the interest rates on these instruments range from   1.17%   to   7.08%   per year. 
    
  Debt Maturity Schedule 
    
  The scheduled maturities of our long-term debt are as follows at   September 30, 2016  : 

Note 9 Income Taxes 
    
  We qualify as a partnership for income tax purposes. As such, we generally do not pay United States federal income tax. Rather, each owner reports his or her share of our income or loss on his or her individual tax return. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined, as we do not have access to information regarding each partner s basis in the Partnership. 
    
  We have certain taxable corporate subsidiaries in the United States and in Canada, and our operations in Texas are subject to a state franchise tax that is calculated based on revenues net of cost of sales. Our fiscal years 2013 to 2016 generally remain subject to examination by federal, state, and Canadian tax authorities. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years

in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in tax rates are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
    
  A publicly traded partnership is required to generate at least   90%   of its gross income (as defined for federal income tax purposes) from certain qualifying sources. Income generated by our taxable corporate subsidiaries is excluded from this qualifying income calculation. Although we routinely generate income outside of our corporate subsidiaries that is non-qualifying, we believe that at least   90%   of our gross income has been qualifying income for each of the calendar years since our initial public offering. 
    
  We evaluate uncertain tax positions for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. To recognize a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. We had no material uncertain tax positions that required recognition in our condensed consolidated financial statements at   September 30, 2016   or   March 31, 2016  . 

Note 10   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal Contingencies 
    
  We are party to various claims, legal actions, and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of our management, the ultimate resolution of these claims, legal actions, and complaints, after consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage, and other arrangements, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently uncertain, and estimates of our liabilities may change materially as circumstances develop. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  Our condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   includes a liability, measured on an undiscounted basis, of   $2.2 million   related to environmental matters, which is reported within accrued expenses and other payables. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, risks of additional costs and liabilities are inherent in our business, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies thereunder, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from the operations, could result in substantial costs. Accordingly, we have adopted policies, practices, and procedures in the areas of pollution control, product safety, occupational health, and the handling, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials designed to prevent material environmental or other damage, and to limit the financial liability that could result from such events. However, some risk of environmental or other damage is inherent in our business. 
    
  As previously disclosed, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) had informed NGL Crude Logistics, LLC, formerly known as Gavilon, LLC (hereafter referred to as  Gavilon ) of alleged violations in 2011 by Gavilon of the Clean Air Act s renewable fuel standards regulations (prior to its acquisition by NGL in December 2013). On October 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice, acting at the request of the EPA, filed a civil complaint in the Northern District of Iowa against Gavilon and one of its then suppliers, Western Dubuque Biodiesel LLC ( Western Dubuque ). Consistent with the earlier allegations by the EPA, the civil complaint relates to transactions between Gavilon and Western Dubuque and the generation of biodiesel renewable identification numbers ( RINs ) sold by Western Dubuque to Gavilon in 2011. The complaint seeks an order declaring that the RINs generated by Western Dubuque be declared invalid, that the defendants retire and replace such RINs and that the defendants pay statutory civil penalties. Consistent with our position against the previous EPA allegations, we deny the allegations in this civil complaint and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the civil action. However, at this time NGL is unable to determine the outcome of this action or its significance to us.

Asset Retirement Obligations 
    
  We have contractual and regulatory obligations at certain facilities for which we have to perform remediation, dismantlement, or removal activities when the assets are retired. Our liability for asset retirement obligations is discounted to present value. To calculate the liability, we make estimates and assumptions about the retirement cost and the timing of retirement. Changes in our assumptions and estimates may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. The following table is a rollforward of our asset retirement obligation, which is reported within other noncurrent liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets (in thousands): 

In addition to the obligations discussed above, we may be obligated to remove facilities or perform other remediation upon retirement of certain other assets. We do not believe the present value of these asset retirement obligations, under current laws and regulations, after taking into consideration the estimated lives of our facilities, is material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Operating Leases 
    
  We have executed various noncancelable operating lease agreements for product storage, office space, vehicles, real estate, railcars, and equipment. The following table summarizes future minimum lease payments under these agreements at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Rental expense relating to operating leases was   $27.0 million   and   $33.3 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $56.9 million   and   $67.1 million   during the   six months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Pipeline Capacity Agreements 
    
  We have executed noncancelable agreements with crude oil and refined products pipeline operators, which guarantee us minimum monthly shipping capacity on the pipelines. As a result, we are required to pay the minimum shipping fees if actual shipments are less than our allotted capacity.   The following table summarizes future minimum throughput payments under these agreements at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

Sales and Purchase Contracts 
    
  We have entered into product sales and purchase contracts for which we expect the parties to physically settle and deliver the inventory in future periods. The following table summarizes such commitments at   September 30, 2016  : 

We account for the contracts shown in the table above as normal purchases and normal sales. Under this accounting policy election, we do not record the contracts at fair value at each balance sheet date; instead, we record the purchase or sale at the contracted value once the delivery occurs. Contracts in the table above may have offsetting derivative contracts (as discussed in   Note 12  ) or inventory positions (as discussed in   Note 2  ). 
    
  Certain other forward purchase and sale contracts do not qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale election. These contracts are recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and are not included in the table above. These contracts are included in the derivative disclosures in   Note 12  , and represent   $41.0 million   of our prepaid expenses and other current assets and   $29.6 million   of our accrued expenses and other payables at   September 30, 2016  . 

Note 11   Equity 
    
  Partnership Equity 
    
  The Partnership s equity consists of a   0.1%   general partner interest and a   99.9%   limited partner interest, which consists of common units. Our general partner has the right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its 0.1% general partner interest. Our general partner is not required to guarantee or pay any of our debts and obligations. 
    
  Our Distributions 
    
  The following table summarizes distributions declared for the last three quarters: 

Class A Convertible Preferred Units 
    
  On April 21, 2016, we entered into a private placement agreement to issue   $200 million   of   10.75%   Class A Convertible Preferred Units ( Preferred Units ) to Oaktree Capital Management L.P. and its co-investors ( Oaktree ). On June 23, 2016, the private placement agreement was amended to increase the aggregate principal amount from   $200 million   to   $240

million  . On May 11, 2016, we received an initial   $100 million   ( initial closing date ) and Oaktree received   8,309,237   Preferred Units, and on June 24, 2016, we received the remaining   $140 million   ( second closing date ) and Oaktree received   11,632,932   Preferred Units. In addition, Oaktree received   4,375,112   warrants (  1,822,963   at the initial closing date and   2,552,149   at the second closing date) to purchase common units at an exercise price of   $0.01   per common unit. 
    
  We will pay a cumulative, quarterly distribution in arrears at an annual rate of   10.75%   on the Preferred Units then outstanding in cash, to the extent declared by the board of directors of our general partner. To the extent declared, such distributions will be paid for each such quarter within   45   days after each quarter end. On   July 22, 2016  , we declared a pro rata distribution for the three months ended June 30, 2016 of   $1.8 million   which was paid to the holders of the Preferred Units on   August 12, 2016  . On   October 20, 2016  , we declared a distribution for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   of   $6.4 million   to be paid to the holders of the Preferred Units on   November 14, 2016  . 
    
  If the Preferred Unit quarterly distribution is not made in full in cash for any quarter, the Preferred Unit distribution rate will increase by one quarter of a percentage point (  0.25%  ) per annum beginning with distributions for the first   six  -month period that a payment default is in effect, and will further increase by an additional one quarter of a percentage point (  0.25%  ) beginning with distributions for the next   six  -month period during which a payment default remains in effect. The deficiency rate shall not exceed   11.25%   per annum; as long as the default is occurring, the amount of accrued but unpaid Preferred Unit quarterly distributions shall increase at an annual rate of   10.75%  , compounded quarterly, until paid in full. 
    
  The Preferred Units have no mandatory redemption date but are redeemable, at our election, any time after the first anniversary of the closing date. We have the right to redeem all of the outstanding Preferred Units at a price per Preferred Unit equal to the purchase price multiplied by the redemption multiple then in effect. The redemption multiple means (a)   140%   for redemptions occurring on or after the first, but prior to the second anniversary of the closing date, (b)   115%   for the redemptions occurring on or after the second, but prior to the third anniversary of the closing date, (c)   110%   for redemptions occurring on or after the third, but prior to the eighth anniversary of the closing date and (d)   101%   for redemptions occurring on or after the eighth anniversary of the closing date. 
    
  At any time after the third anniversary of the initial closing date, the Preferred Unit holders shall have the right to convert all of the outstanding Preferred Units at a price per Preferred Unit equal to the purchase price multiplied by the conversion multiple then in effect, which may be settled in common units, cash or a combination, at our discretion. The conversion multiple means if our common units are trading at or above   $12.035   ( the initial conversion price ), the conversion price is not adjusted. However, if the conversion price is less than the initial conversion price, the conversion price will be reset to the greater of (i) the adjusted volume weighted average price of our common units for the   fifteen   trading days immediately preceding the third anniversary of the closing date or (ii)   $5.00  . 
    
  Upon a change of control of the Partnership, each Preferred Unit holder shall have the right, at its election, to either (i) elect to have its Preferred Units converted to common units; (ii) if we are the surviving entity of such change of control, it can elect to continue to hold its Preferred Units; or (iii) require us to redeem its Preferred Units for cash equal to (a) prior to the first anniversary of the closing date,   140%   of the unit purchase price; (b) on or after the first but prior to the second anniversary of the closing date,   130%   of the unit purchase price; (c) on or after the second anniversary of the closing date,   120%   of the unit purchase price; and (d) thereafter,   101%   of the unit purchase price. In each case, this amount will include any accrued but unpaid distributions at the redemption date. 
    
  Under the private placement agreement, we are required to file within   180   days of the initial closing date a registration statement registering the resales of common units issued or to be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Units or exercise of the warrants and have the registration statement declared effective within   360   days after the closing date. We are required to continue to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement until all securities have been sold. If the registration statement is not effective before the deadline, then the Preferred Unit holders shall be entitled to liquidated damages. The liquidated damages, which would accrue daily, are an amount equal to   0.25%   of the multiplier for the first 60 day period following the effectiveness deadline plus an additional   0.25%   of the multiplier for each subsequent 30 day period (i.e.   0.50%   for 61-90 days,   0.75%   for 91-120 days and   1.00%   thereafter) up to a maximum of   1.00%   of the liquidated damage multiplier per 30 day period, until the registration statement becomes effective or the Preferred Units are sold. 
    
  The warrants have an   eight   year term, after which unexercised warrants will expire. The holders of the warrants may convert one-third of the warrants from and after the first anniversary of the original issue date, another one-third of the warrants from and after the second anniversary of the original issue date and the final one-third may be converted from and after the

third anniversary. Upon a change of control or in the event we exercise our redemption right with respect to the Preferred Units, all unvested warrants shall immediately vest and be exercisable in full. 
    
  We received net proceeds of   $235.0 million   (net of offering costs of   $5.0 million  ) in connection with the issuance of Preferred Units and warrants. We allocated these net proceeds, on a relative fair value basis, to the Preferred Units (  $186.4 million  ), which includes the value of the beneficial conversion feature, and warrants (  $48.6 million  ). As discussed below,   $131.5 million   of the amount allocated to the Preferred Units is allocated to the intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. Per the applicable accounting guidance, we are required to allocate a portion of the proceeds allocated to the Preferred Units to the beneficial conversion feature based on the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature. The intrinsic value is calculated at the commitment date based on the difference between the fair value of the common units at the issuance date (number of common units issuable at conversion multiplied by the per share value of our common units at the issuance date) and the proceeds attributed to the Preferred Units. We record the accretion attributed to the beneficial conversion feature as a deemed distribution using the effective interest method over the   three   year period prior to the effective dates of the holders  conversion right. Accretion for the beneficial conversion feature was   $2.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $3.8 million   for the   six months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As discussed above, the Preferred Units are not mandatorily redeemable but are redeemable upon a change of control, which was not certain to occur at the issuance of the Preferred Units. Due to the redemption being conditioned upon an event that is not certain to occur or that is not under our control, we are required to record the value allocated to the Preferred Units, excluding the value of the beneficial conversion feature, between liabilities and equity (mezzanine or temporary equity) within our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The value allocated to the warrants and the beneficial conversion feature were recorded as part of Limited Partners  equity within our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement 
    
  On June 24, 2016, NGL Energy Holdings LLC executed the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership. The preferences, rights, powers and duties of holders of the Preferred Units are defined in the amended and restated partnership agreement. The Preferred Units rank senior to the common units, with respect to the payment of distributions and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up. The Preferred Units have no stated maturity and are not subject to mandatory redemption or any sinking fund and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by the Partnership or converted into common units at the election of the Partnership or the Preferred Unit holders or in connection with a change of control. 
    
  At-The-Market Program 
    
  On August 24, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution program in connection with an     at-the-market program (the  ATM Program )     pursuant to which we may issue and sell common units for up to     $200.0 million     in gross proceeds.     This ATM Program is registered with the   SEC   on an effective registration statement on Form S-3.     During the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we sold     524,000     common units for proceeds of     $9.6 million  ,   net of offering costs of     less than $0.1 million  .   In connection with the issuance of the common units, we issued     524     general partner units to our general partner and     less than $0.1 million     in order to maintain its     0.1%     general partner interest in us.   As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $190.4 million   remained available for sale under the Partnership s ATM Program. 
    
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we sold an additional     192,000     common units for proceeds of     $3.7 million  , net of offering costs of     less than $0.1 million  . 
    
  Equity-Based Incentive Compensation 
    
  Our general partner has adopted a long-term incentive plan ( LTIP ), which allows for the issuance of equity-based compensation. Our general partner has granted certain restricted units to employees and directors, which vest in tranches, subject to the continued service of the recipients. The awards may also vest in the event of a change in control, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner.   No   distributions accrue to or are paid on the restricted units during the vesting period.

The restricted units include awards that vest contingent on the continued service of the recipients through the vesting date (the  Service Awards ). The restricted units also include awards that are contingent both on the continued service of the recipients through the vesting date and also on the performance of our common units relative to other entities in the Alerian MLP Index (the  Index ) over specified periods of time (the  Performance Awards ). 
    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we changed our process for how taxes are withheld upon the vesting of restricted units. Previously, employees could choose to pay cash for their portion of the taxes or have us withhold enough units to meet their tax withholding requirements. Employees could also elect to have the units withheld to exceed the statutory minimums. Now, employees will still be able to pay cash to satisfy their tax obligation or they can elect to sell enough units, through a broker assisted cashless exercise program, to meet their tax obligation. As a result of this change in process, the unvested restricted units and future grants are eligible for equity classification. Prior to this change in process, we classified any Service Awards or Performance Awards granted as liabilities and were required to recalculate the fair value of the award at each reporting date. Awards classified as equity are valued only at their grant date and are not revalued at each reporting date. As of June 30, 2016, we had liabilities related to our Service Awards and Performance Awards of   $25.6 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively, which we reclassified to equity. 
    
  The following table summarizes the Service Award activity during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

The following table summarizes the scheduled vesting of our unvested Service Award units: 

Service Awards are valued at the market price as of the date of grant less the present value of the expected distribution stream over the vesting period using a risk-free interest rate. We record the expense for each Service Award on a straight-line basis over the requisite period for the entire award (that is, over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of the award), ensuring that the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date must at least equal the portion of the grant-date value of the award that is vested at that date. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded compensation expense related to Service Award units of   $25.8 million   and   $14.9 million  , respectively. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded compensation expense related to Service Award units of   $46.7 million   and   $33.4 million  , respectively. 
    
  Of the restricted units granted and vested during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   1,008,091   units were granted as a bonus for performance during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. We accrued expense of   $16.8 million   during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as an estimate of the value of such bonus units that would be granted. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an additional   $2.2 million   to true up the estimate to the   $19.0 million   of actual expense associated with these bonuses. Since the units were not formally granted until August 2016, the full   $19.0 million   is reflected in the expense during the three months and six months ended   September 30, 2016   in the amounts in the preceding paragraph above.

The following table summarizes the estimated future expense we expect to record on the unvested Service Award units at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

During April 2015, our general partner granted Performance Award units to certain employees. The number of Performance Award units that will vest is contingent on the performance of our common units relative to the performance of the other entities in the Index. Performance will be calculated based on the return on our common units (including changes in the market price of the common units and distributions paid during the performance period) relative to the returns on the common units of the other entities in the Index. As of   September 30, 2016  , performance will be measured over the following periods: 

The following table summarizes the percentage of the maximum Performance Award units that will vest depending on the percentage of entities in the Index that NGL outperforms: 

The following table summarizes the Performance Award activity during the six months ended September 30, 2016: 

During the July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2016 performance period, the return on our common units was below the return of the   50th   percentile of our peer companies in the Index. As a result,   no   units vested on July 1, 2016 and are considered to be forfeited. 
    
  We record the expense for each of the tranches of the Performance Awards on a straight-line basis over the period beginning with the grant date and ending with the vesting date of the tranche. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded compensation expense related to Performance Award units of   $1.6 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded compensation expense related to Performance Award units of   $3.1 million   and   $18.1 million  , respectively.

The following table summarizes the estimated future expense we expect to record on the unvested Performance Award units at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

The number of common units that may be delivered pursuant to awards under the LTIP is limited to   10%   of the issued and outstanding common units. The maximum number of units deliverable under the LTIP plan automatically increases to   10%   of the issued and outstanding common units immediately after each issuance of common units, unless the plan administrator determines to increase the maximum number of units deliverable by a lesser amount. Units withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations are not considered to be delivered under the LTIP. In addition, when an award is forfeited, canceled, exercised, paid or otherwise terminates or expires without the delivery of units, the units subject to such award are again available for new awards under the LTIP. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   1.1 million   common units remain available for issuance under the LTIP. 

Note 12   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current assets and liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. 
    
  Commodity Derivatives 
    
  The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the dates indicated:

The following table summarizes our open commodity derivative contract positions at the dates indicated. We do not account for these derivatives as hedges. 

(1) 
    We may purchase or sell a physical commodity where the underlying contract pricing mechanisms are tied to different commodity price indices. These contracts are derivatives we have entered into as an economic hedge against the risk of one commodity price moving relative to another commodity price. 
              (2) 
    We may have fixed price physical purchases, including inventory, offset by floating price physical sales or floating price physical purchases offset by fixed price physical sales. These contracts are derivatives we have entered into as an economic hedge against the risk of mismatches between fixed and floating price physical obligations. 
       
  During the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   a net gain   of   $14.7 million   and   a net loss   of   $45.0 million  , respectively, and during the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded net gains of   $85.8 million   and   $44.5 million  , respectively, from our commodity derivatives to cost of sales. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  We have credit policies that we believe minimize our overall credit risk, including an evaluation of potential counterparties  financial condition (including credit ratings), collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and the use of industry standard master netting agreements, which allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain transactions.   At     September 30, 2016  ,   our primary counterparties were retailers, resellers, energy marketers, producers, refiners, and dealers.   This concentration of counterparties may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, as the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. If a counterparty does not perform on a contract, we may not realize amounts that have been recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and recognized in our net income.

Interest Rate Risk    
    
  Our Revolving Credit Facility is variable-rate debt with interest rates that are generally indexed to bank prime or LIBOR interest rates.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   we had     $2.0 billion     of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility at an average interest rate of     2.83%  . 
    
  Fair Value of Fixed-Rate Notes 
    
  The following table provides fair value estimates of our fixed-rate notes at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

For the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the fair value estimates were developed based on publicly traded quotes and would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. For the 2022 Notes, the fair value estimate was developed using observed yields on publicly traded notes issued by us, adjusted for differences in the key terms of those notes and the key terms of our notes (examples include differences in the tenor of the debt, credit standing of the issuer, whether the notes are publicly traded, and whether the notes are secured or unsecured). This fair value estimate would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

We also have a loan receivable of   $1.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   from an equity method investee with an initial maturity date of March 31, 2021, which can be extended for successive   one  -year periods unless one of the parties terminates the loan agreement. 
    
  We had a loan receivable of   $22.3 million   at   March 31, 2016   from an equity method investee. During the   three months ended   June 30, 2016, we received loan payments of   $0.7 million   from our investee in accordance with the loan agreement.   During the     three months ended   June 30, 2016,   we recorded an impairment of     $1.7 million     related to   this   loan receivable  .   On June 3, 2016, we acquired the remaining     65%     ownership interest in   this equity method investee (see   Note 4  ) and this loan receivable is now eliminated upon consolidation. 

Note 15   Other Matters 
    
  Purchase of Pipeline Capacity Allocations 
    
  On certain interstate refined product pipelines, shipment demand exceeds available capacity, and capacity is allocated to shippers based on their historical shipment volumes. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid   $42.0 million     to acquire certain refined product pipeline capacity allocations from other shippers on the Colonial pipeline  . 
    
  Termination of Development Agreement 
    
  On June 3, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the counterparty to the development agreement in our Water Solutions segment (as discussed in   Note 4  ). Total cash consideration paid under the agreement was   $49.6 million  ,

of which   $2.1 million   was withheld and recorded in accrued expenses and other payables as of June 30, 2016, and in return we received the following: 

Termination of the development agreement (see   Note 4  ); 
                
    Additional interest in the water pipeline company we acquired in January 2016 (see   Note 4  ); 
                
    Release of contingent consideration liabilities (see   Note 4  ) attributed to certain of our water treatment and disposal facilities; 
                
    Certain parcels of land and permits to develop saltwater disposal wells and other parcels of land containing water wells and equipment; and 
                
    A   two  -year non-compete agreement with the counterparty. 
       
  We accounted for the transaction as an acquisition of assets. Acquiring assets in groups requires not only ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net asset) group but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. The cost of a group of assets acquired in an asset acquisition shall be allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed/released based on their relative fair values and shall not give rise to goodwill or bargain purchase gains. We allocated   $1.2 million   of the total consideration to property, plant and equipment,   $3.3 million   to intangible assets,   $2.8 million   to noncontrolling interest,   $25.5 million   to the release of contingent consideration liabilities and   $16.9 million   to the termination of the development agreement. We recorded a   $21.3 million   gain on the release of   $46.8 million   of contingent consideration liabilities, which was recorded within gain on early extinguishment of liabilities in our condensed consolidated statement of operations during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  . For the termination of the development agreement,   we recorded a loss   of   $22.7 million  ,   which included the carrying value of the development agreement asset that was written off (see     Note 7  ). This loss was recorded within   loss (gain) on disposal or impairment of assets, net   in our condensed consolidated statement of operations during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

Note 16 Subsequent Events 
    
  2023 Notes 
    
  In October 2016, we issued     $700.0 million     of Senior Unsecured Notes (the  2023 Notes ) in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. We received net proceeds of approximately     $688.0 million  , after the initial purchasers  discount of     $10.5 million     and estimated offering costs of     $1.5 million  .   We used the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility.    
    
  The 2023 Notes mature on November 1, 2023 and bear interest at a fixed rate of     7.50%  , payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year.    

Note 17 Condensed Consolidating Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Financial Information 
    
  Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes (see   Note 8  ).

  During the periods presented in the tables below, the status of certain subsidiaries changed, in that they either became guarantors of or ceased to be guarantors of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes. Such changes have been given retrospective application in the tables below. 
    
  There are no significant restrictions that prevent the parent or any of the guarantor subsidiaries from obtaining funds from their respective subsidiaries by dividend or loan. None of the assets of the guarantor subsidiaries (other than the

  The following is a discussion of NGL Energy Partners LP s ( we,   us,   our,  or the  Partnership ) financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2016  . The discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Quarterly Report ), as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016   ( Annual Report ). 

Overview 
    
  We are   a Delaware limited partnership  .   NGL Energy Holdings LLC serves as our general partner.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   our operations include: 

Our Crude Oil Logistics segment, the assets of which include owned and leased crude oil storage terminals and pipeline injection stations, a fleet of owned trucks and trailers, a fleet of owned and leased railcars, a fleet of owned barges and towboats, and interests in     two     crude oil pipelines,     purchases crude oil from producers and transports it to refineries or for resale at owned and leased pipeline injection stations, storage terminals, barge loading facilities, rail facilities, refineries, and other trade hubs.

Correction of Error 
    
  As previously reported, subsequent to the issuance of certain previously issued financial statements, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we determined that there were errors in those financial statements from not recording certain contingent consideration liabilities related to royalty agreements assumed as part of acquisitions in our Water Solutions segment.     The effect of the error was material to the financial statements for each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, so those quarters have been restated for the effects of the error correction.     We have restated our previously issued condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three months and     six months ended     September 30, 2015   and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   six months ended     September 30, 2015  .   See Note 17   to our consolidated financial statements   in our Annual Report     for a summary of the impact of the error correction for the three months and     six months ended     September 30, 2015  . 

Recent Developments 
    
  At-The-Market Program 
    
  On August 24, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution program in connection with an     at-the-market program (the  ATM Program )     pursuant to which we may issue and sell common units for up to     $200.0 million     in gross proceeds.   See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion. 
    
  2023 Notes 
    
  In October 2016, we issued     $700.0 million     of Senior Unsecured Notes (the  2023 Notes ) in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. We received net proceeds of approximately     $688.0 million  , after the initial purchasers  discount of     $10.5 million     and estimated offering costs of     $1.5 million  .   We used the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  The 2023 Notes mature on November 1, 2023 and bear interest at a fixed rate of     7.50%  , payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. 

Acquisitions 
    
  As discussed below, we completed numerous acquisitions during the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016   and the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  . These acquisitions impact the comparability of our results of operations between periods in our current and prior fiscal years. 
    
  Fiscal   Year Ending March 31, 2017 
    
  During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , in our Water Solutions segment, we (i)   acquired     three     water solutions facilities  , (ii)   acquired the remaining     25%     ownership interest in     three     water solutions facilities  , (iii)   acquired an additional     24.5%     interest in   an   existing produced water pipeline company  , and (iv) acquired the remaining   65%     ownership interest in     a water supply company  . During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , in our Retail Propane segment, we acquired   three     retail propane businesses  . See   Note 4   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion. 
    
  Fiscal   Year Ended March 31, 2016 
    
  During the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016  , in our Water Solutions segment, we (i) acquired a   57.125%   interest in an existing water pipeline company and (ii) acquired   20   water solutions facilities and a   50%   interest in an additional facility. During the fiscal   year ended March 31, 2016  , in our Retail Propane segment, we acquired   six   retail propane businesses. See   Note 4   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
    
  The following table summarizes our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated: 

Items Impacting the Comparability of Our Financial Results 
    
  Our current and future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the periods presented, due to business combinations. We have expanded our Water Solutions business considerably through numerous acquisitions of water treatment and disposal facilities. We have expanded our Retail Propane business through numerous acquisitions of retail propane businesses.   As previously reported, on February 1, 2016, we sold our general partner interest in TLP.     As a result, on February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP and began to account for our limited partner investment in TLP using the equity method of accounting.   On April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units that we owned. The results of operations of our Liquids and Retail Propane businesses are impacted by seasonality, due primarily to the increase in volumes sold during the peak heating season from October through March. In addition, product price fluctuations can have a significant impact on our sales volumes and revenues. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for the three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for future periods or for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. See the detailed discussion of items affecting operating income (loss) by segment below. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to financial results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), we have provided the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other entities, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. 

51 

     Table of Contents  

We define   EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to NGL Energy Partners LP, plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization expense.   We define   Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, lower of cost or market adjustments, gains and losses on disposal or impairment of assets, gain on early extinguishment of liabilities, revaluation of investments, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition expense and other.   We also include in Adjusted EBITDA certain inventory valuation adjustments related to our Refined Products and Renewables segment, as discussed below.   EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income, income before income taxes, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP as those items are used to measure operating performance, liquidity or the ability to service debt obligations.   We believe   that EBITDA provides additional information to investors for evaluating   our   ability to make quarterly distributions to   our   unitholders and is presented solely as a supplemental measure.   We believe   that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors for evaluating   our   financial performance without regard to   our   financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis.     Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as   we define them,   may not be comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, or similarly titled measures used by other entities. 
    
  Other than for   our   Refined Products and Renewables segment, for purposes of   our   Adjusted EBITDA calculation,   we make   a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives.     During the period when a derivative contract is open,   we record   changes in the fair value of the derivative as an unrealized gain or loss.     When a derivative contract matures or is settled,   we reverse   the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss and record a realized gain or loss.   We do   not draw such a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives of   our   Refined Products and Renewables segment.     The primary hedging strategy of   our   Refined Products and Renewables segment is to hedge against the risk of declines in the value of inventory over the course of the contract cycle, and many of the hedges are six months to one year in duration at inception.     The  inventory valuation adjustment  row in the reconciliation table     reflects the difference between the market value of the inventory of     our     Refined Products and Renewables segment at the balance sheet date and its cost.   We include   this in Adjusted EBITDA because the gains and losses associated with derivative contracts of this segment, which are intended primarily to hedge inventory holding risk, also affect Adjusted EBITDA. 
    
  The following table reconciles   net (loss) income   to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Amount     reflects the difference between the market value of the inventory of     our     Refined Products and Renewables segment at the balance sheet date and its cost.     See  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section above for a further discussion. 
              (2) 
    Equity-based compensation expense in the table above may differ from equity-based compensation expense reported in     Note 11     to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report  .   Amounts reported in the table above include expense

accruals for bonuses expected to be paid in common units, whereas the amounts reported in     Note 11   to our condensed consolidated financial statements only include expenses associated with equity-based awards that have been formally granted. 
           (3) 
    During the   three months and   six months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  ,   we incurred     expenses related to legal and advisory costs associated with acquisitions. 
              (4) 
    Amounts for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2016 represent non-cash operating expenses related to our Grand Mesa Pipeline project and adjustments related to noncontrolling interests. Amounts for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2015 represent the non-cash valuation adjustment of contingent consideration liabilities, offset by the cash payments, related to royalty agreements acquired as part of acquisitions in our Water Solutions segment.

Segment Operating Results for the     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Crude Oil Logistics 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Crude Oil Logistics segment for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Revenues include     $1.3 million     and     $2.3 million     of intersegment sales during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  ,   respectively, that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
       
  Crude Oil Sales.     The     decrease     in revenue per barrel was due primarily to the sharp decline in crude oil prices since July 2014.     The     decrease     in our sales volumes was due primarily to increased competition due to the continued crude oil production decline.     In addition, we also had an increase in buy/sell transactions during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   compared to the     three months ended     September 30, 2015  .   These are transactions in which we transact to purchase product from a counterparty and sell the same volumes of product to the same counterparty at a different location or time. As the revenues and costs of sales are netted for these transaction, so are the volumes. 
    
  Crude Oil Transportation and Other Revenues.     The     decrease     was due primarily to the flattening of the contango curve for crude oil (a condition in which forward crude oil prices are greater than spot prices) during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the     three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   and lower revenues in our trucking and barge operations during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016     due to a general slowdown in demand for transportation services, compared to the     three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Cost of Sales.     Our cost of sales during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016     was     reduced   by   $2.7 million   of   net realized gains   on derivatives and   increased   by   $1.6 million   of   net unrealized losses   on derivatives.   Our cost of sales during the     three months ended     September 30, 2015   was reduced by $13.4 million of net realized gains on derivatives and increased by $1.5 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives.   During the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   our cost of sales also decreased due to the decline in crude oil prices and the decrease in volumes due to increased competition.    
    
  Operating and General and Administrative Expenses  .     The     decrease     was due primarily to lower compensation expense related to a reduction in the number of employees as a result of organizational changes and lower repair and maintenance expense due to having a newer fleet of barges and the timing of repairs.  
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense.     The     decrease     was due primarily to certain intangible assets being fully amortized during the fiscal     year ended March 31, 2016  . 
  
    56 

     Table of Contents  

Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net  . During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded a loss of   $4.8 million   on the sales of certain assets and a loss of   $3.7 million   due to the write-down of certain other assets. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded a loss of   $1.1 million   on the sales of certain assets. 

Water Solutions 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Water Solutions segment for the periods indicated: 

The following tables summarize activity separated between the following categories: 

facilities we owned before   June 30, 2015,   which we refer to below as  existing facilities  and 
                
    facilities we acquired or developed after   June 30, 2015,   which we refer to below as  recently acquired or developed facilities . 
       
  Service Fee Revenues.     The following table summarizes our service fee revenues (in thousands, except per barrel amounts) for the periods indicated: 

57 

     Table of Contents  

The     decrease     in the volume processed at our existing facilities was due primarily to a slowdown in customer production as a result of the lower crude oil prices, as well as migration of volumes from existing facilities to recently developed or acquired facilities due to the location of the new facilities. 
    
  Recovered Hydrocarbon Revenues.     The following table summarizes our recovered hydrocarbon revenues (in thousands, except per barrel amounts) for the periods indicated: 

The     decrease     in revenue per barrel associated with recovered hydrocarbons was due primarily to the sharp decline in crude oil prices since July 2014 and     a decrease     in the amount of hydrocarbons per barrel of water processed. 
    
  Other Revenues.     Other revenues include solids disposal revenues, freshwater revenues, water pipeline revenues and other revenues.   The     increase     was due primarily to   an   increase     in revenues in the freshwater and water pipeline businesses. 
    
  Cost of Sales-Derivatives  .     We enter into derivatives in our Water Solutions segment to protect against the risk of a decline in the market price of the hydrocarbons we expected to recover when processing the wastewater.     Our cost of sales during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016     included     $2.2 million   of   net unrealized gains   on derivatives and   $0.2 million   of   net realized gains   on derivatives.   Our cost of sales during the     three months ended     September 30, 2015     included   $4.4 million of net realized gains on derivatives and $4.2 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives. 
    
  Cost of Sales-Other  .     The     increase     was due to trucking expenses to bring wastewater to our water solutions facilities. 
    
  Operating Expenses  .     The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands, except per barrel amounts) for the periods indicated: 

The     decrease     in operating expenses for existing facilities was due primarily to     lower     operating costs of water disposal wells at existing facilities due to     lower     volumes processed and cost reduction efforts. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  .     Of the     increase  , $2.2 million   related to recently acquired or developed water treatment and disposal facilities and   $0.3 million   related to recently developed solids processing facilities. 
    
  Revaluation of Liabilities.     The revaluation of liabilities represents the valuation adjustment of contingent consideration liabilities related to royalty agreements acquired as part of certain business combinations during the     three months ended     September 30, 2015  .   During the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we did not identify any significant changes in our Water Solutions operations, which would require a revaluation of the contingent consideration obligation, and as such, no adjustment was recorded. 

58 

Table of Contents  

Liquids 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Liquids segment for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Revenues include   $11.1 million   and   $10.7 million   of intersegment sales during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
       
  Propane Sales.   Propane margins are higher due to selling favorable weighted cost of inventory values into a contango market. Sales volumes of propane are lower due to the lack of demand by wholesalers who entered into the current supply season with high inventory levels from the previous contract season and lack of opportunities in the spot market. We continue to be impacted by lower propane demand as a result of warmer temperatures in the prior year.  
    
  Our cost of wholesale propane sales was reduced by $0.1 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and increased by less than $0.1 million of net realized losses on derivatives during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , our cost of wholesale propane sales was reduced by less than $0.1 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and increased by $0.7 million of net realized losses on derivatives. The increase in cost per gallon of propane was due to higher commodity prices. 
  
    59 

     Table of Contents  

Other Products Sales.   The decrease in the volume of other products sold was primarily due to reductions in production volumes as a result of low crude oil prices.  
    
  Our cost of sales of other products was increased by $2.7 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and reduced by $0.7 million of net realized gains on derivatives during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . Our cost of sales of other products during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was reduced by $3.3 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and increased by $0.2 million of net realized losses on derivatives. 
    
  Product margins during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   benefited from a high level of butane supply in the market, which lowered our product cost.  
    
  Other Revenues.   This revenue includes storage, terminaling and transportation services income. Other revenues decreased due to transportation services. While railcar costs have held steady, the value we can get for the railcar in the market has dropped significantly year over year. Our results were also negatively impacted by increased storage capacity. 
    
  Operating and General and Administrative Expenses.   The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in incentive compensation associated with lower product sales. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense.   The     increase was due primar  ily to purchase accounting adjustments for the Sawtooth cavern acquisition during the     three months ended September 30, 2015  .

Table of Contents  

Retail Propane 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Retail Propane segment for the periods indicated: 

Revenues  . Propane revenues and volumes increased slightly due to acquisitions of retail propane businesses, offset by lower sales prices.  
    
  Distillates revenues and volumes decreased as the market is still suffering from the oversupply due to warmer weather in the prior winter. 
    
  Cost of Sales.   The increase in propane cost is due to increasing propane commodity prices. The distillates cost was due to an increase in commodity prices. 
    
  Operating and General and Administrative Expenses  . The increase was due primarily to increased compensation expense from acquisitions of retail propane businesses. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  . The increase was due primarily to acquisitions of retail propane businesses.

Refined Products     and Renewables 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Refined Products and Renewables segment for the periods indicated.     As previously reported, on February 1, 2016, we sold our general partner interest in TLP.     As a result, on February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP and began to account for our limited partner investment in TLP using the equity method of accounting.   Also, on April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned. 

(1) 
    Revenues include     $0.1 million     and     $0.3 million     of intersegment sales during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  ,   respectively, that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
       
  Refined Products Sales and Cost of Sales.     The     increase     in revenues and cost of sales was due primarily to     increased     volumes, partially offset by a     decrease     in refined products prices.     The     increased     volumes were due primarily to an increase in pipeline capacity allocations purchased during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   an expansion of our refined products operations, and the continued demand for motor fuels in the current low gasoline price environment.     Product margin during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016     was also impacted by storage fees paid to TLP which are no longer eliminated as TLP was deconsolidated on February 1, 2016. 

62 

     Table of Contents  

Renewables Sales.     The     increase     in revenues was due primarily to     increased     volumes, partially offset by a     decrease     in renewables prices.     The     increased     volumes were due primarily to being able to liquidate storage volumes as the renewables markets shifted from being in contango (a condition in which forward renewables prices are greater than spot prices) to being backwardated (a condition in which forward renewables prices are lower than spot prices) during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Service Fee Revenues, Operating Expenses, General and Administrative Expenses, Depreciation and Amortization Expense.     The decrease in each of these line items was due primarily to the inclusion of TLP for the     three months ended     September 30, 2015     with no comparable activity in the current period, as TLP was deconsolidated on February 1, 2016. 
    
  (Gain) Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net  .   During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $7.6 million   of the deferred gain from the sale of the general partner in interest in TLP in February 2016.   See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion. 

Corporate and Other 
    
  The operating loss within  Corporate and Other  includes the following components for the periods indicated: 

General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   benefited from the reversal of incentive compensation. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded additional compensation expense and increased equity based compensation due to the grant of additional service and performance awards. 

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities 
    
  The     decrease     of     $2.4 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     was due primarily to a decrease of   $2.5 million   of earnings from TLP     (including   Battleground Oil Specialty Terminal Company LLC (   BOSTCO   )   and   Frontera Brownsville LLC (   Frontera   ))   that we acquired as part of our July 2014 acquisition of TransMontaigne   Inc. ( TransMontaigne ).   On February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP when we sold our general partner interest in TLP, and on April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned. 

Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense includes interest expense on our revolving credit facilities and senior notes, amortization of debt issuance costs, letter of credit fees, interest on equipment financing notes, and accretion of interest on noninterest bearing debt obligations.   The     increase     of     $1.9 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     was due primarily to the increased level of debt outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) (the average balance outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility was     $1.9 billion     during the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   compared to     $1.6 billion     during the     three months ended     September 30, 2015  ),   primarily to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by lower interest expense related to TLP s credit facility (our interest in TLP was acquired in July 2014, and we deconsolidated  
  
    63

TLP as of February 1, 2016) and lower interest expense as we repurchased a portion of the 2019 Notes (as defined herein) and 2021 Notes (as defined herein) during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the three months ended June 30, 2016. 

Gain on Early Extinguishment of Liabilities 
    
  During the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we acquired certain parcels of land on which one of our water solutions facilities is located and recorded a gain of     $0.9 million     on the release of certain contingent consideration liabilities. 

Other Income, Net 
    
  The following table summarizes the components of     other income, net     for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Relates primarily to     a loan receivable associated with our financing of the construction of a natural gas liquids facility to be utilized by a third party     and to loan receivables from equity method investees.     On June 3, 2016, we acquired the remaining     65%     ownership interest in     an equity method investee and all interest income on that receivable has been eliminated in consolidation subsequent to that date. 
              (2) 
    Represents another party s share of the profits generated from a joint crude oil marketing arrangement. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
    
  We qualify as a partnership for income tax purposes. As such, we generally do not pay United States federal income tax. Rather, each owner reports his or her share of our income or loss on his or her individual tax return. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined, as we do not have access to information regarding each partner s basis in the Partnership. 
    
  We have certain taxable corporate subsidiaries in the United States and in Canada, and our operations in Texas are subject to a state franchise tax that is calculated based on revenues net of cost of sales. Our fiscal years 2013 to 2016 generally remain subject to examination by federal, state, and Canadian tax authorities. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in tax rates are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
    
  Income tax expense   was   $0.5 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to an income tax benefit of   $2.8 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .   Income tax benefit during the     three months ended     September 30, 2015     included a benefit of $3.6 million related to a change in estimate of the income tax obligation payable related to TransMontaigne. 

Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  We have certain consolidated subsidiaries in which outside parties own interests.     The noncontrolling interest shown in our condensed consolidated financial statements represents the other owners  interests in these entities. 
    
  The     decrease     of     $3.6 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     was due primarily to the deconsolidation of TLP on February 1, 2016 as a result of the sale of our general partner interest in TLP  .

Segment Operating Results for the     Six Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Crude Oil Logistics 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Crude Oil Logistics segment for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Revenues include     $2.9 million     and     $6.2 million     of intersegment sales during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  ,   respectively, that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
       
  Crude Oil Sales.     The     decrease     in revenue per barrel was due primarily to the sharp decline in crude oil prices since July 2014.     The     decrease     in our sales volumes was due primarily to increased competition due to the continued crude oil production decline.     In addition, we also had an increase in buy/sell transactions during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   compared to the     six months ended     September 30, 2015  .   These are transactions in which we transact to purchase product from a counterparty and sell the same volumes of product to the same counterparty at a different location or time. As the revenues and costs of sales are netted for these transaction, so are the volumes. 
    
  Crude Oil Transportation and Other Revenues.     The     decrease     was due primarily to the flattening of the contango curve for crude oil (a condition in which forward crude oil prices are greater than spot prices) during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016     , compared to the     six months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   and lower revenues in our trucking and barge operations during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016     due to a general slowdown in demand for transportation services, compared to the     six months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Cost of Sales.     Our cost of sales during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016     was     increased   by   $5.5 million   of   net realized losses   on derivatives and   $0.2 million   of   net unrealized losses   on derivatives.   Our cost of sales during the     six months ended     September 30, 2015   was reduced by $2.1 million of net realized gains on derivatives and increased by $0.7 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives.   During the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   our cost of sales also decreased due to the decline in crude oil prices and the decrease in volumes due to increased competition.    
    
  Operating and General and Administrative Expenses  .     The     decrease     was due primarily to lower compensation expense related to a reduction in the number of employees as a result of organizational changes and lower repair and maintenance expense due to having a newer fleet of barges and the timing of repairs.  
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense.     The     decrease     was due primarily to certain intangible assets being fully amortized during the fiscal     year ended March 31, 2016  . 
  
    65 

     Table of Contents  

Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net  . During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded a loss of   $6.3 million   on the sales of certain assets and a loss of   $3.7 million   due to the write-down of certain other assets. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded a loss of   $1.0 million   on the sales of certain assets. 

Water Solutions 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Water Solutions segment for the periods indicated: 

The following tables summarize activity separated between the following categories: 

facilities we owned before   March 31, 2015,   which we refer to below as  existing facilities  and 
                
    facilities we acquired or developed after   March 31, 2015,   which we refer to below as  recently acquired or developed facilities . 
       
  Service Fee Revenues.     The following table summarizes our service fee revenues (in thousands, except per barrel amounts) for the periods indicated: 

66 

     Table of Contents  

The     decrease     in the volume processed at our existing facilities was due primarily to a slowdown in customer production as a result of the lower crude oil prices, as well as migration of volumes from existing facilities to recently developed or acquired facilities due to the location of the new facilities. 
    
  Recovered Hydrocarbon Revenues.     The following table summarizes our recovered hydrocarbon revenues (in thousands, except per barrel amounts) for the periods indicated: 

The     decrease     in revenue per barrel associated with recovered hydrocarbons was due primarily to the sharp decline in crude oil prices since July 2014 and     a decrease     in the amount of hydrocarbons per barrel of water processed. 
    
  Other Revenues.     The     increase     was due primarily to   an   increase     in revenues in the freshwater and water pipeline businesses. 
    
  Cost of Sales-Derivatives  .     We enter into derivatives in our Water Solutions segment to protect against the risk of a decline in the market price of the hydrocarbons we expected to recover when processing the wastewater.     Our cost of sales during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016     included     $3.5 million   of   net realized losses   on derivatives and   $0.8 million   of   net unrealized gains   on derivatives.   Our cost of sales during the     six months ended     September 30, 2015     included   $2.5 million of net realized gains on derivatives and $2.5 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives. 
    
  Cost of Sales-Other  .     The     increase     was due to trucking expenses to bring wastewater to our water solutions facilities. 
    
  Operating Expenses  .     The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands, except per barrel amounts) for the periods indicated: 

The     decrease     in operating expenses for existing facilities was due primarily to     lower     operating costs of water disposal wells at existing facilities due to     lower     volumes processed and cost reduction efforts. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  .     Of the     increase  , $5.2 million   related to recently acquired or developed water treatment and disposal facilities and   $1.3 million   related to recently developed solids processing facilities. 
    
  (Gain) Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net  . During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded the reversal of   $124.7 million   of the previously recorded   $380.2 million   goodwill impairment charge recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 (see   Note 6   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report).   During the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we wrote-off     $5.2 million     related to the value of an indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset in conjunction with finalizing our goodwill impairment analysis   (see   Note 7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report). During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we recorded a loss   of   $22.7 million   related to the termination of the development agreement,   which included the carrying value of the development agreement asset that was written off (see     Note 15   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included

     Table of Contents  

in this Quarterly Report).   During the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we recorded an impairment of     $1.7 million     related to   a   loan receivable   from an equity method investee. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded a loss of   $0.8 million   on the sales of certain assets. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded a loss of   $0.7 million   on the sales of certain assets. 
    
  Revaluation of Liabilities.     The revaluation of liabilities represents the valuation adjustment of contingent consideration liabilities related to royalty agreements acquired as part of certain business combinations during the     six months ended     September 30, 2015  .   During the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we did not identify any significant changes in our Water Solutions operations, which would require a revaluation of the contingent consideration obligation, and as such, no adjustment was recorded. 

Liquids 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Liquids segment for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Revenues include   $23.4 million   and   $24.3 million   of intersegment sales during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Propane Sales.   The decrease in volumes was due to significantly warmer temperatures in the prior year winter for which suppliers had full storage capacity and their ordering has been slow to pick up and also due to lack of opportunity in the spot market. 
    
  Our cost of wholesale propane sales was reduced by $1.0 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and $0.5 million of net realized gains on derivatives during   six months ended September 30, 2016  . During the   six months ended September 30, 2015  , our cost of wholesale propane sales was increased by $0.9 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and reduced by $0.1 million of net realized gains on derivatives. The cost of propane remained relatively flat as there was an insignificant increase in commodity prices year over year. The reduction in cost of sales is due primarily to the decrease in volumes. 
    
  Product margins per gallon of propane sold were higher during the   six months ended September 30, 2016   than during the   six months ended September 30, 2015  . Product margins have improved because depressed market prices through last winter have led to lower inventory values to start out the new supply year. Propane prices declined during the   six months ended September 30, 2015  , which had an adverse impact on product margins.  
    
  Other Products Sales.   The decrease in the volume of other products sold was primarily due to reductions in production volumes as a result of low crude oil prices. 
    
  Our cost of sales of other products was increased by $4.7 million of net unrealized losses on derivatives and reduced by $1.2 million of net realized gains on derivatives during the   six months ended September 30, 2016  . Our cost of sales of other products during the   six months ended September 30, 2015   was reduced by $1.6 million of net unrealized gains on derivatives and increased by $0.6 million of net realized losses on derivatives. 
    
  Product margins during the   six months ended September 30, 2015   benefited from a high level of butane supply in the market, which lowered our product cost. 
    
  Other Revenues.   This revenue includes storage, terminaling and transportation services income. Other revenues decreased due to transportation services and increased storage capacity. While railcar costs have held steady, the value we are able to realize for the railcar in the market has dropped significantly year over year. 
    
  Operating and General and Administrative Expenses.   The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in overall compensation expense due to lower incentive compensation as well as continued cost management monitoring which focuses on reductions of expenses. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense.   The increase was due primarily to purchase accounting adjustments for the Sawtooth cavern acquisition during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

Retail Propane 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Retail Propane segment for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Revenues include   less than $0.1 million   of intersegment sales during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
       
  Revenues  . The decrease in both propane and distillate revenues was due to lower prices per gallon due to an oversupply in the propane market, which lowered commodity prices, as well as the significantly warmer temperatures during the winter in the prior year. Propane volumes increased slightly due to acquisitions of retail propane businesses. 
    
  Cost of Sales.   The decrease for both propane and distillates was due to lower commodity prices. 
    
  Operating and General and Administrative Expenses  . The increase was due primarily to increased compensation expense from acquisitions of retail propane businesses. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  . The increase was due primarily to acquisitions of retail propane businesses.

Refined Products     and Renewables 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of our Refined Products and Renewables segment for the periods indicated.     As previously reported, on February 1, 2016, we sold our general partner interest in TLP.     As a result, on February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP and began to account for our limited partner investment in TLP using the equity method of accounting.   Also, on April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned. 

(1) 
    Revenues include     $0.1 million     and     $0.5 million     of intersegment sales during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016     and     2015  ,   respectively, that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
       
  Refined Products Sales and Cost of Sales.     The     increase     in revenues and cost of sales was due primarily to     increased     volumes, partially offset by a     decrease     in refined products prices.     The     increased     volumes were due primarily to an increase in pipeline capacity allocations purchased during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   an expansion of our refined products operations, and the continued demand for motor fuels in the current low gasoline price environment.     Product margin during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016     was also impacted by storage fees paid to TLP which are no longer eliminated as TLP was deconsolidated on February 1, 2016. 

71 

     Table of Contents  

Renewables Sales.     The     increase     in revenues was due primarily to     increased     volumes, partially offset by a     decrease     in renewables prices.     The     increased     volumes were due primarily to being able to liquidate storage volumes as the renewables markets shifted from being in contango (a condition in which forward renewables prices are greater than spot prices) to being backwardated (a condition in which forward renewables prices are lower than spot prices) during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Service Fee Revenues, Operating Expenses, General and Administrative Expenses, Depreciation and Amortization Expense.     The decrease in each of these line items was due primarily to the inclusion of TLP for the     six months ended     September 30, 2015     with no comparable activity in the current period, as TLP was deconsolidated on February 1, 2016. 
    
  (Gain) Loss on Disposal or Impairment of Assets, Net  .   During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized a   $104.1 million   gain from the sale of all of the TLP units we owned. During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $15.1 million   of the deferred gain from the sale of the general partner in interest in TLP in February 2016.   See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion. 

Corporate and Other 
    
  The operating loss within  Corporate and Other  includes the following components for the periods indicated: 

General and Administrative Expenses.   The decrease was due primarily to lower equity based compensation expense. For our performance units, we recorded expense of $3.1 million during the   six months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to $18.1 million during the   six months ended September 30, 2015  . The   six months ended September 30, 2015   included the initial grant and vesting of the first tranche of the performance units. The expense associated with the service award units (exclusive of accruals of annual bonuses paid or expected to be paid in common units) was $27.7 million during the   six months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to $23.4 million during the   six months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to the grant of additional awards. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion of our equity based compensation awards. 

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities    
    
  The     decrease     of     $10.7 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016     was due primarily to a decrease of   $8.3 million   of earnings from TLP     (including     BOSTCO     and     Frontera  )   that we acquired as part of our July 2014 acquisition of TransMontaigne  .   On February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP when we sold our general partner interest in TLP, and on April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned.   Also contributing to this   decrease   was a decrease of $2.3 million in earnings from our investments in Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC. 

Revaluation of Investments 
    
  On June 3, 2016, we acquired the remaining     65%     ownership interest in   a water supply company.   Prior to the completion of this transaction, we accounted for our previously held     35%   ownership interest   of this water supply company  
  
    72 

     Table of Contents  

using the equity method of accounting   (see   Note 2   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report).   As we now own a controlling interest in this entity, we revalued our previously held     35%     ownership interest to fair value     and recorded a loss of     $14.9 million  .   As the amount paid (cash plus the fair value of our previously held ownership interest) was less than the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of     $0.6 million  . 

Interest Expense 
    
  The     increase     of     $1.5 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016     was due primarily to the increased level of debt outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) (the average balance outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility was     $1.9 billion     during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   compared to     $1.6 billion     during the     six months ended     September 30, 2015  ),   primarily to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by lower interest expense related to TLP s credit facility (our interest in TLP was acquired in July 2014, and we deconsolidated TLP as of February 1, 2016) and lower interest expense as we repurchased a portion of the 2019 Notes (as defined herein) and 2021 Notes (as defined herein) during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the three months ended June 30, 2016. 

Gain on Early Extinguishment of Liabilities 
    
  During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   $5.0 million   of our 2019 Notes (as defined herein) and   $19.2 million   of our 2021 Notes (as defined herein) for an aggregate purchase price of   $15.1 million   (excluding payments of accrued interest). As a result, we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of these notes of   $8.6 million   (net of the write off of debt issuance costs of   $0.5 million  ). 
    
  As discussed in   Note 15   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, we accounted for the termination of the development agreement as an acquisition of assets (see   Note 7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a further discussion) and recorded a gain of   $21.3 million   on the release of   $46.8 million   of contingent consideration liabilities. 
    
  During the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we acquired certain parcels of land on which one of our water solutions facilities is located and recorded a gain of     $0.9 million     on the release of certain contingent consideration liabilities. 

Other Income, Net 
    
  The following table summarizes the components of     other income, net     for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    Relates primarily to     a loan receivable associated with our financing of the construction of a natural gas liquids facility to be utilized by a third party     and to loan receivables from equity method investees.     On June 3, 2016, we acquired the remaining     65%     ownership interest in     an equity method investee and all interest income on that receivable has been eliminated in consolidation subsequent to that date. 
              (2) 
    Represents another party s share of the profits generated from a joint crude oil marketing arrangement. 
              (3) 
    During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we received a distribution from TLP of $2.9 million pursuant to the agreement to sell all of the TLP common units we owned in April 2016. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
    
  We qualify as a partnership for income tax purposes. As such, we generally do not pay United States federal income tax. Rather, each owner reports his or her share of our income or loss on his or her individual tax return. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined, as we do not have access to information regarding each partner s basis in the Partnership.

     Table of Contents  

We have certain taxable corporate subsidiaries in the United States and in Canada, and our operations in Texas are subject to a state franchise tax that is calculated based on revenues net of cost of sales. Our fiscal years 2013 to 2016 generally remain subject to examination by federal, state, and Canadian tax authorities. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in tax rates are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
    
  Income tax expense   was   $0.9 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to an income tax benefit of   $2.2 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2015  .   Income tax benefit during the     six months ended     September 30, 2015     included a benefit of $3.6 million related to a change in estimate of the income tax obligation payable related to TransMontaigne. 

Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  The     decrease     of     $2.1 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016     was due primarily to the deconsolidation of TLP on February 1, 2016 as a result of the sale of our general partner interest in TLP  , partially offset by adjustments related to noncontrolling interests. 

Liquidity, Sources of Capital and Capital Resource Activities 
    
  Our principal sources of liquidity and capital are the cash flows from our operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. See   Note 8   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a detailed description of our long-term debt. Our cash flows from operations are discussed below. 
    
  Our borrowing needs vary during the year due in part to the seasonal nature of our liquids business. Our greatest working capital borrowing needs generally occur during the period of June through December, when we are building our natural gas liquids inventories in anticipation of the heating season. Our working capital borrowing needs generally decline during the period of January through March, when the cash flows from our Retail Propane and Liquids segments are the greatest. 
    
  Our partnership agreement requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement) to unitholders as of the record date. Available cash for any quarter generally consists of all cash on hand at the end of that quarter, less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner, to (i) provide for the proper conduct of our business, (ii) comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, and (iii) provide funds for distributions to our unitholders and to our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters. 
    
  We believe that our anticipated cash flows from operations and the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. If our plans or assumptions change or are inaccurate, or if we make acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital or sell assets. Our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, depends on various factors and conditions, including market conditions. We cannot give any assurances that we can raise additional capital to meet these needs. Commitments or expenditures, if any, we may make toward any acquisition projects are at our discretion. 
    
  We have historically pursued a strategy of growth through acquisitions. Under current market conditions, the cost of capital is much higher than it has been in recent years; prospective lenders seek much higher interest rates than they have sought in the past, and at our prior distribution level of $0.64 per common unit, the yield on our common units was much higher than it had been in the past. In April 2016, the board of directors of our general partner decided to reduce our distribution level from $0.64 per common unit to $0.39 per common unit. At that time, we expected the reduction in the distribution to provide us with approximately $170 million of annual cash savings to enhance liquidity, repay indebtedness and/or invest in selected growth projects. 
    
  Under current market conditions, we are much less likely to pursue acquisitions than we have been in the past. We continue to undertake certain capital expansion projects, including our assets that will be connected to the Grand Mesa Pipeline and the continued development of Sawtooth natural gas liquids storage caverns, among others. We expect to be able to finance these projects through available capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility, asset sales or other forms of financing.

Other sources of liquidity during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   are discussed below. 
    
  Sale of TLP Common Units 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned to     ArcLight   Capital Partners   for approximately     $112.4 million     in cash and recorded a gain on disposal of     $104.1 million     during the     six months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Class A Convertible Preferred Units 
    
  During the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , we issued   $240 million   of   10.75%   Class A Convertible Preferred Units to Oaktree Capital Management L.P. and its co-investors. See   Note 11   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report which discusses the preferences, rights, powers and duties of holders of the Preferred Units. 
    
  At-The-Market Program 
    
  On August 24, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution program in connection with an   ATM Program   pursuant to which we may issue and sell common units for up to     $200.0 million     in gross proceeds.   We are under no obligation to issue equity under the ATM Program. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the ATM Program for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, capital expenditures and additions to working capital.   During the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we sold     524,000     common units for proceeds of     $9.6 million  ,   net of offering costs of     less than $0.1 million  .   In connection with the issuance of the common units, we issued     524     general partner units to our general partner and     less than $0.1 million     in order to maintain its     0.1%     general partner interest in us.    
    
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we sold an additional     192,000     common units for proceeds of     $3.7 million  , net of offering costs of     less than $0.1 million  . 

Long-Term Debt 
    
  Credit Agreement 
    
  We have entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement includes a revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs (the  Working Capital Facility ) and a revolving credit facility to fund acquisitions and expansion projects (the  Expansion Capital Facility,  and together with the Working Capital Facility, the  Revolving Credit Facility ). At   September 30, 2016  , our Revolving Credit Facility had a total capacity of   $2.484 billion  . Our Revolving Credit Facility has an  accordion  feature that allows us to increase the capacity by   $150 million   if new lenders wish to join the syndicate or if current lenders wish to increase their commitments. 
    
  The Expansion Capital Facility had a total capacity of   $1.446 billion   for cash borrowings at   September 30, 2016  .   At that date, we had outstanding borrowings of     $1.312 billion     on the Expansion Capital Facility.     The Working Capital Facility had a total capacity of     $1.038 billion     for cash borrowings and letters of credit at     September 30, 2016  .   At that date, we had outstanding borrowings of     $710.5 million     and outstanding letters of credit o  f   $75.3 million   on the Working Capital Facility.   Amounts outstanding for letters of credit are not recorded as long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, although they decrease our borrowing capacity under the Working Capital Facility. The capacity available under the Working Capital Facility may be limited by a  borrowing base  (as defined in the Credit Agreement), which is calculated based on the value of certain working capital items at any point in time. 
    
  The commitments under the Credit Agreement expire on November 5, 2018. We have the right to prepay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement without incurring any penalties, and prepayments of principal may be required if we enter into certain transactions to sell assets or obtain new borrowings. 
    
  All borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at either (i) an alternate base rate plus a margin of   0.50%     to     1.75%     per year or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of     1.50%     to     2.75%   per year. The applicable margin is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). At   September 30, 2016  ,   the borrowings under the Credit Agreement had an average interest rate     of     2.83%  ,   calculated as the LIBOR rate of     0.53%     plus a margin of     2.25%     for LIBOR borrowings and the prime rate of     3.50%     plus a margin of     1.25%     on alternate base rate borrowings.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   the interest rate in effect on letters of credit was     2.25%  .   Commitment fees are charged at a rate ranging from     0.38%     to     0.50%   on any unused capacity. 

75 

     Table of Contents  

The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement also specifies that our leverage ratio cannot be more than     4.75     to     1   and that our interest coverage ratio cannot be less than     2.75     to     1     at any quarter end.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   our leverage ratio was approximately     4.15     to     1     and our interest coverage ratio was approximately     4.60     to     1  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  2019 Notes 
    
  On July 9, 2014, we issued     $400.0 million     of     5.125%   Senior Notes Due 2019 (the  2019 Notes ).   During the     three months ended   June 30, 2016  , we repurchased     $5.0 million     of our 2019 Notes for an aggregate purchase price of     $3.1 million     (excluding payments of accrued interest). As a result, we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of our 2019 Notes of     $1.8 million     (net of the write off of debt issuance costs of     $0.1 million  ). 
    
  The 2019 Notes mature on July 15, 2019. Interest is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year. We have the right to redeem the 2019 Notes before the maturity date, although we would be required to pay a premium for early redemption. 
    
  At     September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the 2019 Notes. 
    
  2021 Notes 
    
  On October 16, 2013, we issued     $450.0 million     of     6.875%     Senior Notes Due 2021 (the  2021 Notes ).   During the     three months ended     June 30, 2016,     we repurchased     $19.2 million     of our 2021 Notes for an aggregate purchase price of     $12.0 million     (excluding payments of accrued interest). As a result, we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of our 2021 Notes of     $6.8 million     (net of the write off of debt issuance costs of     $0.4 million  ). 
    
  The 2021 Notes mature on October 15, 2021. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. We have the right to redeem the 2021 Notes before the maturity date, although we would be required to pay a premium for early redemption. 
    
  At     September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. 
    
  2022 Notes 
    
  On June 19, 2012, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (as amended, the  Note Purchase Agreement ) whereby we issued     $250.0 million     of Senior Notes in a private placement (the  2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of     6.65%  ,   which is payable quarterly. The 2022 Notes are required to be repaid in semi-annual installments of     $25.0 million     beginning on December 19, 2017 and ending on the maturity date of June 19, 2022.     We have the option to prepay outstanding principal, although we would incur a prepayment penalty.     On September 30, 2016, we amended our Note Purchase Agreement which, among other things, changes the maximum allowable leverage ratio to match the maximum allowable leverage ratio and the calculation of such ratio under our Credit Agreement. Additionally, the amendment provides for an increase in interest charged should our leverage ratio exceed certain predetermined levels.   The 2022 Notes are secured by substantially all of our assets and rank equal in priority with borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  At     September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with the covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement. 
    
  2023 Notes 
    
  As described in Note 16, we issued   $700.0 million   of senior unsecured notes during October 2016. These senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of   7.50%   and mature on November 1, 2023.

Cash Flows 
    
  The following table summarizes the sources (uses) of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Operating Activities.   The seasonality of our natural gas liquids businesses has a significant effect on our cash flows from operating activities. Increases in natural gas liquids prices typically reduce our operating cash flows due to higher cash  
  
    77 

     Table of Contents  

requirements to fund increases in inventories, and decreases in natural gas liquids prices typically increase our operating cash flows due to lower cash requirements to fund increases in inventories. 
    
  In general, our operating cash flows are at their lowest levels during our first and second fiscal quarters, or the six months ending September 30, when we experience operating losses or lower operating income as a result of lower volumes of natural gas liquids sales and when we are building our inventory levels for the upcoming heating season. Our operating cash flows are generally greatest during our third and fourth fiscal quarters, or the six months ending March 31, when our operating income levels are highest and customers pay for natural gas liquids consumed during the heating season months. We borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility to supplement our operating cash flows as necessary during our first and second fiscal quarters. 
    
  Investing Activities  . Net cash used in investing activities was   $235.5 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $340.9 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to: 

$112.4 million   in proceeds received from the sale of the TLP common units we owned during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  ; 
                  
    a   $13.9 million     decrease   related to a loan receivable from an equity method investee as we purchased the remaining ownership interest in this equity method investee and, therefore, consolidated this previous equity method investee in our condensed consolidated financial statements during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
       
  These   decrease  s were partially offset by: 

a   $68.0 million     increase   in cash flows from derivatives; 
                
    $42.0 million     to acquire certain refined product pipeline capacity allocations from other shippers on the Colonial pipeline   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  ; and 
                
    a   $16.9 million   payment to terminate the development agreement (see   Note 15   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report). 
       
  Financing Activities  . Net cash provided by financing activities was   $287.2 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $155.6 million   during the   six months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to: 

$235.0 million   in proceeds received (net of offering costs) from the sale of our Preferred Units and warrants during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  ; and 
                
    a   decrease   of   $86.1 million   in distributions paid to our partners and noncontrolling interest owners during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
       
  These   increase  s were partially offset by: 

a   $173.6 million     decrease   in borrowings on our revolving credit facilities (net of repayments) to fund our operating or investing requirements during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  ; 
                
    a   $25.9 million   release of contingent consideration liabilities related to the termination of the development agreement during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016   (see   Note 15   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report); and 
                
    $15.1 million   in repurchases of a portion of our outstanding senior notes during the   six months ended     September 30, 2016  .

(2) 
    We have executed noncancelable agreements with crude oil and refined products pipeline operators, which guarantee us minimum monthly shipping capacity on the pipelines. As a result, we are required to pay the minimum shipping fees if actual shipments are less than our allotted capacity. 
                 
    As part of the Grand Mesa Pipeline project, we will have some assets connected to the pipeline. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining costs for these assets are approximately   $15.2 million  . We expect these assets to be completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. 
                
    In February 2015, we acquired Sawtooth, which owns a natural gas liquids salt dome storage facility in Utah with rail and truck access to western United States markets and entered into a construction agreement to expand the storage capacity of the facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining costs for this project are   $3.1 million  . We expect this project to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.

Index prices are based on a forward price curve at   September 30, 2016  . A theoretical change of $0.10 per gallon in the underlying commodity price at   September 30, 2016   would result in a change of   $58.7 million   in the value of our index-price natural gas liquids purchase commitments. A theoretical change of $1.00 per barrel in the underlying commodity price at   September 30, 2016   would result in a change of   $14.5 million   in the value of our index-price crude oil purchase commitments. 
    
  Sales Contracts 
    
  We have entered into product sales contracts for which we expect the parties to physically settle the inventory in future periods. At   September 30, 2016  , we had the following sales contract volumes (in thousands): 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Environmental Legislation 
    
  See our Annual Report for a discussion of proposed environmental legislation and regulations that, if enacted, could result in increased compliance and operating costs. However, at this time we cannot predict the structure or outcome of any future legislation or regulations or the eventual cost we could incur in compliance.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us, see   Note 2   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the Partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management. We have identified certain accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The application of these accounting policies, which requires subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events, and changes in these accounting policies, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our Annual Report. 

Item 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  A significant portion of our long-term debt is variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates impact the interest payments of our variable-rate debt but generally do not impact the fair value of the liability. Conversely, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt but do not impact its cash flows. 
    
  Our Revolving Credit Facility is variable-rate debt with interest rates that are generally indexed to bank prime or LIBOR interest rates.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   we had     $2.0 billion     of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility at an average interest rate of     2.83%  . A change in interest rates of 0.125% would result in an increase or decrease of our annual interest expense of $2.5 million, based on borrowings outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 

Commodity Price and Credit Risk 
    
  Our operations are subject to certain business risks, including commodity price risk and credit risk.   Commodity price risk is the risk that the market value of crude oil, natural gas liquids, or refined products will change, either favorably or unfavorably, in response to changing market conditions.     Credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers, customers or financial counterparties to a contract. 
    
   Procedures and limits for managing commodity price risks and credit risks are specified in our market risk policy and credit risk policy, respectively.   Open commodity positions and market price changes are monitored daily and are reported to senior management and to marketing operations personnel.   Credit risk is monitored daily and exposure is minimized through customer deposits, restrictions on product liftings, letters of credit, and entering into master netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain transactions.     At     September 30, 2016  ,   our primary counterparties were retailers, resellers, energy marketers, producers, refiners, and dealers. 
    
  The crude oil, natural gas liquids, and refined products industries are  margin-based  and  cost-plus  businesses in which gross profits depend on the differential of sales prices over supply costs. We have no control over market conditions. As a result, our profitability may be impacted by sudden and significant changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and refined products. 
    
  We engage in various types of forward contracts and financial derivative transactions to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs, to protect the value of our inventory positions, and to help ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply. We attempt to balance our contractual portfolio by purchasing volumes when we have a matching purchase commitment from our wholesale and retail customers. We may experience net unbalanced positions from time to time. In addition to our ongoing policy to maintain a balanced position, for accounting purposes we are required, on an ongoing basis, to track and report the market value of our derivative portfolio. 
    
  Although we use financial derivative instruments to reduce the market price risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not account for financial derivative transactions as hedges. We record the changes in fair value of these financial derivative transactions within cost of sales. The following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on the

Fair Value 
    
  We use observable market values for determining the fair value of our derivative instruments. In cases where actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis. 

Item 4.            Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our filings and submissions under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  We completed an evaluation under the supervision and with participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures at   September 30, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner have concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide the reasonable assurance discussed above. 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II 

Item 1.        Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. For information related to legal proceedings, see the discussion under the captions    Legal Contingencies    and    Environmental Matters    in   Note 10   to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. 
    
  As previously disclosed, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) had informed NGL Crude Logistics, LLC, formerly known as Gavilon, LLC (hereafter referred to as  Gavilon ) of alleged violations in 2011 by Gavilon of the Clean Air Act s renewable fuel standards regulations (prior to its acquisition by NGL in December 2013). On October 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice, acting at the request of the EPA, filed a civil complaint in the Northern District of Iowa against Gavilon and one of its then suppliers, Western Dubuque Biodiesel LLC ( Western Dubuque ). Consistent with the earlier allegations by the EPA, the civil complaint relates to transactions between Gavilon and Western Dubuque and the generation of biodiesel renewable identification numbers ( RINs ) sold by Western Dubuque to Gavilon in 2011. The complaint seeks an order declaring that the RINs generated by Western Dubuque be declared invalid, that the defendants retire and replace such RINs and that the defendants pay statutory civil penalties. Consistent with our position against the previous EPA allegations, we deny the allegations in this civil complaint and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the civil action. However, at this time NGL is unable to determine the outcome of this action or its significance to us.

   1 

Trigger Event resulted solely as a result of a Test Two Failure, 0.50% (  i.e.  , a Test One Failure had occurred in a prior period and no Reset Event had occurred for such Test One Failure) and (III) if such Trigger Event exists as a result of both a Test One Failure and a Test Two Failure, 1.00%, (y) the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such holder or its predecessor holder as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter of the Company for which the Company is required to deliver financial statements pursuant to Sections 7.1 (a) or (b), as the case may be, and giving effect to any reduction in principal of the Notes since the end of such fiscal quarter, and (z) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from and including the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter described in the immediately preceding clause (y) to, but excluding the date of, the occurrence of the Trigger Event and the denominator of which is 360; 
    
  (b)    if, at any time following (I) a Trigger Event where a Test Two Failure existed, no Test Two Failure shall continue to exist or (II) a Trigger Event where a Test One Failure existed, no Test One Failure shall continue to exist (each a    Reset Event    provided, however, that such Reset Event shall be deemed to occur on the date upon which the Company delivers its quarterly or annual financial statements and accompanying certificates pursuant to Sections 7.1 and 7.2 demonstrating satisfaction of the aforementioned conditions), (i) the interest rate with respect to the Notes shall be immediately and automatically reduced by 0.50% (or, with respect to a Reset Event occurring as a result of the satisfaction of both clauses (I) and (II) above, 1.00%) per annum for the remaining life of the Notes (subject to the provisions of Sections 8.9(a) and (c)) and (ii) each holder of Notes shall apply a one-time credit, on the next Interest Payment Date of the Notes following such Reset Event, to the accrued interest owed by the Company with respect to the Notes by an amount equal to the product of (x)(A) if only one of the above clauses (I) and (II) caused the Reset Event, 0.50% or (B) if both of the above clauses (I) and (II) caused the Reset Event, 1.00%, (y) the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such holder or its predecessor holder as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter of the Company for which the Company is required to deliver financial statements pursuant to Section 7.1 (a) or (b), as the case may be, and giving effect to any reduction in principal of the Notes since the end of such fiscal quarter, and (z) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from and including the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter described in the immediately preceding clause (y) to, but excluding the date of, the occurrence of the Reset Event and the denominator of which is 360;  
    
  (c)    notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.9 to the contrary, another Trigger Event may follow a Reset Event, in which case the provisions of Sections 8.9(a) and (b) shall apply; and 
    
  (d)    for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.9 or otherwise in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the interest rate with respect to the Notes shall be at the default rate as set forth in clause (b) of the first paragraph of each Note, and such rate shall be automatically increased by the applicable rate specified in Section 8.9(a) for all periods during which a Trigger Event continues to exist.  
    
  (c)      Amendment to clause (a) of Section 10.6 (Financial Covenants) of the Existing Note Purchase Agreement  .  Clause (a) of Section 10.6 (Financial Covenants) of the Existing Note Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;       
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:       
       
           a.

           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and    
       
           d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and       
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):    
       
           a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and    
       
           b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
