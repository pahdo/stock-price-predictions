NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Organization  

InsPro Technologies Corporation (the  Company ,
 ITCC ,  we ,  us  or  our ) is a technology company that provides software applications
for use by insurance administrators in the insurance industry. Our business focuses primarily on our InsPro Enterprise TM 
software application, which was introduced in 2004. 

The Company offers InsPro Enterprise on both a licensed and
an Application Service Provider ( ASP ) basis. InsPro Enterprise is an insurance administration and marketing system
that supports group and individual business lines, and efficiently processes agent, direct market, worksite and web site generated
business. InsPro Technologies' clients include insurance carriers and third party administrators. The Company realizes revenue
from the sale of software licenses, application service provider fees, hosting fees, software maintenance fees and consulting and
implementation services. 

Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto and other pertinent information contained in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ). 

The consolidated financial statements of
the Company include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated. 

Use of estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in 2016 and 2015 include the allowance for doubtful accounts,
stock-based compensation, the useful lives and valuation of property and equipment, and deferred revenue. 

Cash and cash equivalents  

The Company considers all liquid debt instruments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

Accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectable accounts  

The Company has a policy of establishing an allowance for uncollectible
accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company periodically
reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other
factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged
to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has established, based on a review of its outstanding balances, an allowance for doubtful
accounts in the amounts of $0 and $140,946, respectively. 

Fair value of financial instruments  

The carrying amounts of financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and capital leases approximated fair
value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments and their
market interest rates. 

The Company follows Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), for
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be
applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. 

Property and equipment  

Property and equipment are carried at cost.
The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are
retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses
are included in income in the year of disposition. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 360,  Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  the Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed
assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable. 

Impairment of long-lived assets  

The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company
recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

Income taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions
of FASB ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Income Taxes  ( ASC 740-10 ), which requires, among other things, an
asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. 

The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740-10 related
to  Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions.  When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken
would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the
position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10,
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence,
management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of
appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that
meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent
likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax
positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities
upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the
Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits. 

The Company has adopted FASB ASC 740-10-25  Definition of
Settlement,  which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the
purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the
completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively
settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than
not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. As of September
30, 2016, the tax years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are still subject to audit. 

Income (loss) per common share  

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income (loss)
from continuing operations by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing the adjusted net income (loss) from operations for diluted earnings per share by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each
period. The effects of common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during 2016 and 2015 are excluded
from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per common share because it is anti-dilutive.

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

The Company's common stock equivalents include the following: 

Revenue recognition and deferred revenue  

Revenues for nine months ended September 30, 2016, include a
reduction in the amount of $1,299,963 for stock based fees paid to a client. See Note 6 - Stockholders  Deficit   Series
B Preferred Stock Warrants. 

The Company offers InsPro Enterprise TM  on both a
licensed and an ASP basis. An InsPro Enterprise software license entitles the purchaser a perpetual license to a copy of the InsPro
Enterprise software installed at a single client location or hosted by InsPro Technologies. Alternatively, ASP hosting service
enables a client to lease the InsPro Enterprise software, paying only for that capacity required to support their business. ASP
and hosting clients access InsPro Enterprise installed on clients  servers or on the Company s servers located at a
third party s site. 

The Company s software maintenance fees apply to both
licensed and ASP clients. Maintenance fees cover periodic updates to the application and the InsPro Enterprise help desk. 

The Company s consulting and implementation services
are generally associated with the implementation of InsPro Enterprise for either an ASP or licensed client, and cover such activity
as InsPro Enterprise installation, configuration, modification of InsPro Enterprise functionality, client insurance plan set-up,
client insurance document design and system documentation. 

The Company s revenue is generally recognized under FASB
ASC 985-605 ( ASC 985-605 ). For software arrangements involving multiple elements, which are license fees, professional
services, ASP services and maintenance services, the Company allocates revenue to each element based on the relative fair value
or the residual method, as applicable using vendor specific objective evidence to determine fair value, which is based on prices
charged when the element is sold separately. Software revenue accounted for under ASC 985-605 is recognized when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, the software is delivered in accordance with all terms and conditions of the customer contracts, the
fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. Revenue related to post-contract customer support ( PCS ),
including technical support and unspecified when-and-if available software upgrades, is recognized ratably over the PCS term. Under
ASC 985-605, if fair value does not exist for any undelivered element, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of (i) delivery
of such element or (ii) when fair value of the undelivered element is established, unless the undelivered element is a service,
in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element.

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

The Company recognizes revenue from software
license agreements when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the software has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable, and collectability is probable. The Company considers fees relating to arrangements with payment terms extending
beyond one year to not be fixed or determinable and revenue for these arrangements is recognized as payments become due from the
customer. In software arrangements that include more than one InsPro Enterprise TM  module, the Company allocates the
total arrangement fee among the modules based on the relative fair value of each of the modules. 

License revenue allocated to software products
generally is recognized upon delivery of the products or deferred and recognized in future periods to the extent that an arrangement
includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and for which fair values have not been established. Revenue allocated
to maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue allocated to training and other service elements
is recognized as the services are performed. 

Effective August 18, 2015, the Company entered into a 5 year
software and services reseller agreement (the  Reseller Agreement ) with an unaffiliated 3 rd  party (the
 Reseller ) whereby the Company granted the Reseller the exclusive right to market InsPro Enterprise to prospective
clients for their administration of long term care insurance products for an initial fee of $2,500,000 (the  Reseller Fee ).
Pursuant to the Reseller Agreement, the Reseller Fee is fully or partially refundable to the Reseller in the event that the Company
material breaches the Reseller Agreement or the Company becomes insolvent, goes into liquidation, seeks protection under bankruptcy,
or materially breaches the Reseller Agreement during the term of the Reseller Agreement (each a  Refund Event ). The
Reseller Fee was fully refundable if a Refund Event occurred before August 31, 2016. A Refund Event did not occur as of September
30, 2016, and as a result the Company recognized $500,000 of Reseller Fee as revenue in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016. The Company shall refund the following amounts to the Reseller if a Refund Event occurs between the following dates;
$2,000,000 between September 1, 2016 and August 31, 2017, $1,500,000 between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018, and $1,000,000
between September 1, 2018 and August 31, 2019. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has recorded the $2,000,000 Reseller Fee in
deferred revenue ($500,000 included in short term liabilities and $1,500,000 included in long term liabilities). 

The unearned portion of the Company s revenue, which is
revenue collected or billed but not yet recognized as earned, has been included in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability
for deferred revenue.

Concentrations of credit risk  

The Company maintains its cash and restricted cash in bank deposit
accounts, which exceed the federally insured limits as provided through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
At September 30, 2016, the Company had $2,791,900 of cash in United States bank deposits, of which $500,946 was federally insured
and $2,290,954 was not federally insured.

The following table lists the percentage of the Company s
revenue earned from the Company s clients representing 10% or more of the revenue earned in each of the periods listed below. 

Stock-based compensation  

The Company accounts for stock based compensation transactions
using a fair-value-based method and recognizes compensation cost for share-based payments to employees based on their grant-date
fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied. 

Non-employee stock based compensation  

The cost of stock based compensation awards issued to non-employees
for services are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services,
whichever is more readily determinable, based on their grant-date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the
recognition provisions are first applied. 

Registration rights agreements  

At September 30, 2016, the Company does not
believe that it will incur a penalty in connection with the Company s registration rights agreements. Accordingly, no liability
in respect thereof was recorded as of September 30, 2016. See Note 6 - Stockholders Deficit   Registration and Participation
Rights.

Recent accounting pronouncements  

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued
by FASB, which are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that
the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements upon adoption. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), that outlines a
comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date
of ASU 2014-09 to the beginning of 2018 for public companies, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the standard
as early as the original effective date of 2017. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective
basis whereby it would be applied to new contracts and existing contracts with remaining performance obligations as of the effective
date, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings at the effective date for those contracts.
We are currently evaluating the impacts of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial position, results from operations
and related disclosures, along with the implementation approach to be used. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ), that requires all leases with a term greater than 12 months to be recognized on
the balance sheet, while lease expenses would continue to be recognized in the statement of operations in a manner similar to current
accounting guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
Entities must adopt ASU 2016-02 on a modified retrospective basis whereby it would be applied at the beginning of the earliest
comparative year. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial
Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326).  For most financial assets, such as trade and other receivables, loans and
other instruments, this standard changes the current incurred loss model to a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which
generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The new standard is effective for the Company at the
beginning of fiscal year 2019. Entities are required to apply the provisions of the standard through a cumulative-effect adjustment
to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated
financial statements.

holder then pursuant to their basic subscription right, the holder had the option to choose to subscribe for a portion of any Subscription
Units that were not purchased by all other holders of Subscription Units through the exercise of their basic subscription rights.

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview   

The current operations of InsPro Technologies
Corporation (the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) consist of the operations of our
wholly owned subsidiary InsPro Technologies, LLC ( InsPro LLC ). 

InsPro Enterprise TM  is a comprehensive, web-based
insurance administration software application. InsPro Enterprise was introduced by Atiam Technologies, L.P. in 2004. InsPro Enterprise
clients include health insurance carriers and third party administrators. We market InsPro Enterprise as a licensed software application,
and we realize revenue from license fees, application service provider fees, software maintenance fees and professional services. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

Financial Reporting Release No. 60, which
was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ), encourages all companies to include a discussion
of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements
include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of the consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates - Management's Discussion
and Analysis is based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly,
actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in 2016 and 2015 include the warrant liability, allowance
for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, the useful lives and valuation of property and equipment, and deferred revenue.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The Company offers InsPro
Enterprise on a licensed and an application service provider ( ASP ) basis. An InsPro Enterprise software license entitles
the purchaser a perpetual license to a copy of the InsPro Enterprise installed at a single client location, which may be used to
drive a production and model office instance of the application. The ASP hosting service enables a client to lease the InsPro Enterprise,
paying only for that capacity required to support their business. ASP clients access an instance of InsPro Enterprise installed
on clients  servers or on the Company s servers located at a third party s site. 

Software maintenance fees
apply to both licensed and ASP clients. Maintenance fees cover periodic updates to the application and the InsPro Enterprise Help
Desk. 

Professional services
are generally associated with the implementation of InsPro Enterprise instance for either an ASP or licensed client, and cover
such activity as InsPro Enterprise installation, configuration, modification of InsPro Enterprise functionality, client insurance
plan set-up, client insurance document design and system documentation. 

The Company s revenue is generally
recognized under FASB ASC 985-605 ( ASC 985-605 ). For software arrangements involving multiple elements, we allocate
revenue to each element based on the relative fair value or the residual method, as applicable using vendor specific objective
evidence to determine fair value, which is based on prices charged when the element is sold separately. Software revenue accounted
for under ASC 985-605 is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the software is delivered in accordance
with all terms and conditions of the customer contracts, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. Revenue
related to post-contract customer support ( PCS ), including technical support and unspecified when-and-if available
software upgrades, is recognized ratably over the PCS term. Under ASC 985-605, if fair value does not exist for any undelivered
element, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of (i) delivery of such element or (ii) when fair value of the undelivered
element is established, unless the undelivered element is a service, in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed
once the service is the only undelivered element. 

We recognize revenues from software license
agreements when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the software has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
and collectability is probable. We consider fees relating to arrangements with payment terms extending beyond one year to not be
fixed or determinable and revenue for these arrangements is recognized as payments become due from the customer. In software arrangements
that include more than one InsPro Enterprise TM  module, we allocate the total arrangement fee among the modules based
on the relative fair value of each of the modules. 

License revenue allocated to software
products generally is recognized upon delivery of the products or deferred and recognized in future periods to the extent that
an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and for which fair values have not been established.
Revenue allocated to maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue allocated to training and
other service elements is recognized as the services are performed. 

The unearned portion of the Company s
revenue, which is revenue collected or billed but not yet recognized as earned, has been included in the consolidated balance sheet
as a liability for deferred revenue. 

We review the carrying value of property
and equipment and intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying
amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds
its fair market value. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

Revenues  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 ( Third
Quarter 2016 ) and for the three months ended September 30, 2015 ( Third Quarter 2015 ) our revenues include
the following: 

In Third Quarter 2016 our professional services revenue, gross decreased primarily as a result of lower implementation services
to the Company s largest client and lower implementation services to a client implemented in 2015. Implementation services
included assisting clients in setting up their insurance products in InsPro EnterpriseTM, providing modifications to InsPro Enterprise s
functionality to support the client s business, interfacing InsPro Enterprise with the client s other systems, automation
of client correspondence to their customers and data conversion from the client s existing systems to InsPro Enterprise.
Post implementation services include these same services to existing clients supporting their ongoing utilization of InsPro Enterprise.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our ASP revenue decreased primarily as a result of decreased fees from a client s implementation
of InsPro Enterprise in 2015, which included $180,000 of fees for services that were provided to the client prior to Third Quarter
2015 but earned in Third Quarter 2015, partially offset by increased fees from an existing client s increased utilization
of InsPro Enterprise. ASP hosting service enables a client to either lease InsPro Enterprise software, paying only for that capacity
required to support their business, or for a client to outsource the operation of their licensed InsPro Enterprise installation
to the Company. ASP hosting clients access InsPro Enterprise installed on clients  servers or on the Company s servers
located at a third party s site.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our maintenance revenue decreased as a result of a client that terminated its use of InsPro Enterprise
in the first half of 2016.   

In Third Quarter 2016 we earned $500,000 of reseller fee revenue. Effective August 18, 2015, the Company entered into a 5 year
software and services reseller agreement (the  Reseller Agreement ) with an unaffiliated 3 rd  party (the
 Reseller ) whereby the Company granted the Reseller the exclusive right to market InsPro Enterprise to prospective
clients for their administration of long term care insurance products for an initial fee of $2,500,000 (the  Reseller Fee ).
Pursuant to the Reseller Agreement, the Reseller Fee is fully or partially refundable to the Reseller in the event that the Company
material breaches the Reseller Agreement or the Company becomes insolvent, goes into liquidation, seeks protection under bankruptcy,
or materially breaches the Reseller Agreement during the term of the Reseller Agreement (each a  Refund Event ). The
Reseller Fee was fully refundable if a Refund Event occurred before August 31, 2016. A Refund Event did not occur as of September
30, 2016, and as a result the Company recognized $500,000 of Reseller Fee as revenue in Third Quarter 2016. The Company shall refund
the following amounts to the Reseller if a Refund Event occurs between the following dates; $2,000,000 between September 1, 2016
and August 31, 2017, $1,500,000 between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018, and $1,000,000 between September 1, 2018 and August
31, 2019.   

Other revenue consists of reimbursements of office and administrative expenses pertaining to various agreements with related
and unrelated parties.   

Cost of Revenues  

Our cost of revenues consisted of the following: 

In Third Quarter 2016 our salaries, employee benefits and related taxes component of cost of revenues decreased as compared
to Third Quarter 2015 primarily as a result of decreased employee staffing.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our professional fees component of cost of revenues decreased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 as a
result of decreased utilization of several outside consulting firms, which were assisting us with modifications to InsPro Enterprise s
functionality and new clients  implementations of InsPro Enterprise TM,  combined with decreased recruiting expenses.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our depreciation expense component of cost of revenues decreased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 as
a result of certain assets having been fully depreciated in accordance with the original depreciation schedule for such assets.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our rent, utilities, telephone and communications component of cost of revenues increased as compared
to Third Quarter 2015 primarily due to lower expenses pertaining to our Eddystone office.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our other cost of revenues component of cost of revenues increased as compared to Third Quarter 2015
primarily due to increased computer equipment and software costs. Other cost of revenues consisted of the cost of 3 rd 
party licensed software resold to clients, equipment sold to clients, computer processing incurred primarily to provide ASP hosting
services, hardware and software, travel and entertainment, and office expenses.

profit of $1,324,642 in Third Quarter 2016, as compared to a gross profit of $1,057,831 in Third Quarter 2015. The results from
operations in Third Quarter 2016 were favorably impacted by $500,000 of reseller fee revenue in Third Quarter 2016. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consisted of
the following: 

In Third Quarter 2016 our salaries, employee benefits and related taxes decreased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 primarily
due to lower equity based compensation partially offset by higher paid compensation to employees.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our advertising and other marketing expenses increased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 primarily as
a result of increased marketing activities.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our depreciation expense increased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 as a result of a greater percentage
allocated to selling, general and administrative expense and a lesser percentage of depreciation allocated to cost of revenues.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our rent, utilities, telephone and
communications expense increased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 as a result of a lesser percentage of expense allocated to
cost of revenues and a greater percentage allocated to selling, general and administrative expense. 

In Third Quarter 2016 our professional fees decreased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 primarily due to lower IT consulting
expenses and lower employee recruiting expenses.   

In Third Quarter 2016 our other general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to Third Quarter 2015 primarily due
to lower computer processing expense.   

Operating loss from continuing operations  

As a result of the aforementioned factors, we reported a gain
from continuing operations of $49,297 in Third Quarter 2016, as compared to a loss of $388,563 in Third Quarter 2015. 

Other income (expenses)  

Interest expense decreased in the Third Quarter 2016 as compared
to the in the Third Quarter 2015 primarily due to the Company s loans with The Co-Investment Fund II, L. P. ( Co-Investment ),
which were repaid subsequent to the Third Quarter 2015, and repayment of a loan from Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ), which
was repaid in the Third Quarter 2015. Interest expense is attributable to interest on the Company s loans with Co-Investment,
SVB, capital leases and note payable for premium financing on a portion of the Company s insurance coverages. 

Gain on discontinued operations  

Results from discontinued operations consisted of the following: 

Revenues and income from discontinued operations in the Third
Quarter 2016 decreased as compared to the Third Quarter 2015 due to the declines in our discontinued telesales call center produced
agency business. We reported a gain from discontinued operations of $0 per share in Third Quarter 2016 and Third Quarter 2015. 

On February 20, 2009, the Company entered into and completed
the sale of its agency business to eHealth Insurance Services, Inc. The Company earns renewal commissions from certain insurance
companies and a transition policy commission pursuant to a client transition agreement with eHealth Insurance Services, Inc. 

Net loss  

As a result of these factors discussed above, we reported net
income of $56,313, or $0.01 net income per share, in Third Quarter 2016, as compared to a net loss of $394,447, or $0.04 net loss
per share in Third Quarter 2015.

Revenues  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ( 2016 To
Date ) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 ( 2015 To Date ) our revenues include the following: 

In 2016 To Date our professional services revenue, gross increased as a result of higher billable implementation and post implementation
services. Implementation services included assisting clients in setting up their insurance products in InsPro Enterprise TM ,
providing modifications to InsPro Enterprise s functionality to support the client s business, interfacing InsPro Enterprise
with the client s other systems, automation of client correspondence to their customers and data conversion from the client s
existing systems to InsPro Enterprise. Post implementation services include these same services to existing clients supporting
their ongoing utilization of InsPro Enterprise.   

On April 4, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with an existing client, which among other things, included a provision
that the Company issue within 30 days to the client a warrant to purchase in aggregate a total of 2,000,000 shares of the Company s
Series B Preferred Stock, which is immediately exercisable (the  2016 Series B Warrants ). The 2016 Series B Warrants
have a three year term, a cashless exercise provision and an exercise price of $3.00 per share. On May 4, 2016 the Company issued
the 2016 Series B Warrant to the client. The fair value of the 2016 Series B Warrants was estimated on April 4, 2016, which was
the date of the agreement with the client, to be $1,299,963 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following
assumptions: expected volatility: 503%, risk-free interest rate: 0.38%, expected life in years: 3 based on the contract life of
the 2016 Series B Warrants, and assumed dividend yield: 0%.   

In 2016 To Date our ASP revenue increased primarily as a result of increased fees from an existing client s increased

for these assets.

percentage of cost allocated to selling, general and administrative expense and a lesser percentage allocated to cost of revenues
in 2016 as compared to 2015 and higher expenses pertaining to our Eddystone office.   

In 2016 To Date professional fees decreased as compared to 2015 To Date primarily due to royalty expense incurred to an outside
consulting firm in the 2015 To Date partially offset by higher legal costs in 2016 To Date incurred in connection with the Company s
rights offering in the first quarter of 2016.   

In 2016 To Date our other general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to 2015 To Date. The decrease is primarily

800 shares of Common Stock that expires on November 20, 2017 at an exercise price of $0.15 per share. Effective with the expiration
of the subscription rights, which occurred on March 14, 2016, holders of subscription rights exercised in aggregate 17 basic subscription
rights and 0 over subscription rights for a total 17 Subscription Units. The Company received $4,080 in gross proceeds as a result
of the exercise of Subscription Units. As a result of the exercise of 17 Subscription Units the Company issued effective on March
14, 2016 in aggregate 1,360 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase in aggregate 13,600 shares of Common Stock
that expires on November 20, 2017 at an exercise price of $0.15 per share (the  2016 Warrants ). Effective with the
expiration of the subscription rights all unexercised subscription rights expired.   

On June 24, 2015, the Company together with InsPro LLC and Atiam Technologies L. P., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, (collectively the  InsPro Parties ), advised SVB of their desire to terminate the Amended and Restated
Loan and Security Agreement, dated December 2, 2014 (the  Loan Agreement ), between the InsPro Parties and SVB. Prior
to June 24, 2015, the InsPro Parties paid off the amount borrowed under the Loan Agreement, and on June 24, 2015 the InsPro Parties
paid SVB an early termination fees of $52,500, and SVB released all security interests in the InsPro Parties  assets.   

On January 30, 2015, the Company and InsPro LLC (collectively, the  Borrowers ) issued a Secured Convertible Promissory
Note ( Note ) to Co-Investment, a holder of more than 5% of our common stock on an as converted basis, pursuant to
a Secured Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ). In connection with the Note
Purchase Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a Security Agreement (the  Security Agreement , and together with the
Note and the Note Purchase Agreement, the  Financing Agreements ). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Financing Agreements, Co-Investment provided a loan in the amount of $1,000,000 ( Loan ) to the Borrowers,
which is secured by all assets of the Company and InsPro LLC other than copyright applications, copyright registration, patents,
patent applications, trademarks, services markets and other intellectual property (collectively the  Collateral ).
Pursuant to the Note, interest in the amount of 8% per annum, calculated on a 365 or 366 day year, as the case may be, and the
principal amount of $1,000,000 and accrued interest will be paid on or before September 30, 2016. Co-Investment has the right to
convert principal and accrued interest into the equity securities of the Company in the event that the Company issues and sells
equity securities to investors on or before the repayment in full of the Note in an equity financing resulting in gross proceeds
to the Company of at least $1,000,000.   

On March 17, 2015, the Company received a loan from Edmond Walters, a current director of the Company, in the amount of $500,000
(the  Walters Loan ). The Walters Loan was a pre-payment by Mr. Walters in connection with any future issuance of equity
securities of the Company, and is convertible into equity securities of the Company in connection with any such future issuance
of equity securities as agreed to by the Company and Mr. Walters. The Walters Loan is refundable to Mr. Walters on demand, without
interest, if the Company does not consummate an equity financing within a time period to be determined by the Company and Mr. Walters.   

On March 27, 2015, the Borrowers issued a second Secured Convertible Promissory Note ( The Second Note ) in the
amount of $1,000,000 to Co-Investment pursuant to a second Secured Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement (the  Second
Note Purchase Agreement ). The terms of the Second Note are essentially identical to the terms of the Note and the terms
of the Second Note Purchase Agreement are essentially identical to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.   

On September 18, 2015, pursuant to a purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ), the Company agreed to sell
to certain investors 1,163,141 units (each, a  Unit ) at a per Unit purchase price equal to $3.00. Each Unit sold in
the Private Placement consisted of one share of Series B Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase ten shares of Common Stock at
an initial exercise price of $0.15 per share, subject to adjustment. In connection with the Purchase Agreement the Company:   

o   Issued to Co-Investment Units equal to the outstanding principal and accrued interest owed to Co-Investment under the Note
and the Second Note in the exchange for the termination of the Note and the Second Note.   

o   Issue to Mr. Walters Units equal to the amount owed to Mr. Waters under the Walters Loan in exchange for the termination of
the Walters Loan, and refund to Mr. Walters $2.00 that represent fractional shares not issued.   

Payments on notes payable pertain to repayment of the borrowed amount under the Loan Agreement with SVB in 2015 and notes payable,
which we entered into in order to finance two of the Company s corporate insurance premiums.   

InsPro LLC has entered into various capital lease obligations
to purchase equipment used for operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would
have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  . 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Under the supervision of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as
of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the results of such assessment, management has concluded that the our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report have been designed and are functioning effectively
to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or
person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

(b) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   

There have not been any changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.  

  OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.   Legal
Proceedings  

From time to time we are involved in various investigations,
claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business, none of which, in our opinion, are material to our business.
We cannot assume that we will prevail in any litigation. Regardless of the outcome, any litigation may require us to incur significant
litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of our attention.
