      NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS             

      (UNAUDITED)             

1.             Organization    

   Alexander s,
Inc. (NYSE: ALX) is a real estate investment trust ( REIT ), incorporated in Delaware, engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping its properties. All
references to  we,   us,   our,   Company  and  Alexander s  refer to
Alexander s, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are managed by, and our
properties are leased and developed by, Vornado Realty Trust ( Vornado ) (NYSE:
VNO).     

2.             Basis of
Presentation     

     The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited and include the
accounts of Alexander s and its consolidated subsidiaries.  All intercompany
amounts have been eliminated. In our opinion, all adjustments (which include
only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations and changes in cash flows have been made.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the     United States of America     ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted.  These condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
instructions to Form 10-Q of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.     

We
have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for
the full year.    

We
currently operate in one business segment.       

3.            
The Alexander Apartment Tower     

   The
Alexander apartment tower, located above our Rego Park II shopping center,
contains 312 units aggregating 255,000 square feet and is 97.4% leased as of
September 30, 2016.     

4.             Recently Issued
Accounting Literature    

     In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an update ( ASU 2014-09 )
establishing Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 606    Revenue
from Contracts with Customers    ( ASC 606 ). ASU 2014-09 establishes a single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from
contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition
guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it
transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures.  In
August 2015, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2015-14 ) to ASC 606,    Deferral
of the Effective       Date   , which defers the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to
interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December
15, 2017.  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-08 ) to ASC 606,
   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),    which
clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations
in the new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09.  In April
2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-10 ) to ASC 606,    Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing,    which clarifies guidance related to
identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance
contained in ASU 2014-19.  In May 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU
2016-12 ) to ASC 606,    Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,    which
amends certain aspects of the new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU
2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these ASUs
on our consolidated financial statements.

INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES             

      NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)             

      (UNAUDITED)             

4.             Recently
Issued Accounting Literature         - continued    

           In January 2016, the FASB
issued an update ( ASU 2016-01 )    Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities    to ASC Topic 825,    Financial Instruments   . 
ASU 2016-01 amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure
certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized
in net income.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial
statements.       

In February 2016, the FASB issued ( ASU 2016-02 )    Leases   ,
which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU 2016-02 requires
lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or
operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is
effectively a financed purchase.  Lessees are required to record a
right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater
than 12 months. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for
similar to existing guidance for operating leases. Lessees will recognize
expense based on the effective interest method for finance leases or on a
straight-line basis for operating leases. The new standard requires lessors to
account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to
existing guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated
financial statements.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-09 )    Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting    to ASC Topic 718,    Compensation Stock
Compensation    ( ASC 718 ). ASU 2016-09 amends several aspects of the
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.   

In August 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-15 )    Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts       and Cash Payments    to ASC Topic 230,    Statement
of Cash Flows   .  ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the classification
of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows to reduce
diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or debt
extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other
debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation
to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement
of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life
insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi)
distributions received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests
in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash
flows and application of the predominance principle.  ASU 2016-15 is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of
this update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements.       

5.             Related Party Transactions     

    Vornado    

As of
September 30, 2016, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock.  We

5.             Related Party Transactions
- continued    

       Leasing
Agreements           

   Vornado
also provides us with leasing services for a fee of 3% of rent for the first
ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the eleventh through the twentieth
year of a lease term, and 1% of rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth
year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by tenants.  In the event
third-party real estate brokers are used, the fees to Vornado increase by 1%
and Vornado is responsible for the fees to the third-party real estate
brokers.  Vornado is also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of our
assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales less than
$50,000,000 and 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of
$50,000,000 or more.       

Other Agreements      

   We
also have agreements with Building Maintenance Services, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Vornado, to supervise (i) cleaning, engineering and security
services at our 731 Lexington Avenue property and (ii) security services at our
Rego Park I and Rego Park II properties.     

The
following is a summary of fees to Vornado under the various agreements
discussed above.         

As of
September 30, 2016, the amounts due to Vornado were $92,000 for development fees;
$379,000 for management, property management, cleaning and security fees; and $426,000
for leasing fees. As of December 31, 2015, the amounts due to Vornado were
$5,795,000 for development fees; $283,000 for management, property management
and cleaning fees; and $2,473,000 for leasing fees.     In
March 2016, we paid Vornado a development fee of $5,784,000 related to The Alexander
apartment tower.    

Toys  R  Us ( Toys )    

As of
September 30, 2016, our affiliate, Vornado owned 32.5% of Toys.  Toys leases
approximately 47,000 square feet of retail space at our Rego Park II shopping
center.  Joseph Macnow, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, and Vornado s Executive Vice President - Finance and Chief
Administrative Officer and Wendy A. Silverstein, a member of our Board of
Directors, represent Vornado as members of Toys  Board of Directors. 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $1,990,000 of
revenue related to the space leased by Toys.     

      6.             Marketable
Securities    

   As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we owned 535,265 common shares of
The Macerich Company ( Macerich ) (NYSE: MAC). These shares have an economic
cost of $56.05 per share, or $30,000,000 in the aggregate.  As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of these shares was $43,287,000 and
$43,191,000, respectively, based on Macerich s closing share price of $80.87
per share and $80.69 per share, respectively.  These shares are included in
 marketable securities  on our consolidated balance sheets and are classified
as available-for-sale.    Available-for-sale
securities are presented at fair value and unrealized gains and losses
resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are included in  other
comprehensive income.

7.             Significant
Tenants    

Bloomberg
L.P. ( Bloomberg ) accounted for revenue of $78,567,000 and $70,702,000, representing
approximately 46% and 45% of our total revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  No other tenant accounted for more
than 10% of our total revenues.  If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or
if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it
would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In
order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg s
creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and
metrics from Bloomberg.  In addition, we access and evaluate financial
information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly
available data.   

In
October 2014, Bloomberg exercised its option to extend leases that were
scheduled to expire in December 2015 for a term of five years covering 192,000
square feet of office space at our 731 Lexington Avenue property.  In January
2016, we entered into a lease amendment with Bloomberg which extends the lease
term related to this space to be coterminous with the other 697,000 square feet
of office space leased by Bloomberg through February 2029, with a ten-year
extension option. In connection with the lease amendment, Bloomberg provided a
$200,000,000 letter of credit, which amount may be reduced in certain
circumstances.  We may draw on this letter of credit subject to certain terms
of the lease amendment, including an event of default by Bloomberg.  Upon
execution of the lease amendment in January 2016, we paid an $8,916,000 leasing
commission of which $7,200,000 was to a third party broker and $1,716,000 was
to Vornado.     

      8.             Stock-Based
Compensation    

We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718. Our 2016
Omnibus Stock Plan, which was adopted in May 2016 replacing the expiring 2006
Omnibus Stock Plan, provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock
options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units
( DSUs ) and performance shares, as defined, to the directors, officers and
employees of the Company and Vornado.   

In
May 2016, we granted each of the members of our Board of Directors 203 DSUs
with a grant date fair value of $56,250 per grant, or $450,000 in the
aggregate. The DSUs entitle the holders to receive shares of the Company s
common stock without the payment of any consideration. The DSUs vested
immediately and accordingly, were expensed on the date of grant, but the shares
of common stock underlying the DSUs are not deliverable to the grantee until
the grantee is no longer serving on the Company s Board of Directors. As of
September 30, 2016, there were 8,505 DSUs outstanding and 498,376 shares were
available for future grant under the 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan.     

9.             Mortgages Payable    

The
following is a summary of our outstanding mortgages payable as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015.

      (UNAUDITED)             

10.          Fair
Value Measurements    

   ASC 820,
   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    defines fair value and
establishes a framework for measuring fair value.  ASC 820 establishes a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to
measure fair value into three levels: Level 1   quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or
liabilities; Level 2   observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in
active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3   unobservable
inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority
to Level 3 inputs.   In determining
fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as
well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.        

Financial
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value    

Financial
assets measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consist of marketable securities,
which are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value
hierarchy, and an interest rate cap which fair value was insignificant, as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. There were no financial liabilities
measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       

Financial
Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value    

Financial
assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated
balance sheets include cash equivalents and mortgages payable.  Cash
equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their
short-term maturities.  The fair value of our mortgages payable is calculated
by discounting the future contractual cash flows of these instruments using
current risk-adjusted rates available to borrowers with similar credit ratings,
which are provided by a third-party specialist.  The fair value of cash
equivalents is classified as Level 1 and the fair values of mortgages payable
are classified as Level 2.    The
table below summarizes the carrying amounts and fair value of these financial
instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

and Contingencies    

     Insurance     

   We maintain general
liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per
property, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits
of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with
sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our
properties.

     Fifty Ninth Street Insurance
Company, LLC ( FNSIC ), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a
direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear,
biological, chemical and radiological ( NBCR ) acts, as defined by the Terrorism
Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which expires in December
2020.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7
billion per occurrence and in the aggregate.  Coverage for acts of
terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance
companies with no exposure to FNSIC.  For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible
for a $348,000 deductible and 16% of the balance of a covered loss, and the
Federal government is responsible for the remaining 84% of a covered loss. We
are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.   

We
continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs
of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage
will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  We are
responsible for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage,
which could be material.   

Our     mortgage
loans are non-recourse to us and contain customary covenants requiring us to
maintain insurance.  Although we believe that we have adequate insurance
coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an
equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  If lenders
insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely
affect our ability to finance our properties.   

     Rego Park I
Litigation     

   On June 24, 2014,
Sears Roebuck and Co. ( Sears ) filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York against Vornado and us (and certain of our subsidiaries) with
regard to space that Sears leases at our Rego Park I property alleging that the
defendants are liable for harm that Sears has suffered as a result of (a) water
intrusions into the premises, (b) two fires in February 2014 that caused
damages to those premises, and (c) alleged violations of the Americans with
Disabilities Act in the premises  parking garage.  Sears asserted various
causes of actions for damages and sought to compel compliance with landlord s
obligations to repair the premises and to provide security, and to compel us to
abate a nuisance that Sears claims was a cause of the water intrusions into its
premises.  In addition to injunctive relief, Sears sought, among other things,
damages of not less than $4 million and future damages it estimated would not
be less than $25 million. In March 2016, Sears withdrew its claim for future
damages leaving a remaining claim for property damages, which we estimate to be
approximately $650,000 based on information provided by Sears.  We intend to
defend the remaining claim vigorously.  The amount or range of reasonably possible
losses, if any, is not expected to be greater than $650,000.   

     Paramus     

         In 2001, we leased 30.3 acres of land located in
Paramus, New Jersey to IKEA Property, Inc. The lease has a purchase option in
2021 for $75,000,000. The property is encumbered by a $68,000,000 interest-only
mortgage loan with a fixed rate of 2.90%, which matures in October 2018.  The
annual triple-net rent is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of debt service
on the mortgage loan. If the purchase option is exercised, we will receive net
cash proceeds of approximately $7,000,000 and recognize a gain on sale of land
of approximately $60,000,000. If the purchase option is not exercised, the
triple-net rent for the last 20 years would include debt service sufficient to
fully amortize $68,000,000 over the remaining 20-year lease term.   

Letters of Credit     

   Approximately $2,074,000 of standby letters of credit were
outstanding as of September 30, 2016.     

Other     

   On
October 15, 2015, the New York City Department of Finance ( NYC DOF ) issued a
Notice of Determination to us assessing an additional $20,900,000 of transfer
taxes (including interest and penalties) in connection with the sale of Kings
Plaza Regional Shopping Center in November 2012.  We believe that the NYC DOF s
claim is without merit and intend to vigorously contest this assessment.  We
have determined that the likelihood of a loss related to this issue is not
probable and, after consultation with legal counsel, that the outcome of this
assessment is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.   

There are various
other legal actions against us in the ordinary course of business.  In our
opinion, the outcome of such matters in the aggregate will not have a material
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of    

   Alexander s, Inc.   

   Paramus, New Jersey   

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Alexander s, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016,
and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and changes
in equity and cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management.   

We conducted our reviews in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally
of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an
audit conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an
opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do
not express such an opinion.   

Based on our reviews, we are
not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such
consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   

We have previously audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Alexander s, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year
then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 16, 2016,
we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 is fairly stated, in all material
respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
derived.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

Certain
statements contained in this Quarterly Report constitute forward-looking
statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. 
They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Our future results,
financial condition, results of operations and business may differ materially
from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.  You can find many of
these statements by looking for words such as  approximates,   believes, 
 expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends,   plans,   would,   may  or
other similar expressions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q.  These
forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations and
beliefs and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties.  Many
of the factors that will determine these items are beyond our ability to
control or predict.  For a further discussion of factors that could materially
affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements, see  Item 1A - Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.  For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe
harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or the date of any document incorporated by
reference.  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this
section.  We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly, any revisions
to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
include a discussion of our consolidated financial statements for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full year.   

Critical
Accounting Policies            

A
summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and
 Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated
financial statements included therein.  There have been no significant changes
to these policies during 2016.

Overview    

Alexander s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) is a real estate investment trust
( REIT ), incorporated in Delaware, engaged in leasing, managing, developing
and redeveloping its properties.  All references to  we,   us,   our, 
 Company,  and  Alexander s , refer to Alexander s, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries.  We are managed by, and our properties are leased and developed
by, Vornado Realty Trust ( Vornado ) (NYSE: VNO).  We have seven properties in
the greater New York City metropolitan area.   

We compete with a large number of property owners and developers. 
Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the world, national
and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current
and prospective tenants and customers, the availability and cost of capital,
construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations,
legislation, population trends, zoning laws, and our ability to lease, sublease
or sell our properties, at profitable levels.  Our success is also subject to
our ability to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms as it comes due.   

Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 Financial Results Summary     

Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $21,036,000,
or $4.11 per diluted share, compared to $18,172,000, or $3.55 per diluted share
for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Funds from operations ( FFO ) for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $28,949,000, or $5.66 per diluted
share, compared to $26,140,000, or $5.11 per diluted share for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015.    

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Financial Results Summary     

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
$64,822,000, or $12.68 per diluted share, compared to $53,335,000, or $10.43
per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  FFO for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $90,198,000, or $17.64 per diluted
share, compared to $75,918,000, or $14.85 per diluted share for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. FFO for the nine months ended Septembet 30, 2016 included
income of $2,257,000, or $0.44 per diluted share, resulting from a tenant lease
termination at our Rego Park II property.   

Square
Footage, Occupancy and Leasing Activity     

   As
of September 30, 2016, our portfolio was comprised of seven properties aggregating
2,437,000 square feet. As of September 30, 2016, our office and retail
properties had an occupancy rate of 100.0% and The Alexander apartment tower
had an occupancy rate of 97.4%.   

Financing     

   In March 2016, we completed a two-year extension of the 100%
cash collateralized loan on Rego Park I.  The interest-only loan has a fixed
rate of 0.35%.   

Significant Tenants     

Bloomberg
L.P. ( Bloomberg ) accounted for revenue of $78,567,000 and $70,702,000,
representing approximately 46% and 45% of our total revenues for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  No other tenant
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.  If we were to lose
Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its
obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.  In order to assist us in our continuing
assessment of Bloomberg s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential
financial information and metrics from Bloomberg.  In addition, we access and
evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources,
as well as publicly available data.   

In
October 2014, Bloomberg exercised its option to extend leases that were
scheduled to expire in December 2015 for a term of five years covering 192,000
square feet of office space at our 731 Lexington Avenue property.  In January
2016, we entered into a lease amendment with Bloomberg which extends the lease
term related to this space to be coterminous with the other 697,000 square feet
of office space leased by Bloomberg through February 2029, with a ten-year
extension option.  In connection with the lease amendment, Bloomberg provided a
$200,000,000 letter of credit, which amount may be reduced in certain
circumstances.  We may draw on this letter of credit subject to certain terms
of the lease amendment, including an event of default by Bloomberg.  Upon
execution of the lease amendment in January 2016, we paid an $8,916,000 leasing
commission of which $7,200,000 was to a third party broker and $1,716,000 was
to Vornado.

Three Months Ended       September 30, 2016,
compared to September 30, 2015    

Property Rentals    

   Property
rentals were $37,598,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $34,599,000
in the prior year s quarter, an increase of $2,999,000. This increase is
primarily due to (i) rental income of $2,457,000 from The Alexander apartment
tower, which was placed in service in phases beginning July 2015 and (ii)
higher rental income of $842,000 from the January 2016 lease amendment with Bloomberg
at 731 Lexington Avenue; partially offset by (iii) lower straight-line rental
income of $254,000 related to a tenant lease termination at our Rego Park II
property in June 2016.   

Expense Reimbursements    

   Tenant
expense reimbursements were $19,522,000 in the quarter ended September 30,
2016, compared to $17,815,000 in the prior year s quarter, an increase of
$1,707,000. This increase is primarily due to (i) higher recoveries of real
estate taxes and operating expenses from Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue, as
a result of the January 2016 lease amendment, which converted 192,000 square
feet from a gross rent basis to a net rent basis and (ii) higher reimbursable
real estate taxes.   

Operating Expenses    

   Operating
expenses were $21,714,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $19,390,000
in the prior year s quarter, an increase of $2,324,000. This increase was primarily
due to (i) higher operating expenses of $833,000 related to The Alexander
apartment tower, which was placed in service in phases beginning July 2015,
(ii) higher reimbursable real estate taxes of $1,017,000 and (iii) a $237,000
reversal of bad debt expense during the prior year s quarter.   

Depreciation and
Amortization    

   Depreciation
and amortization was $8,045,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $8,092,000 in the prior year s quarter.   

General and
Administrative Expenses    

   General
and administrative expenses were $1,225,000 in the quarter ended September 30,
2016, compared to $1,091,000 in the prior year s quarter, an increase of
$134,000. This increase was primarily due to higher professional fees.   

Interest and Other
Income, net    

   Interest
and other income, net was $522,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $427,000 in the prior year s quarter, an increase of $95,000. This
increase was primarily due to higher average yields on our cash balances.   

Interest and Debt
Expense    

   Interest
and debt expense was $5,615,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $6,094,000 in the prior year s quarter, a decrease of $479,000. This
decrease was primarily due to a savings of $772,000 resulting from the
refinancing of the retail portion of 731 Lexington Avenue on August 5, 2015 at
LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.92% as of September 30, 2016); as compared to the 4.93%
fixed rate on the previous loan, partially
offset by lower capitalized interest as a result of completing the development
of The Alexander apartment tower.

rentals were $113,129,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $103,654,000 in the prior year s nine months, an increase of $9,475,000.
This increase is primarily due to (i) income of $2,257,000 resulting from a
tenant lease termination at our Rego Park II property, (ii) rental income of
$4,711,000 from The Alexander apartment tower, which was placed in service in
phases beginning July 2015 and (iii) higher rental income of $2,524,000 from
the January 2016 lease amendment with Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue.   

Expense Reimbursements    

   Tenant
expense reimbursements were $56,554,000 in the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $51,442,000 in the prior year s nine months, an increase of $5,112,000.
This increase is primarily due to (i) higher recoveries of real estate taxes
and operating expenses from Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue, as a result of
the January 2016 lease amendment, which converted 192,000 square feet from a
gross rent basis to a net rent basis and (ii) higher reimbursable real estate
taxes.   

Operating Expenses    

   Operating
expenses were $60,702,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $55,985,000 in the prior year s nine months, an increase of $4,717,000. This
increase was primarily due to (i) higher operating expenses of $2,834,000
related to The Alexander apartment tower, which was placed in service in phases
beginning July 2015, (ii) higher reimbursable real estate taxes of $2,431,000
and (iii) a $366,000 reversal of bad debt expense during the prior year;
partially offset by (iii) lower reimbursable operating expenses of $1,027,000.   

Depreciation and
Amortization    

   Depreciation
and amortization was $25,745,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $22,783,000 in the prior year s nine months, an increase of $2,962,000.
This increase was primarily due to (i) additional depreciation of $2,514,000
related to The Alexander apartment tower, which was placed in service in phases
beginning July 2015 and (ii) additional depreciation and amortization of tenant
improvements and deferred leasing costs of $1,077,000 related to a tenant lease
termination at our Rego Park II property in June 2016.   

General and
Administrative Expenses    

   General
and administrative expenses were $4,285,000 in the nine months ended September

2016, compared to $1,237,000 in the prior year s nine months, an increase of $1,151,000.
This increase was primarily due to income in connection with a settlement agreement
with a former bankrupt tenant at our Rego Park I property and a cost
reimbursement settlement with a retail tenant at our 731 Lexington Avenue
property.     

Interest and Debt
Expense    

   Interest
and debt expense was $16,476,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $19,963,000 in the prior year s nine months, a decrease of $3,487,000.
This decrease was primarily due to savings of $5,460,000 resulting from the
refinancing of the retail portion of 731 Lexington Avenue on August 5, 2015 at
LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.92% as of September 30, 2016); as compared to the 4.93%
fixed rate on the previous loan, partially offset by lower capitalized interest
as a result of completing the development of The Alexander apartment tower.   

Income Taxes    

   Income
tax expense was $41,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $6,000 in the prior year s nine months.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources    

Cash Flows    

Property
rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent on a number
of factors, including the occupancy level and rental rates of our properties,
as well as our tenants  ability to pay their rents.  Our properties provide us
with a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that enables us to pay our
operating expenses, interest expense, recurring capital expenditures and cash
dividends to stockholders.  Other sources of liquidity to fund cash
requirements include our existing cash, proceeds from financings, including
mortgage or construction loans secured by our properties and proceeds from
asset sales.  We anticipate that cash flows from continuing operations over the
next twelve months, together with existing cash balances, will be adequate to
fund our business operations, cash dividends to stockholders, debt amortization
and capital expenditures.    

Nine Months Ended

   Cash and cash equivalents were $264,147,000 as of September
30, 2016, compared to $259,349,000 as of December 31, 2015, an increase of
$4,798,000.  This increase resulted from (i) $81,898,000 of net cash provided
by operating activities, partially offset by (ii) $63,934,000 of net cash used
in financing activities and (iii) $13,166,000 of net cash used in investing
activities.   

Net cash provided by operating activities of $81,898,000
was comprised of net income of $64,822,000, adjustments for non-cash items of $29,710,000
and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $12,634,000. The
adjustments for non-cash items were comprised of (i) depreciation and
amortization (including amortization of debt issuance costs) of $27,666,000,
(ii) straight-lining of rental income of $1,594,000 and (iii) stock-based
compensation expense of $450,000.   

Net cash used in financing activities of $63,934,000 was
primarily comprised of dividends paid of $61,363,000.   

Net cash used in investing activities of $13,166,000 was
primarily comprised of construction in progress and real estate additions of
$13,441,000 primarily related to The Alexander apartment tower, including the payment
of a development fee to Vornado of $5,784,000.

Net cash provided by
operating activities of $72,258,000 was comprised of net income of $53,335,000,
adjustments for non-cash items of $24,049,000 and the net change in operating
assets and liabilities of $5,126,000.  The adjustments for non-cash items were
comprised of depreciation and amortization (including amortization of debt
issuance costs) of $24,725,000, stock-based compensation expense of $600,000,
partially offset by straight-lining of rental income of $1,276,000.   

Net cash used in investing
activities of $17,089,000 was primarily comprised of construction in progress

apartment tower) partially offset by proceeds of $24,998,000 from short-term
investments that matured during the second quarter of 2015.   

Net cash used in financing
activities of $30,118,000 was primarily comprised of (i) debt repayments of
$322,372,000  (primarily  due  to  the  repayment of the prior loan on the
retail  portion of 731 Lexington Avenue) and (ii) dividends paid of 
$53,675,000, partially offset by (iii) proceeds of $350,000,000 related to the
August 2015 refinancing of the retail portion of 731 Lexington Avenue.   

Commitments
and Contingencies     

Insurance     

   We
maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence
and per property, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage
with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of
terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on
each of our properties.   

Fifty
Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC ( FNSIC ), our wholly owned consolidated
subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism,
including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological ( NBCR ) acts, as
defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which
expires in December 2020.  Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts)
is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate.  Coverage for acts
of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance
companies with no exposure to FNSIC.  For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a
$348,000 deductible and 16% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal
government is responsible for the remaining 84% of a covered loss.  We are ultimately
responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.   

We
continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs
of coverage for acts of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage
will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  We are
responsible for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage,
which could be material.   

Our
mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and contain customary covenants requiring
us to maintain insurance.  Although we believe that we have adequate insurance
coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an
equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future.  If lenders
insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely
affect our ability to finance our properties.   

21          

Liquidity and Capital Resources   continued    

Rego Park I Litigation     

   On June 24, 2014,
Sears Roebuck and Co. ( Sears ) filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York against Vornado and us (and certain of our subsidiaries) with
regard to space that Sears leases at our Rego Park I property alleging that the
defendants are liable for harm that Sears has suffered as a result of (a) water
intrusions into the premises, (b) two fires in February 2014 that caused
damages to those premises, and (c) alleged violations of the Americans with
Disabilities Act in the premises  parking garage.  Sears asserted various
causes of actions for damages and sought to compel compliance with landlord s
obligations to repair the premises and to provide security, and to compel us to
abate a nuisance that Sears claims was a cause of the water intrusions into its
premises.  In addition to injunctive relief, Sears sought, among other things,
damages of not less than $4 million and future damages it estimated would not
be less than $25 million. In March 2016, Sears withdrew its claim for future
damages leaving a remaining claim for property damages, which we estimate to be
approximately $650,000 based on information provided by Sears.  We intend to
defend the remaining claim vigorously.  The amount or range of reasonably
possible losses, if any, is not expected to be greater than $650,000.   

     Paramus     

   In
2001, we leased 30.3 acres of land located in Paramus, New Jersey to IKEA
Property, Inc. The lease has a purchase option in 2021 for $75,000,000. The
property is encumbered by a $68,000,000 interest-only mortgage loan with a
fixed rate of 2.90%, which matures in October 2018.  The annual triple-net rent
is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of debt service on the mortgage loan. If
the purchase option is exercised, we will receive net cash proceeds of
approximately $7,000,000 and recognize a gain on sale of land of approximately
$60,000,000. If the purchase option is not exercised, the triple-net rent for
the last 20 years would include debt service sufficient to fully amortize
$68,000,000 over the remaining 20-year lease term.   

Letters of Credit     

   Approximately
$2,074,000 of standby letters of credit were outstanding as of September 30,
2016.     

Other     

        On October 15, 2015, the New York City Department of
Finance ( NYC DOF ) issued a Notice of Determination to us  assessing an
additional $20,900,000 of transfer taxes (including interest and penalties) in
connection with the sale of Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center in November
2012.  We believe that the NYC DOF s claim is without merit and intend to
vigorously contest this assessment.  We have determined that the likelihood of
a loss related to this issue is not probable and, after consultation with legal
counsel, that the outcome of this assessment is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   

There
are various other legal actions against us in the ordinary course of business. 
In our opinion, the outcome of such matters in the aggregate will not have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   

22          

Funds from Operations
( FFO )     

FFO
is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). NAREIT
defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales
of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation
and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash
items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated
subsidiaries.  FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors
and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between
periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation
and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs
and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over
time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions.  FFO does
not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily
indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be
considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash
flow as a liquidity measure.  FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures employed by other companies.  A reconciliation of our net income to
FFO is provided below.   

FFO for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015     

FFO
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $28,949,000, or $5.66 per
diluted share, compared to $26,140,000, or $5.11 per diluted share for the prior
year s quarter.   

FFO
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $90,198,000, or $17.64 per
diluted share, compared to $75,918,000, or $14.85 per diluted share for the
prior year s nine months.   

The
following table reconciles our net income to FFO:   

23          

Item 3.   Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

We
have exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, which are sensitive to many
factors that are beyond our control.  Our exposure to a change in interest
rates is summarized in the table below.   

As of
September 30, 2016 we have an interest rate cap with a notional amount of
$300,000,000 that caps LIBOR at a rate of 6.0%.   

Fair
Value of Debt     

The
fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated by discounting the future
contractual cash flows of these instruments using current risk-adjusted rates
available to borrowers with similar credit ratings, which are provided by a
third-party specialist.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $1,045,000,000 and $1,054,000,000,
respectively.  Our fair value estimates, which are made at the end of the
reporting period, may be different from the amounts that may ultimately be
realized upon the disposition of our financial instruments.   

Item
4.   Controls and Procedures    

(a) Disclosure
Controls and Procedures:  Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.   

(b)
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:  There have not been any changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter to
which this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.   

24          

PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.           Legal       Proceedings    

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising
in the ordinary course of business.  In our opinion, the outcome of such
matters in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.
