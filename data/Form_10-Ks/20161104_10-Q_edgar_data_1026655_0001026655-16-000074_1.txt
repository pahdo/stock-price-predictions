4. Property, Plant   Equipment  
    
  Property, plant and equipment consisted of the following for the periods specified: 

Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost, unless obtained through acquisition, then assets are recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The carrying amount of long-lived assets is evaluated annually to determine if an adjustment to the depreciation period or to the unamortized balance is warranted.  Amounts invested in capital additions in progress were $  1,516,000   and $  2,331,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company capitalized $  0   and $  2,000   of interest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , purchase commitments for capital expenditures in progress were $  1,013,000   and $  1,102,000  , respectively.

5. Acquisition of CPI 
  On March 20, 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of CPI Binani, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Binani Industries Limited, located in Winona, Minnesota for a cash purchase price of   $15,000,000  , which expanded the Company's capabilities to include D-LFT and diversified the customer base. The purchase price was subject to working capital adjustments resulting in a reduction in the purchase price of   $488,000  . 
  Cash paid at closing was financed through borrowings under the Company's existing credit facility, as amended and further described in Note 8 below. 
  Consideration was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date as follows: 

The purchase price included consideration for strategic benefits, including an assembled workforce, operational infrastructure and synergistic revenue opportunities, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill.  The goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. 
  The acquisition was not considered significant to the Company's consolidated balance sheet and results of operations. Accordingly, no pro-forma results are provided prior to the effective date of the acquisition.  The Company incurred $  303,000   of expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   associated with the acquisition, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

8. Debt 
  Debt consists of the following: 

Credit Agreement 
    
  In 2008, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, CoreComposites de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with Key Bank National Association to refinance certain existing debt and borrow funds to finance the construction of the Company s manufacturing facility in Mexico. 
    
  Under this Credit Agreement, as amended, the Company received certain loans, subject to the terms and conditions stated in the agreement, which included (1) a   $12,000,000   Capex loan; (2) a   $18,000,000   variable rate revolving line of credit.  The Credit Agreement is secured by a guarantee of each U.S. subsidiary of the Company and by a lien on substantially all of the present and future assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, except that only   65%   of the stock issued by CoreComposites de Mexico, S. de C.V. has been pledged. 

11 

     Table of Contents  

On March 20, 2015, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, CoreComposites de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., entered into a tenth amendment (the  Tenth Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Tenth Amendment, the parties agreed to modify certain terms of the Credit Agreement. These modifications included an extension of the commitment period for the revolving line of credit to May 31, 2017 and an agreement to make a term loan in an original amount of   $15,500,000   to finance the acquisition of CPI assets. On March 30, 2015, the Company repaid   $500,000   of unused proceeds from the original term loan. 
    
  On June 21, 2016, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Corecomposites de Mexico, S. DE R.L. DE C.V., entered into an eleventh amendment (the "Eleventh Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Eleventh Amendment, the parties agreed to modify certain terms of the Credit Agreement. These modifications included an extension of the commitment period on the revolving line of credit to May 31, 2018 and an increase in the letter of credit commitment from   $100,000   to   $250,000  , as provided in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Revolving Line of Credit 
    
  The   $18,000,000   revolving line of credit is collateralized by all of the present and future assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries (except that only 65% of the stock issued by CoreComposites de Mexico, S. de C.V. has been pledged).  The revolving line of credit, as amended, is scheduled to mature on May 31, 2018.  
    
  Bank Covenants 
    
  The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants included in the Credit Agreement with respect to leverage ratios, fixed charge ratios, capital expenditures as well as other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants associated with the loans made under the Credit Agreement as described above. 
  Interest Rate Swap 
  On December 18, 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that became effective May 1, 2009 and continued through May 2016, which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the $12,000,000 Capex loan. Under this agreement, the Company paid a fixed rate of   2.295%   to the counterparty and received a variable rate equal to   LIBOR  . Effective March 31, 2009, the interest terms in the Company s Credit Agreement related to the $12,000,000 Capex loan were amended. The Company then determined that this interest rate swap was no longer highly effective. As a result, the Company discontinued the use of hedge accounting effective as of March 31, 2009 related to this swap, and began recording mark-to-market adjustments within interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.   The pre-tax loss previously recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, totaling $146,000 as of March 31, 2009, was amortized as an increase to interest expense of approximately $2,000 per month, or $1,000 net of tax, through March 31, 2016.   The fair value of the swap as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was a liability of $  0   and $  2,000  , respectively.  The Company recorded interest income of $  0   and $  9,000   for a mark-to-market adjustment of swap fair value for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to this swap. The Company recorded interest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , of $  2,000   and $  30,000  , respectively, for mark-to-market adjustments of this swap. The notional amount of the swap at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $  0   and $  714,000  , respectively. 
  Interest expense included $  0   and $  7,000   of expense for settlements related to the Company's swaps for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense included $  2,000   and $  27,000  , respectively, of expense for settlements related to the Company's swap. 

9. Income Taxes 
  The Company s consolidated balance sheets include a net current deferred tax asset of $  1,575,000   and $  1,598,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and a net non-current deferred tax liability of $  2,252,000   at each of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The Company evaluates the balance of deferred tax assets that will be realized. Such evaluations are based on the premise that the Company is more likely than not to realize deferred tax benefits through the generation of future taxable income. 
  Income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is estimated to be $  2,794,000  , or approximately   34%   of income before income taxes. Income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was estimated to be $  5,069,000  , or approximately   34%   of income before income taxes. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate that unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months. 
  
    12 

     Table of Contents  

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S., Mexico and various state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2013, and is no longer subject to Mexican income tax examinations by Mexican authorities for years prior to 2011.  

10. Share Based Compensation 
  The Company has a Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the  2006 Plan ), as approved by the Company s stockholders in May 2006 and as amended in May 2015. The 2006 Plan allows for grants to directors and employees of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and other incentive awards ( Stock Awards ) up to an aggregate of   3,000,000   awards, each representing a right to buy a share of Core Molding Technologies common stock. Stock Awards can be granted under the 2006 Plan through the earlier of December 31, 2025, or the date the maximum number of available awards under the 2006 Plan have been granted. 
  Restricted Stock 
  The Company grants shares of its common stock to certain directors, officers, and key managers in the form of unvested stock ( Restricted Stock ). These awards are recorded at the market value of Core Molding Technologies  common stock on the date of issuance and amortized ratably as compensation expense over the applicable vesting period. 
  The following summarizes the status of Restricted Stock and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there was $  1,580,000   and $  1,449,000  , respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense related to Restricted Stock granted under the 2006 Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of   1.6   years. Total compensation cost related to restricted stock grants for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $  197,000   and $  183,000  , respectively, all of which was recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. Compensation cost related to restricted stock grants for the   nine    months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $  778,000   and $  609,000  , respectively, all of which was recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. 
    
  Compensation expense for restricted stock is recorded at the fair value at the time of the grant over the vesting period of the restricted stock grant.  The Company does not receive a tax deduction for restricted stock until the restricted stock vests. The tax deduction for restricted stock is based on the fair market value as of the vesting date. Tax expense due for the fair market value as of the grant date in excess of the vested restricted stock was $  16,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Tax benefits received for vested restricted stock in excess of the fair market value as of the grant date was $  145,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , employees surrendered   10,590   and   12,141   shares, respectively, of the Company's common stock to satisfy income tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. 
   
  11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Fair value is measured using the fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies as defined in the authoritative literature. This guidance provides a fair value framework that requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.  
    
  The three levels are defined as follows:   
    
           Level 1 -  
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
     
    13 

     Table of Contents  

Level 2 -  
    Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. 
              Level 3 -  
    Significant unobservable inputs reflecting management's own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. 
       
  The Company s financial instruments consist of debt, interest rate swaps, foreign currency derivatives, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximated their fair value. During 2016, the Company had two Level 2 fair value measurements, which related to the Company s interest rate swap and foreign currency derivatives.  
    
  Interest rate swap 
    
  The Company utilized interest rate swap contracts to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and these swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps (market approach). The interest rate swap, discussed in detail in Note 8, was deemed immaterial to the financial statements. 
    
  There were   no   non-recurring fair value measurements for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Derivative and hedging activities 
  The Company conducts business in Mexico and pays certain expenses in Mexican Pesos. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican Peso, which could impact the Company s operating income and cash flows. To mitigate risk associated with foreign currency exchange, the Company entered into forward contracts to exchange a fixed amount of U.S. dollars for a fixed amount of Mexican Pesos, which will be used to fund future peso cash flows. At inception, all forward contracts are formally documented as cash flow hedges and are measured at fair value each reporting period. Derivatives are formally assessed both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, to ensure that derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, or if the anticipated transaction is no longer probable of occurring, hedge accounting is discontinued, and any future mark-to-market adjustments are recognized in earnings. The effective portion of gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is reported in earnings. The impacts of these contracts were largely offset by gains and losses resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in the Mexican Peso. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no ineffective portion related to the cash flow hedges.

13. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.  ASC Topic 606 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC Topic 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The effective date for ASC Topic 606, as updated by ASU No. 2015-14 in August 2015, has been delayed until the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company is currently assessing the transition alternatives and potential impact the pronouncement and adoption of ASC Topic 606 will have on the Company s financial statements.  Early adoption is permitted, but not before annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740). This update requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The ASU simplifies the current standard, which requires entities to separately present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company will adopt this standard's update as required and does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and also disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. The Company will adopt this standard's update as required and does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ("ASU 2016-09") as part of the FASB simplification initiative. The new standard provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1) excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payment awards will be recognized as income tax expense in the reporting period in which they occur; 2) excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flow; 3) the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur; and 4) increases the tax withholding requirement threshold to qualify for equity classification. The ASU is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU 2016-15"). The new standard provides clarification on the classification of the following eight specific cash flow issues: 1) debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs, 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of borrowing, 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, 4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, 5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, 6) distributions received from equity method investees, 7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The ASU is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this standard update as required and does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Except as required by law, Core Molding Technologies Inc. undertakes no obligation to update these forward looking statements. 
    
  Core Molding Technologies believes that the following factors, among others, could affect its future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made in this report: business conditions in the plastics, transportation, marine and commercial product industries (including slowdown in demand for truck production); federal and state regulations (including engine emission regulations); general economic, social and political environments in the countries in which Core Molding Technologies operates; safety and security conditions in Mexico; dependence upon certain major customers as the primary source of Core Molding Technologies  sales revenues; efforts of Core Molding Technologies to expand its customer base; the ability to develop new and innovative products and to diversify markets, materials and processes and increase operational enhancements; the actions of competitors, customers, and suppliers; failure of Core Molding Technologies  suppliers to perform their obligations; the availability of raw materials; inflationary pressures; new technologies; regulatory matters; labor relations; the loss or inability of Core Molding Technologies to attract and retain key personnel; the Company's ability to successfully identify, evaluate and manage potential acquisitions and to benefit from and properly integrate any completed acquisitions; federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations; the availability of capital; the ability of Core Molding Technologies to provide on-time delivery to customers, which may require additional shipping expenses to ensure on-time delivery or otherwise result in late fees; risk of cancellation or rescheduling of orders; management s decision to pursue new products or businesses which involve additional costs, risks or capital expenditures; and other risks identified from time to time in Core Molding Technologies  other public documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those described in Item 1A of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  Description of the Company 
    
  Core Molding Technologies is a manufacturer of sheet molding compound ("SMC") and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics. The Company specializes in large-format moldings and offers a wide range of fiberglass processes, including compression molding of SMC, glass mat thermoplastics, bulk molding compounds and direct long-fiber thermoplastics (D-LFT); spray-up, hand-lay-up, and resin transfer molding ("RTM"). Additionally, the Company offers reaction injection molding, utilizing dicyclopentadiene technology. Core Molding Technologies serves a wide variety of markets, including medium and heavy-duty truck, marine, automotive, agriculture, construction and other commercial products.  Product sales to heavy and medium-duty truck markets accounted for   69%   and   78%   of the Company s sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The demand for Core Molding Technologies  products is primarily affected by economic conditions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Core Molding Technologies  manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component. Accordingly, during periods of changing demand, the profitability of Core Molding Technologies  operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations. 
    
  In 1996, Core Molding Technologies acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Columbus Plastics, a wholly owned operating unit of Navistar s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late 1980. Columbus Plastics, located in Columbus, Ohio, was a compounder and compression molder of SMC. In 1998, Core Molding Technologies began operations at its second facility in Gaffney, South Carolina, and in 2001, the Company established a manufacturing presence in Mexico by acquiring certain assets of Airshield Corporation. As a result of this acquisition, Core Molding Technologies expanded its fiberglass molding capabilities to include the spray up, hand-lay-up open mold processes and RTM closed molding. In 2004, the Company acquired substantially all the operating assets of Keystone Restyling Products, Inc., a privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced products for the automotive-aftermarket industry. In 2005, Core Molding Technologies acquired certain assets of the Cincinnati Fiberglass Division of Diversified Glass, Inc., a Batavia, Ohio-based, privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced plastic components supplied primarily to the heavy-duty truck market. In 2009, the Company completed construction of a production facility in Matamoros, Mexico that replaced its leased facility. Most recently in 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of CPI Binani, Inc. ("CPI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of

Binani Industries Limited, located in Winona, Minnesota, which expanded the Company's process capabilities to include D-LFT and diversified its customer base. 
   
  Overview 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded net income of   $5,379,000  , or   $0.71   per basic and   $0.70   diluted share, compared with net income of   $9,719,000  , or   $1.28   per basic and   $1.27   per diluted share for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Product sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased approximately   22%   to   $113,159,000   as compared to $  145,612,000   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to decreased demand from heavy duty truck customers, partially offset by additional sales from CPI, which was acquired in March 2015. 
    
  Looking forward we expect product sales to continue to be lower than prior year as industry analysts currently forecast North American heavy duty truck production levels in 2016 to be 30% below prior year and 2017 production levels to be 10% lower than 2016.  As a result of the Company's industry diversification and new business efforts over the past several years, we expect the percentage decrease in total product sales in 2016 compared to 2015 to be less than the decrease in product sales to our heavy duty truck customers.  

Results of Operations 
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016  , as Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $41,336,000   and   $48,049,000  , respectively. Included in total sales were tooling project sales of   $7,520,000   and   $3,806,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Tooling project sales result primarily from customer approval and acceptance of molds and assembly equipment specific to their products as well as other non-production services. These sales are sporadic in nature and fluctuate in regard to scope and related revenue on a period-to-period basis. Product sales, excluding tooling project sales, were approximately   24%     lower   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period a year ago.  This decrease in sales is primarily the result of lower demand from customers in the heavy duty truck market, partially offset by an increase in demand from customers in the marine market. 
    
  Sales to Navistar totaled $  10,045,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  14,544,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in total sales was $  470,000   of tooling sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  2,325,000   for the same three months in   2015  . Product sales   decreased     22%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a change in demand, partially offset by new business awards. 
    
  Sales to Volvo totaled $  11,690,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  13,467,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in total sales was $  5,353,000   of tooling sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  387,000   for the same three months in   2015  .  Product sales to Volvo   decreased     52%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a change in demand.  
    
  Sales to PACCAR totaled $  6,905,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  8,472,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in total sales was $  18,000   of tooling sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  63,000   for the same three months in   2015  . Product sales to PACCAR   decreased     18%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a change in demand and lower sales for certain products reaching the end of their product life, which were partially offset by new business awards. 
    
  Sales to Yamaha totaled $  3,602,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  2,067,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Product sales to Yamaha   increased     74%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a change in demand and timing of the customer's annual seasonal shutdown. 
    
  Sales to other customers for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $  9,094,000  , compared to $  9,499,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in total sales was $  1,679,000   of tooling sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  1,031,000   for the same three months in   2015  . Product sales to other customers   decreased     12%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of the prior year, due a change in demand from other customers in the heavy truck and automotive markets. 
    
  Gross margin was approximately   13.5%   of sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   17.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The gross margin decline, as a percent of sales, was due to an unfavorable net change  
  
    18 

     Table of Contents  

in production costs and product mix of 3.5%, lower fixed cost leverage of 0.9% related to the decrease in sales and unfavorable net changes in selling price and material costs of 0.2%, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate effect of 0.8%. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A ) was $  3,924,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  4,409,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in SG A expense primarily resulted from lower profit sharing expense of $288,000 due to lower earnings and lower travel expense of $86,000. 
    
  Interest expense totaled $  67,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to interest expense of $  95,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower average outstanding debt balance during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .   
    
  Income tax expense for both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately 35% of total income before income taxes. The Company recorded net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $1,029,000  , or   $0.13   per basic and diluted share, compared with net income of   $2,484,000  , or   $0.33   per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016  , as Compared to Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $125,810,000   and   $152,505,000  , respectively. Included in total sales were tooling project sales of $  12,651,000   and $  6,893,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Tooling project sales result primarily from customer approval and acceptance of molds and assembly equipment specific to their products as well as other non-production services. These sales are sporadic in nature and fluctuate in regard to scope and related revenue on a period-to-period basis. Product sales, excluding tooling project sales, were approximately   22%     lower   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period a year ago.  This decrease in sales is primarily the result of lower demand from customers in the heavy truck market, partially offset by additional sales from CPI, which was acquired in March 2015. 
    
  Sales to Navistar totaled $  32,470,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  41,893,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in total sales was $  1,166,000   of tooling sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  3,373,000   for the same   nine   months in   2015  . Product sales   decreased     19%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a change in demand, partially offset by new business awards. 
    
  Sales to Volvo totaled   $29,266,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $43,305,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in total sales was $  5,801,000   of tooling sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  1,585,000   for the same   nine   months in   2015  .  Product sales to Volvo   decreased     44%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a change in demand.  
    
  Sales to PACCAR totaled $  21,888,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  28,386,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in total sales was $  3,454,000   of tooling sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  819,000   for the same   nine   months in   2015  . Product sales to PACCAR   decreased     33%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to lower sales for products reaching the end of their product life and a change in demand, partially offset by new business awards. 
    
  Sales to Yamaha totaled $  11,658,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  11,551,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Product sales to Yamaha   increased     1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a change in demand. 
    
  Sales to other customers for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $  30,528,000  , compared to $  27,370,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Product sales to other customers   increased     8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year.  The increase primarily relates to new sales due to a full   nine   months of sales from CPI, which was acquired in March 2015, partially offset by lower demand from other customers in the heavy truck market. 
    
  Gross margin was approximately   16.5%   of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   18.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The gross margin decline, as a percent of sales, was due to lower fixed cost leverage of 1.4% related to the decrease in sales and an unfavorable net change in production costs and product mix of 2.0%, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate effect of 1.0% and favorable net changes in selling price and material costs of 0.3%.

Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A ) was $  12,361,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  13,294,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in SG A expense primarily resulted from lower profit sharing expense of $1,045,000 and lower travel of $112,000. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher labor and benefit expenses of $350,000. In addition, SG A expense in 2015 included a non-recurring miscellaneous gain of $90,000 associated with the collection of foreign sales tax receivables. 
    
  Interest expense totaled $  233,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to interest expense of $  237,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower average outstanding debt balance in 2016.   
    
  Income tax expense for both the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   34%   of total income before income taxes. The Company recorded net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $5,379,000  , or   $0.71   per basic and   $0.70   per diluted share, compared with net income of   $9,719,000  , or   $1.28   per basic and   $1.27   per diluted share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company s primary sources of funds have been cash generated from operating activities and borrowings from third parties. Primary cash requirements are for operating expenses, increases in working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of long-term debt and business acquisitions. The Company from time to time will enter in to foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risk of foreign exchange movements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling   $5,772,000  , compared to none outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Cash   provided by   operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $20,383,000  . Net income of   $5,379,000   positively impacted operating cash flows. Non-cash deductions of depreciation and amortization included in net income amounted to $  4,658,000  .  Changes in working capital   increased   cash   provided by   operating activities by $  9,900,000  , which primarily related to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory, offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  
    
  Cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1,901,000  , which all relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment.  The Company anticipates spending up to $2,000,000 during the remainder of 2016 on property, plant and equipment purchases for all of the Company's operations.  At   September 30, 2016  , purchase commitments for capital expenditures in progress were $  1,013,000  .  The Company anticipates using cash from operations to finance this capital investment. 
    
  Cash used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $  3,114,000  , which primarily consisted of scheduled repayments of principal on the Company's outstanding Capex loan and Term loan of $  2,964,000  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $24,311,000   in cash on hand, and an available balance on the revolving line of credit of $18,000,000.   
    
  The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants included in the Credit Agreement with respect to leverage ratios, fixed charge ratios, capital expenditures as well as other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants. 
    
  Management regularly evaluates the Company s ability to effectively meet its debt covenants. Based on the Company s forecasts, which are based on industry analysts  estimates of heavy and medium-duty truck production volumes, as well as other assumptions, management believes that the Company will be able to maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the next 12 months. Management believes that cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet the Company s liquidity needs for the next 12 months. If a material adverse change in the financial position of Core Molding Technologies should occur, or if actual sales or expenses are substantially different than what has been forecasted, Core Molding Technologies  liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company did not have or experience any  material changes outside the ordinary course of business as to contractual obligations, including long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company s balance sheet under GAAP, as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 
  Accounts receivable allowances:   Management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $  1,000   and $  40,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Management also records estimates for chargebacks for customer returns and deductions, discounts offered to customers, and price adjustments. Should customer chargebacks fluctuate from the estimated amounts, additional allowances may be required. The Company reduced accounts receivable for chargebacks by $259,000 at   September 30, 2016   and $523,000 at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Inventories:   Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. The inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage. The Company has recorded an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory of $790,000 at   September 30, 2016   and $863,000 at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Derivative instruments:   Derivative instruments are utilized to manage exposure to fluctuations in the United States dollar to Mexican peso exchange rate. All derivative instruments are formally documented as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value at each reporting period. Gains and losses related to currency forward contracts are deferred and recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity and then subsequently recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the hedged item affects net income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately. For additional information on derivative instruments, see Note 11.  
  Long-Lived Assets:   Long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles. The recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by an analysis of operating results and consideration of other significant events or changes in the business environment. The Company evaluates whether impairment exists for property, plant and equipment on the basis of undiscounted expected future cash flows from operations before interest. There was no impairment of the Company's long-lived assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2015  .  
  Goodwill and Other Intangibles:   The Company has recorded $2,403,000 of goodwill as a result of two acquisitions. In 2001, the Company acquired certain assets of Airshield Corporation, and as a result, recorded goodwill in the amount of $1,097,000. The Company also acquired substantially all of the assets of CPI on March 20, 2015, which resulted in approximately $1,306,000 of goodwill.  

21 

     Table of Contents  

If the Company's fair value is determined to be more likely than not impaired based on the one-step qualitative approach, a quantitative valuation to estimate the fair value of the Company is performed. Fair value measurements are based on a projected discounted cash flow valuation model, in accordance with ASC 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.  
    
  There was no impairment of the Company's goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2015, and no indicators of impairment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Self-Insurance:   The Company is self-insured with respect to its Columbus and Batavia, Ohio, Gaffney, South Carolina and Brownsville, Texas medical, dental and vision claims and Columbus and Batavia, Ohio workers  compensation claims, all of which are subject to stop-loss insurance thresholds.  The Company has recorded an estimated liability for self-insured medical and dental claims incurred but not reported and worker s compensation claims incurred but not reported at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of $1,190,000 and $1,074,000, respectively. 
  Post-retirement benefits:   Management records an accrual for post-retirement costs associated with the health care plan sponsored by Core Molding Technologies. Should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves, additional provisions may be required. In particular, increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse effect on Core Molding Technologies  operations. The effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K.  Core Molding Technologies had a liability for post retirement healthcare benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of   $8,978,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   $9,006,000   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Revenue Recognition:   Revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped and title transfers. Allowances for returned products and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized. Tooling revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership. Progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Tooling in progress can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is dependent upon the stage of tooling projects and the related billing and expense payment timetable for individual projects and therefore does not necessarily reflect projected income or loss from tooling projects. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a net liability related to tooling in progress of $  1,072,000  , which represented approximately $21,997,000 of progress tooling billings and $20,925,000 of progress tooling expenses. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a net liability related to tooling in progress of $  2,271,000  , which represented approximately $21,967,000 of progress tooling billings and $19,696,000 of progress tooling expenses. 
  Income taxes:   The Company s consolidated balance sheets include a net current deferred tax asset of $  1,575,000   and $  1,598,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and a net non-current deferred tax liability of $  2,252,000   at each of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The Company evaluates the balance of deferred tax assets that will be realized. Such evaluations are based on the premise that the Company is more likely than not to realize deferred tax benefits through the generation of future taxable income. For more information, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K.

    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     Core Molding Technologies  primary market risk results from changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations. Core Molding Technologies is also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations associated with the Mexican Peso. Core Molding Technologies does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. The Company may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. 
  Core Molding Technologies has the following three items that are sensitive to market risks: (1) Revolving Line of Credit  and Term Loan under the Credit Agreement, which bears a variable interest rate; (2) foreign currency purchases in which the Company purchases Mexican pesos with United States dollars to meet certain obligations that arise due to operations at the facility located in Mexico; and (3) raw material purchases in which Core Molding Technologies purchases various resins and fiberglass for use in production. The prices and availability of these materials are affected by the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as processing capacity versus demand. 
  Assuming a hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices, Core Molding Technologies would be impacted by an increase in raw material costs, which would have an adverse effect on operating margins. 
  Assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the United States dollar to Mexican Peso exchange rate, the Company would be impacted  by an increase in operating costs, which would have an adverse effect on operating margins. 
  Assuming a hypothetical 10% change in short-term interest rates, interest paid on the Term Loan would have been impacted, as the interest rate on these loans is based upon LIBOR. It would not, however, have a material effect on earnings before tax.

    Controls and Procedures 
     As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were (i) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
  There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred in the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  SECTION 302 CERTIFICATION  
  I, Kevin L. Barnett, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Core Molding Technologies, Inc.;  
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this quarterly report;  
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and we have:  
              a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this annual report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of the annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
              a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
