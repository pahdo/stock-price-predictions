In this filing, the name  CEC  refers to the parent holding company, Caesars Entertainment Corporation, exclusive of its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires. The words  Company,   Caesars,   Caesars Entertainment,   we,   our,  and  us  refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation, inclusive of its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires. 
  This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   10-K ). 
  We also refer to (i) our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements as our  Financial Statements,  (ii) our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as our  Statements of Operations,  and (iii) our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as our  Balance Sheets.  
  Note 1   -   Description of Business 
  Organization 
  CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations of its own. CEC owns   100%   of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC ( CERP ) and an interest in Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ( CGP ). We also consolidate the results of Caesars Interactive Entertainment, LLC (formerly Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc.) ( CIE ), a wholly owned subsidiary of CGP that operates an online games business and owns the World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) tournaments and brand. CIE sold its social and mobile games business (the  SMG Business ) on   September 23, 2016  , as discussed below. As of   September 30, 2016  , CERP and CGP owned a total of   12   casino properties in the United States,   eight   of which are in Las Vegas. These   eight   casino properties represented   65%   of consolidated net revenues for both the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  CEC also holds a majority interest in Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. ( CEOC ). The results of CEOC and its subsidiaries are no longer consolidated with Caesars subsequent to CEOC and certain of its United States subsidiaries (the  Debtors ) voluntarily filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) on   January 15, 2015  . 
  Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC 
  Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC ( CES ) is a services joint venture formed by CERP, CEOC, and Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC ( CGPH ) (collectively, the  Members ). CES provides certain corporate and administrative services for the Members  casino properties and related entities, including substantially all of the   28   casino properties owned by CEOC, and   7   casinos owned by unrelated third parties (including   four   Indian tribal casinos). CES manages certain assets for the casinos to which it provides services and the other assets it owns, licenses or controls, and employs certain of the corresponding employees. Under the terms of the joint venture and the Omnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement, CEC and its operating subsidiaries continue to have access to the services historically provided to us by CEOC and its employees, its trademarks, and its programs despite the CEOC bankruptcy filing. 
  Reportable Segments 
  We view each casino property as an operating segment and currently aggregate all such casino properties into   two   reportable segments based on management s view, which aligns with their ownership and underlying credit structures: CERP and CGP. 
  Through June 30, 2016, we aggregated the operating segments within CGP into two separate reportable segments: Caesars Growth Partners Casino Properties and Developments ( CGP Casinos ) and CIE. On   September 23, 2016  , CIE sold the SMG Business for cash consideration of   $4.4 billion   (the  CIE Proceeds ), subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and retained only its WSOP and regulated online real money gaming businesses. The SMG Business represented the majority of CIE s operations and was classified as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Historical results of the SMG Business have been recast as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , and the related assets and liabilities have been recast as held for sale as of   December 31, 2015   (See   Note 14  ). After excluding the SMG Business from CIE s continuing operations, the remaining CIE business is not material, and we no longer consider CIE to be a separate reportable segment from CGP Casinos. Therefore, CGP Casinos and CIE have been combined for all periods presented to form the CGP segment. Additionally, CEOC remained a reportable segment until its deconsolidation effective   January 15, 2015  .

Announced Merger with Caesars Acquisition Company 
  In 2014, CEC and Caesars Acquisition Company ( CAC ) entered into a merger agreement, which was amended and restated on July 9, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company (the  Merger ). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, each share of CAC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger will be converted into, and become exchangeable for, shares of CEC common stock in a ratio to ensure that holders of CAC common stock receive shares equal to 27.5% of the outstanding CEC common stock on a fully diluted basis (prior to the conversion of the CEC Convertible Notes being issued as part of the Restructuring, as defined below) (the  Exchange Ratio ). The Exchange Ratio may be subject to change, and CEC or CAC may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances.    
  We expect the Merger to be accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control, which will result in CAC being consolidated into Caesars at book value as an equity transaction. 
  Going Concern 
  Overview 
  As a result of the following circumstances, we have substantial doubt about CEC s ability to continue as a going concern: 
             
    we have limited unrestricted cash available to meet the financial commitments of CEC, primarily resulting from significant expenditures made to (1) defend against the litigation matters disclosed below and (2) support a plan of reorganization for CEOC (the  Restructuring  
                
    we have made material future commitments to support the Restructuring described below; and 
                
    we are a defendant in litigation relating to certain CEOC transactions dating back to 2010 and other legal matters (see   Note 3  ) that could result in one or more adverse rulings against us. 
     CEC does not currently have sufficient cash to meet its financial commitments to support the Restructuring that are due when CEOC ultimately emerges from bankruptcy or to satisfy the potential obligations that would arise in the event of an adverse ruling on one or all of the litigation matters disclosed below. The completion of the Merger is expected to allow CEC to fulfill its financial commitments in support of the Restructuring. However, if the Merger is not completed for any reason, CEC would still be liable for many of these obligations. In addition, although under the terms of the Restructuring, all related litigation is expected to be resolved, the outstanding litigation matters are only stayed pending confirmation of the Restructuring and CEOC s emergence from bankruptcy. 
  The cash forecast at CEC currently contemplates liquidity to be sufficient through December 31, 2016. In addition, CEC entered into the CIE Proceeds and Reservation Rights Agreement (as amended on October 7, 2016) with CIE, CEOC and CAC (the  CIE Proceeds Agreement ), which allows for up to   $235 million   of the proceeds from the SMG Business sale to be distributed to CEC in order to pay certain fees in support of the Restructuring ( CEC Expense Amounts ). After taking into account the cash available to pay the CEC Expense Amounts, CEC expects to have sufficient cash to meet its ongoing obligations as they come due. However, there are restrictions governing when and how the cash designated for CEC Expense Amounts can be used, pursuant to the terms of the Second Lien RSA (defined below) (see   Note 2  ). CEC also expects to gain access to the remaining proceeds from the sale of the SMG Business upon completion of the Merger, which will be used to fund its other commitments in support of the Restructuring. 
  If CEC is unable to access additional sources of cash when needed, in the event of a material adverse ruling on one or all of the litigation matters disclosed below, or if CEOC does not emerge from bankruptcy on a timely basis on terms and under circumstances satisfactory to CEC, it is likely that CEC would seek reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
  We believe that CERP and CGP s cash and cash equivalents, their cash flows from operations, and/or financing available under their separate revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet their normal operating requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures, and to fund debt service during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

CEOC Reorganization 
  On   October 20, 2016  , the Debtors filed an amended plan of reorganization (the  Third Amended Plan ) with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago (the  Bankruptcy Court ) that replaces and provides for different terms than the Initial Plan filed in October 2015 and the second amended plan filed on June 28, 2016. CEC, CAC, the Debtors and CEOC s major creditor groups have agreed to support the Third Amended Plan. The confirmation hearing for the Third Amended Plan has been scheduled for January 2017. 
  In connection with the Third Amended Plan, the following agreements with respect to the CEOC reorganization were either entered into or amended, as needed (collectively, the  RSAs ): 
           (a) 
    Sixth Amended and Restated Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement, dated October 4, 2016, with certain parties holding claims under CEOC s first lien notes (the  First Lien Bond RSA  
              (b) 
    Second Amended Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement, dated October 4, 2016, with certain parties holding claims under CEOC s first lien credit agreement (the  First Lien Bank RSA  
              (c) 
    Restructuring Support, Forbearance and Settlement Agreement, dated October 4, 2016, with certain parties holding claims under CEOC s second lien note agreements (the  Second Lien RSA  
              (d) 
    Amendment No. 1 to First Amended and Restated Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement, dated October 4, 2016, with certain parties holding claims under CEOC s subsidiary guaranteed notes (the  SGN RSA  
              (e) 
    First Amended and Restated Restructuring Support, Settlement, and Contribution Agreement, dated July 9, 2016, with CEOC (the  CEC RSA  
              (f) 
    Amended and Restated Restructuring Support Agreement, dated July 9, 2016, with CAC and CEOC (the  CAC RSA   and 
              (g) 
    Restructuring Support and Settlement Agreement, dated June 22, 2016, with the unsecured claimholders  committee in the Chapter 11 cases (the  UCC RSA ). 
     The  Effective Date  of the Restructuring (the material terms of which are contained in the RSAs and the Third Amended Plan) is the date upon which all required conditions of the Restructuring have been satisfied or waived and on which the CEOC reorganization and related transactions become effective. 
  As a result of entering into the Third Amended Plan and the RSAs, we believe it is probable that certain obligations described in the Third Amended Plan and the RSAs will ultimately be settled, and therefore, we have accrued the items described in the table below that are estimable in accrued restructuring and support expenses on the Balance Sheets. During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we updated our accruals based on the terms of the Third Amended Plan and the RSAs and recorded an additional   $3.0 billion   in deconsolidation and restructuring of CEOC and other in the statement of operations, which increased our total expense to   $5.3 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  We estimated the total consideration we expect to provide in support of the Restructuring, which includes a combination of cash, CEC common stock, and CEC convertible notes. Accrued restructuring and support expenses does not include the consideration that will be issued as part of the acquisition of OpCo (as defined below), which will be recorded when the transaction is consummated.

Forbearance Fees and Other Payments to Creditors.   CEC has agreed to pay certain fees in exchange for CEOC s major creditors agreeing to forebear from exercising their rights and remedies under certain of CEOC s credit agreements and to stay all pending litigation. The amounts disclosed above are reported net of   $148 million   that was paid during the fourth quarter of 2015. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, CEC paid an additional   $6 million  . 
  Bank Guaranty Settlement.   In 2014, CEOC amended its senior secured credit facilities (the  Bank Amendment ) resulting in, among other things, a modification of CEC s guarantee under the senior secured credit facilities such that CEC s guarantee was limited to a guarantee of collection ( CEC Collection Guarantee ) with respect to obligations owed to the lenders who consented to the Bank Amendment. The CEC Collection Guarantee requires the creditors to exhaust all rights and remedies at law and in equity that the creditors or their agents may have against CEOC or any of its subsidiaries and its and their respective property to collect, or obtain payment of, the guaranteed amounts. Pursuant to the Third Amended Plan, the CEOC creditors have agreed to eliminate the CEC Collection Guarantee, and we recorded   $734 million   as an estimate of the liability based on the terms of the Bank Guaranty Settlement agreement. 
  Issuance of CEC Common Shares.   CEC will issue CEC common shares for the settlement of claims and potential claims and is obligated to repurchase at least   $1.0 billion   worth of the issued shares at a fixed price. As of   September 30, 2016  , our accrual includes the   $1.0 billion   repurchase obligation plus the estimated fair value of   $1.7 billion   for the net shares that we expect to issue after satisfying the repurchase obligation, which is subject to remeasurement on a quarterly basis. Additionally, we have accrued a liability of   $29 million   for the fair value associated with the creditors  right to require CEC to repurchase up to   $200 million   worth of the newly-issued CEC common shares. 
  CEC s majority shareholders, the Sponsors (as defined in Note 16), have agreed to provide their CEC common shares as consideration in support of the Restructuring and for the settlement of claims and potential claims. Therefore, our accrual also includes the fair value of the shares held by the Sponsors. We will reduce the estimate of our obligation upon receipt of the shares from the Sponsors, with an offsetting amount recorded to equity, which is expected to occur on the Effective Date. See   Note 7   for additional information on fair value measurements and how this value was determined. 
  Issuance of CEC Convertible Notes.   CEC will issue   $1.1 billion   in face value of convertible notes to the CEOC creditors for the settlement of claims and potential claims, and our accrual represents the estimated fair value of the notes to be issued. 
  Payment of Creditor Expenses, Settlement Charges, and Other Fees.   Pursuant to the Third Amended Plan, CEC has agreed to pay certain professional fees incurred by CEOC s creditors and has agreed to pay other ancillary fees and settlement amounts. 
  Payment to CEOC  . In addition, and separate from the transactions and agreements described above, because there was not a comprehensive out-of-court restructuring of CEOC's debt securities or a prepackaged or prearranged in-court restructuring with requisite voting support from each of the first and second lien secured creditor classes by February 15, 2016, a debt agreement entered into by CEOC in 2014 contemplates an additional payment to CEOC of   $35 million   from CEC. During the first quarter of 2015, we accrued this liability in accrued restructuring and support expenses on the Balance Sheet, and this amount is currently due and payable. The CIE Proceeds Agreement designates a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the SMG Business for the purpose of paying this obligation upon CEOC s emergence from bankruptcy.

Other Commitments Under the Third Amended Plan 
  The following represents other commitments or potential obligations to which CEC has agreed as part of the Third Amended Plan and certain of the RSAs, none of which have been accrued as of   September 30, 2016  . 
               Purchase 100% of OpCo common stock for $700 million    (1)  
      Issuance of CEC common shares in exchange for OpCo preferred stock 
      Purchase 5% of PropCo equity for $91 million    (2)  
      PropCo has right of first refusal on the real property assets associated with all new domestic non-Las Vegas gaming facility opportunities, with CEC or OpCo leasing such properties 
      PropCo receives a call right to purchase the real property assets associated with Harrah s Atlantic City, Harrah s Laughlin, and Harrah s New Orleans (subject to the terms of the CERP and CGPH credit agreements) 
      Guarantee of OpCo s payment obligations to PropCo under the leases of the CEOC Properties 
      Guarantee of OpCo debt received by the First Lien Bank Lenders and First Lien Noteholders 

____________________ 
            (1)   
     OpCo  refers to the proposed entity resulting from the Restructuring that will operate the CEOC Properties under a lease with PropCo.  CEOC Properties  refers to those properties owned by CEOC as of the Petition Date. 
               (2)   
     PropCo  refers to the proposed entity resulting from the Restructuring that will own the real property assets associated with the CEOC Properties as of the Effective Date. This commitment is dependent on the ultimate legal structure of the entities formed as part of the Restructuring. 
     The acquisitions of OpCo equity and PropCo equity represent future investment transactions and will be recorded when (or if) the transactions are consummated. The PropCo right of refusal and call right to purchase the real property assets associated with the listed properties are either not estimable or not financial obligations that would require accrual. The guarantees of OpCo s payment and debt obligations relate to OpCo commitments that do not yet exist, and thus do not give rise to any obligations for CEC as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Liquidity 
  Caesars Entertainment is a highly-leveraged company and had   $6.9 billion   in consolidated debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . As a result, a significant portion of our liquidity needs are for debt service, including significant interest payments. As detailed in   Note 9  , our consolidated estimated debt service (including principal and interest) for the remainder of 2016 is   $286 million   and   $9.3 billion   thereafter to maturity. See   Note 9   for details of our debt outstanding and related restrictive covenants. This includes, among other information, details of our individual borrowings outstanding and each subsidiary s annual maturities of long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Consolidated cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, as shown in the table above include amounts held by CERP, CGP, and CES, which are not readily available to CEC.  Other  reflects CEC and certain of its direct subsidiaries, including its insurance captives. 
  CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations, employees, or material debt issuances of its own. Its primary assets as of   September 30, 2016  , consist of   $188 million   in cash and cash equivalents and its ownership interests in CEOC, CERP and CGP. CEC s cash includes   $107 million   held by its insurance captives. Provisions included in certain debt arrangements entered into by CERP and CGP (and/or their respective subsidiaries) substantially restrict the ability of CERP, CGP, and their subsidiaries

to provide dividends to CEC. In addition, CEC does not receive any financial benefit from CEOC during CEOC s bankruptcy, as all earnings and cash flows are retained by CEOC for the benefit of its creditors. 
  CEC has no requirement to fund the operations of CERP, CGP, or their subsidiaries. Accordingly, CEC cash outflows are primarily used for corporate development opportunities and other corporate-level activity, including defending itself in the litigation in which it has been named as a defendant (see   Note 3  ). In the first quarter of 2016,   $100 million   in cash that had previously been restricted by management for use in a casino development project became available for CEC s use in operations. In addition, as described previously, CEC is able to fund certain eligible CEC Expense Amounts from   $235 million   of the proceeds from the sale of the SMG Business. Otherwise, CEC is generally limited to raising additional capital through borrowings or equity transactions because it has no operations of its own and the restrictions on its subsidiaries under lending arrangements generally prevent the distribution of cash from the subsidiaries to CEC, except for certain restricted payments that CERP and CGPH are authorized to make in accordance with their lending arrangements.

  In addition to financial commitments described above, we have the following outstanding uncertainties for which we have not accrued any amounts, all of which are described in   Note 3  :

     Report of Bankruptcy Examiner 
  The Bankruptcy Court engaged an examiner to investigate possible claims CEOC might have against CEC and/or other entities and individuals. On March 15, 2016, the examiner released his report, which identifies a variety of potential claims against CEC and certain individuals related to a number of transactions dating back to 2009. Most of the examiner s findings are premised on his view that CEOC was  insolvent  at the time of the applicable transactions and that CEOC did not receive fair value for assets transferred. The examiner s report includes his conclusions on the relative strengths of these possible claims, many of which are described in   Note 3  . The examiner calculates an estimated range of potential damages for these potential claims from   $3.6 billion   to   $5.1 billion  , and such calculation does not account for probability of success, likelihood of collection, or the time or cost of litigation. 
  While this report was prepared at the request of the Bankruptcy Court, none of the findings included therein are legally binding on the Bankruptcy Court or any party. CEC contests most of the examiner s findings, including his findings that CEOC was insolvent at relevant times, that there were breaches of fiduciary duty, that CEOC did not receive fair value for assets transferred, that there were fraudulent transfers, and as to the calculation of damages. CEC believes that each of the challenged transactions was undertaken to provide CEOC with the liquidity and resources required to sustain it and provide time to recover from significant market challenges. 
  CEC believes that the conclusion of the examination and the release of the report was a necessary step to facilitate the settlement discussions in the CEOC bankruptcy proceedings. The Third Amended Plan and the related RSAs reflect the current status of the ongoing effort to arrive at a consensual plan providing for the timely emergence of CEOC from bankruptcy.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Note 2       Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of Caesars have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable for interim periods, and therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for complete financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The results for the interim periods reflect all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The results of operations for our interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire   2016   fiscal year. All amounts presented in these consolidated condensed financial statements and notes thereto exclude the operating results and cash flows of CEOC subsequent to   January 15, 2015  , and the assets, liabilities, and equity of CEOC as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The results of operations and cash flows primarily related to the SMG Business were classified as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and the historical results have been recast as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The related assets and liabilities have been recast as held for sale as of   December 31, 2015   (see   Note 14  ). 
  Consolidation of Subsidiaries and Variable Interest Entities 
  We consolidate into our financial statements the accounts of all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) for which we or one of our consolidated subsidiaries is the primary beneficiary. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby (1) affiliates that are more than 50% owned are consolidated; (2) investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method where we have determined that we have significant influence over the entities; and (3) investments in affiliates of 20% or less are generally accounted for using the cost method. 
  Consolidation of CGP 
  Because the equity holders in CGP receive returns disproportionate to their voting interests and substantially all the activities of CGP are related to Caesars, CGP has been determined to be a VIE. CAC is the sole voting member of CGP. Common control exists between CAC and Caesars through the majority beneficial ownership of both by Hamlet Holdings (as defined in   Note 16  ). The assets held by CGP originally came from Caesars and continue to be intrinsically closely associated with Caesars through the nature of the business, as well as ongoing service and management agreements. Additionally, CEC is expected to receive the majority of the benefits or absorb the majority of the losses from its higher economic participation in CGP. Since CEC is more closely associated with CGP than CAC, we have determined that CEC is the primary beneficiary of CGP and is required to consolidate them. Neither CAC nor CGP guarantees any of CEC s debt, and the creditors or beneficial holders of CGP have no recourse to the general credit of CEC. 
  CGP generated net revenues of   $422 million   and   $417 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.3 billion   and   $1.2 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net income attributable to Caesars related to CGP was   $3.2 billion   for both the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Net loss attributable to Caesars related to CGP was   $5 million   and   $2 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  CGP was obligated to issue non-voting membership units to CEC in 2016 to the extent that the earnings from CIE s social and mobile games business exceeded a specified threshold amount as of   December 31, 2015  . In April 2016, CGP issued   32 million   Class B non-voting units to CEC, resulting in CEC s economic ownership in CGP increasing from   57.4%   to   61.2%  . However, there was no effect on our financial statements from this transaction. 
  Our consolidated restricted cash includes amounts held by CGP of   $3.4 billion   and   $12 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the majority of the balance is restricted under the terms of the CIE Proceeds Agreement, which requires a portion of the CIE Proceeds be deposited into the CIE escrow account (the "CIE Escrow Account"). Amounts may be distributed from the CIE Escrow Account only: (i) pursuant to the terms of the term sheet included in the CIE Proceeds Agreement and the agreement entered into among Wilmington Trust, National Association, CIE and CEOC,  
  
    13 

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

governing the CIE Escrow Account, (ii) with the joint written consent of CIE and CEOC, or (iii) pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
  Consolidation of CES 
  A steering committee acts in the role of a board of managers for CES with each Member entitled to appoint one representative to the steering committee. Each Member, through its representative, is entitled to a single vote on the steering committee; accordingly, the voting power of the Members does not equate to their ownership percentages. Therefore, w  hen CES was formed, we determined that it was a VIE, and we concluded that CERP was required to consolidate it. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, we implemented the Financial Accounting Standard Board s (the  FASB ) Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-02, which amended Topic 810,   Consolidations  . Applying the amended guidance had   no   effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Under the guidance in effect prior to ASU No. 2015-02, CERP was determined to be the primary beneficiary of CES, and we consolidated CES through our consolidation of CERP. Under the amended guidance, in determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity must evaluate whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance through both its direct economic interests in the VIE and its indirect economic interests in the VIE held through related parties. Under the new criteria, when a decision maker exists that holds both power and benefits through its related parties and neither related party holds such power and benefits on their own, the decision maker is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we concluded that CEC is the primary beneficiary because our combined economic interest in CES, through our subsidiaries, represents a controlling financial interest. 
  Expenses incurred by CES are allocated to the casino properties directly or to the Members according to their allocation percentages, subject to annual review. Therefore, CES is a "pass-through" entity   that serves as an agent on behalf of the Members at a cost-basis, and is contractually required to fully allocate its costs. CES is designed to have no operating cash flows of its own, and any net income or loss is generally immaterial and is typically subject to allocation to the Members in the subsequent period. 
  Consolidation Considerations for CEOC 
  CEOC s filing for reorganization was a reconsideration event for Caesars Entertainment to reevaluate whether consolidation of CEOC continued to be appropriate. We concluded that CEOC is a VIE and that we are not the primary beneficiary of CEOC; therefore, we no longer consolidate CEOC. 
  Transactions with CEOC are treated as related party transactions for Caesars Entertainment. These transactions include items such as casino management fees paid to CEOC, insurance expenses related to insurance coverage provided to CEOC by Caesars Entertainment, and rent payments by CEOC to CERP under the Octavius Tower lease agreement. See   Note 16   for additional information on related party transactions and on the carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that relate to our variable interest in CEOC. 
   
  Note 3       Litigation 
  Litigation  
  Noteholder Disputes 
  On   August 4, 2014  ,   Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, solely in its capacity as successor Indenture Trustee for the 10.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the  10.00% Second-Priority Notes ), on behalf of itself and, it alleges, derivatively on behalf of CEOC  , filed a lawsuit (the  Delaware Second Lien Lawsuit ) in   the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware   against   CEC and CEOC, CGP, CAC,CERP, CES, Eric Hession, Gary Loveman, Jeffrey D. Benjamin, David Bonderman, Kelvin L. Davis, Marc C. Rowan, David B. Sambur, and Eric Press  .   The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of contract, intentional and constructive fraudulent transfer, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and corporate waste.     The lawsuit seeks (1) an award of money damages; (2) to void certain transfers, the earliest of which dates back to 2010; (3) an injunction directing the recipients of the assets in these transactions to return them to CEOC; (4) a declaration that CEC remains liable under the parent guarantee formerly applicable to the 10.00% Second-Priority Notes; (5) to impose a constructive trust or equitable lien on the transferred assets; and (6) an award to plaintiffs for their attorneys  fees and costs.     CEC believes this lawsuit is without merit and is defending itself vigorously.     A motion to dismiss this action was filed by CEC and other defendants in September 2014,  
  
    14 

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

and the motion was argued in December 2014.     During the pendency of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the action has been automatically stayed with respect to CEOC. The motion to dismiss with respect to CEC was denied on March 18, 2015. In a Verified Supplemental Complaint filed on August 3, 2015, the plaintiff stated that due to CEOC s bankruptcy filing, the continuation of all claims was stayed pursuant to the bankruptcy except for Claims II, III, and X. These are claims against CEC only, for breach of contract in respect of the release of the parent guarantee formerly applicable to the CEOC 10.00% Second-Priority Notes, for declaratory relief in respect of the release of this guarantee, and for violations of the Trust Indenture Act in respect of the release of this guarantee. Fact discovery in the case is complete, and cross-motions for summary judgment have been filed by the parties. On October 5, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court granted CEOC s motion for a stay of this proceeding (and others). The stay will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the first omnibus hearing after the Bankruptcy Court issues its decision confirming or denying confirmation of the Restructuring, (b) the termination of the restructuring support agreement with the Official Committee of Second Priority Noteholders or (c) further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
  On   September 3, 2014  ,   holders of approximately $21 million of CEOC 6.50% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2016 and 5.75% Senior Unsecured Noted due 2017 (collectively, the  Senior Unsecured Notes )   filed suit in   federal district court in Manhattan   against   CEC and CEOC  ,   claiming broadly that an August 12, 2014 Note Purchase and Support Agreement between CEC and CEOC (on the one hand) and certain other holders of the Senior Unsecured Notes (on the other hand) impaired their own rights under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the indentures governing the Senior Unsecured Notes. The lawsuit seeks both declaratory and monetary relief. On October 2, 2014, a holder of CEOC s 6.50% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2016 purporting to represent a class of all persons who held these Notes from August 11, 2014 to the present filed a substantially similar suit in the same court, against the same defendants, relating to the same transactions.     Both lawsuits (the  Senior Unsecured Lawsuits ) were assigned to the same judge. The claims against CEOC have been automatically stayed during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The court denied a motion to dismiss both lawsuits with respect to CEC. The parties have completed fact discovery with respect to both plaintiffs' claims against CEC. On October 23, 2015, plaintiffs in the Senior Unsecured Lawsuits moved for partial summary judgment, and on December 29, 2015, those motions were denied. On December 4, 2015, plaintiff in the action brought on behalf of holders of CEOC s 6.50% Senior Unsecured Notes moved for class certification and briefing has been completed. The judge presiding over these cases thereafter retired, and a new judge was appointed to preside over these lawsuits. That judge set a new summary judgment briefing schedule, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which remain pending. On October 5, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court granted CEOC s motion for a stay of these proceedings (and others). The stay will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the first omnibus hearing after the Bankruptcy Court issues its decision confirming or denying confirmation of the Restructuring, (b) the termination of the restructuring support agreement with the Official Committee of Second Priority Noteholders or (c) further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
  On   November 25, 2014  ,   UMB Bank ( UMB ), as successor indenture trustee for CEOC's 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  8.50% Senior Secured Notes )  , filed a verified complaint (the  Delaware First Lien Lawsuit ) in   Delaware Chancery Court   against   CEC, CEOC, CERP, CAC, CGP, CES, and against individual past and present Board members Loveman, Benjamin, Bonderman, Davis, Press, Rowan, Sambur, Hession, Colvin, Kleisner, Swann, Williams, Housenbold, Cohen, Stauber, and Winograd  ,   alleging generally that defendants improperly stripped CEOC of certain assets, wrongfully effected a release of CEC s parent guarantee of the 8.50% Senior Secured Notes and committed other wrongs.     Among other things, UMB asked the court to appoint a receiver over CEOC. In addition, the suit pleads claims for fraudulent conveyances/transfers, insider preferences, illegal dividends, declaratory judgment (for breach of contract as regards to the parent guarantee and also as to certain covenants in the bond indenture), tortious interference with contract, breach of fiduciary duty, usurpation of corporate opportunities, and unjust enrichment, and seeks monetary, equitable and declaratory relief.     The lawsuit has been automatically stayed with respect to CEOC during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. Pursuant to the First Lien Bond RSA, the lawsuit also has been stayed in its entirety, with the consent of all of the parties to it. 
  On February 13, 2015, Caesars Entertainment received a Demand For Payment of Guaranteed Obligations (the  February 13 Notice ) from Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, in its capacity as successor Trustee for CEOC s 10.00% Second-Priority Notes. The February 13 Notice alleges that CEOC s commencement of its voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy case constituted an event of default under the indenture governing the 10.00% Second-Priority Notes; that all amounts due and owing on the 10.00% Second-Priority Notes therefore immediately became payable; and that Caesars Entertainment is responsible for paying CEOC s obligations on the 10.00% Second-Priority Notes, including CEOC s obligation to timely pay all principal, interest, and any premium due on these notes, as a result of a parent guarantee provision contained in the indenture governing the notes that the February 13 Notice alleges is still binding. The February 13 Notice accordingly demands that Caesars Entertainment immediately pay Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, cash in an amount of not less than $3.7 billion, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including without limitation the $184 million interest payment due December 15, 2014 that CEOC elected not to pay) and accrued  
  
    15 

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

and unpaid attorneys  fees and other expenses. The February 13 Notice also alleges that the interest, fees and expenses continue to accrue. 
  On February 18, 2015, Caesars Entertainment received a Demand For Payment of Guaranteed Obligations (the  February 18 Notice ) from BOKF, N.A. ( BOKF ), in its capacity as successor Trustee for CEOC s 12.75% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the  12.75% Second-Priority Notes ). The February 18 Notice alleges that CEOC s commencement of its voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy case constituted an event of default under the indenture governing the 12.75% Second-Priority Notes; that all amounts due and owing on the 12.75% Second-Priority Notes therefore immediately became payable; and that CEC is responsible for paying CEOC s obligations on the 12.75% Second-Priority Notes, including CEOC s obligation to timely pay all principal, interest and any premium due on these notes, as a result of a parent guarantee provision contained in the indenture governing the notes that the February 18 Notice alleges is still binding. The February 18 Notice therefore demands that CEC immediately pay BOKF cash in an amount of not less than $750 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, accrued and unpaid attorneys  fees, and other expenses. The February 18 Notice also alleges that the interest, fees and expenses continue to accrue. 
  In accordance with the terms of the applicable indentures, CEC is not subject to the above-described guarantees. As a result, we believe the demands for payment are meritless. 
  On March 3, 2015, BOKF filed a lawsuit (the  New York Second Lien Lawsuit ) against CEC in federal district court in Manhattan, in its capacity as successor trustee for CEOC s 12.75% Second-Priority Notes. On June 15, 2015, UMB filed a lawsuit (the  New York First Lien Lawsuit ) against CEC, also in federal district court in Manhattan, in its capacity as successor trustee for CEOC s 11.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2017, 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020, and 9.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2020. Plaintiffs in these actions allege that CEOC s filing of its voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy case constitutes an event of default under the indentures governing these notes, causing all principal and interest to become immediately due and payable, and that CEC is obligated to make those payments pursuant to parent guarantee provisions in the indentures governing these notes that plaintiffs allege are still binding. Both plaintiffs bring claims for violation of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing and for declaratory relief and BOKF brings an additional claim for intentional interference with contractual relations. The cases were both assigned to the same judge presiding over the other Parent Guarantee Lawsuits (as defined below) that are taking place in Manhattan. CEC filed its answer to the BOKF complaint on March 25, 2015, and to the UMB complaint on August 10, 2015. On June 25, 2015, and June 26, 2015, BOKF and UMB, respectively, moved for partial summary judgment, specifically on their claims alleging a violation of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, seeking both declaratory relief and damages. On August 27, 2015, those motions were denied. The court, on its own motion, certified its order with respect to the interpretation of the Trust Indenture Act for interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and on December 22, 2015, the appellate court denied our motion for leave to appeal. On November 20, 2015, BOKF and UMB again moved for partial summary judgment. These motions likewise were denied. The judge presiding over these cases thereafter retired, and a new judge was appointed to preside over these lawsuits. That judge set a new summary judgment briefing schedule, and the parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment, which remain pending. On October 5, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court granted CEOC s motion for a stay of the New York First Lien Lawsuit and the New York Second Lien Lawsuit (and others). The stay will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the first omnibus hearing after the Bankruptcy Court issues its decision confirming or denying confirmation of the Restructuring, (b) the termination of the restructuring support agreement with the Official Committee of Second Priority Noteholders or (c) further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
  On October 20, 2015, Wilmington Trust, National Association ( Wilmington Trust ), filed a lawsuit (the  New York Senior Notes Lawsuit  and, together with the Delaware Second Lien Lawsuit, the Delaware First Lien Lawsuit, the Senior Unsecured Lawsuits, the New York Second Lien Lawsuit, and the New York First Lien Lawsuit, the  Parent Guarantee Lawsuits ) against CEC in federal district court in Manhattan in its capacity as successor indenture trustee for CEOC s 10.75% Senior Notes due 2016 (the  10.75% Senior Notes ). Plaintiff alleges that CEC is obligated to make payment of amounts due on the 10.75% Senior Notes pursuant to a parent guarantee provision in the indenture governing those notes that plaintiff alleges is still in effect. Plaintiff raises claims for violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and for declaratory judgment, and seeks monetary and declaratory relief. CEC filed its answer to the complaint on November 23, 2015. As with the other parent guaranty lawsuits taking place in Manhattan, the judge presiding over these cases thereafter retired, and a new judge was appointed to preside over these lawsuits. That judge set a new summary judgment briefing schedule, and the parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment, which remain pending. On October 5, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court granted CEOC s motion for a stay of this proceeding (and others). The stay will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the first omnibus hearing after the Bankruptcy Court issues its decision confirming or denying confirmation of the

Restructuring, (b) the termination of the restructuring support agreement with the Official Committee of Second Priority Noteholders or (c) further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
  We believe that the claims and demands described above against CEC are without merit and we intend to defend the Company vigorously. The claims against CEOC have been stayed due to the Chapter 11 process and, as described above, the actions against CEC have also been stayed. See additional disclosure relating to CEOC s Chapter 11 filing in Note 1. Should they ever proceed, we believe that the Noteholder Disputes and the Parent Guarantee Lawsuits have a reasonably possible likelihood of an adverse outcome. Should these matters ultimately be resolved through litigation outside of the Restructuring, and should a court find in favor of the claimants in some or all of the Noteholder Disputes, such determination would likely lead to a CEC reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (see Note 1). We are not able to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses should any of the Noteholder Disputes ultimately be resolved against us, although they could potentially exceed $11 billion. 
  CEC-CAC Merger Litigation 
  On   December 30, 2014  ,   Nicholas Koskie, on behalf of himself and, he alleges, all others similarly situated  , filed a lawsuit (the  Merger Lawsuit ) in   the Clark County District Court in the State of Nevada   (the  Court ) against   CAC, CEC and members of the CAC board of directors Marc Beilinson, Philip Erlanger, Dhiren Fonseca, Don Kornstein, Karl Peterson, Marc Rowan, and David Sambur (the individual defendants collectively, the  CAC Directors )  .   The Merger Lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the CAC Directors and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against CAC and CEC.   It seeks (1) an order directing the CAC Directors to fulfill alleged fiduciary duties to CAC in connection with the proposed merger between CAC and CEC announced on December 22, 2014, specifically by announcing their intention to (a) cooperate with bona fide interested parties proposing alternative transactions, (b) ensure that no conflicts exist between the CAC Directors  personal interests and their fiduciary duties to maximize shareholder value in the Merger, or resolve all such conflicts in favor of the latter, and (c) act independently to protect the interests of the shareholders; (2) an order directing the CAC Directors to account for all damages suffered or to be suffered by plaintiff and the putative class as a result of the Merger; and (3) an award to plaintiff for his costs and attorneys  fees.   On October 13, 2016, the Court dismissed the case for lack of prosecution.   Pursuant to local rule, the case may be reinstated at the plaintiff s written request, provided such request is filed within 30 days of the date of service of written notice of the dismissal. 
  Employee Benefit Obligations 
  In December 1998, Hilton Hotels Corporation ( Hilton ) spun-off its gaming operations as Park Place Entertainment Corporation ( Park Place ). In connection with the spin-off, Hilton and Park Place entered into various agreements, including an Employee Benefits and Other Employment Allocation Agreement dated December 31, 1998 (the  Allocation Agreement ) whereby Park Place assumed or retained, as applicable, certain liabilities and excess assets, if any, related to the Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan (the  Hilton Plan ) based on the benefits of Hilton employees and Park Place employees. CEOC is the ultimate successor to Park Place under this Allocation Agreement. In 2013, a lawsuit was settled relating to the Hilton Plan, which retroactively and prospectively increased total benefits to be paid under the Hilton Plan. In 2009, we received a letter from Hilton, notifying us of a lawsuit related to the Hilton Plan that alleged that CEC had a potential liability for the additional claims under the terms of the Allocation Agreement. 
  On December 24, 2014, Hilton, the Plan Administrator of the Hilton Plan, and a representative of the Plan Administrator (the  Hilton Parties ) sued CEC and CEOC in federal court in Virginia primarily under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), and also under state contract and unjust enrichment law theories, for monetary and equitable relief in connection with this ongoing dispute. On April 14, 2015, the federal court dismissed the Hilton Parties  unjust enrichment claim with prejudice and ordered that the remainder of the case be transferred to the Bankruptcy Court based upon its relationship to the CEOC bankruptcy case. 
  On June 9, 2016, CEC, CEOC and the Hilton Parties entered into a settlement of the Hilton Parties  claims (the  Settlement Agreement ). Under the settlement, Hilton will receive a general unsecured claim in CEOC s bankruptcy case for an amount equal to   $51 million   plus 31.75% for amounts paid by Hilton to the Hilton Plan due after July 16, 2016. For periods following the effective date of CEOC s plan of reorganization, CEC shall assume certain of CEOC s obligations under the Allocation Agreement. In exchange, Hilton shall turn over to CEC the distributions on account of   $24.5 million   of Hilton s claim in the CEOC bankruptcy. On June 21, 2016, the parties sought approval of the Settlement Agreement. The CEOC Bankruptcy Court approved the Settlement Agreement on July 19, 2016. The settlement amount is fully accrued in liabilities subject to compromise at CEOC, and the Settlement Agreement is subject to the effectiveness of CEOC s plan of reorganization.

National Retirement Fund 
  In January 2015, a majority of the Trustees of the National Retirement Fund ( NRF ), a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan, voted to expel the five indirect subsidiaries of CEC which were required to make contributions to the legacy plan of the NRF (the  Five Employers ). The NRF contended that the financial condition of the Five Employers  controlled group (the  CEC Controlled Group ) and CEOC s then-potential bankruptcy presented an  actuarial risk  to the plan because, depending on the outcome of any CEOC bankruptcy proceedings, CEC might no longer be liable to the plan for any partial or complete withdrawal liability. As a result, the NRF claimed that the expulsion of the Five Employers constituted a complete withdrawal of the CEC Controlled Group from the plan. CEOC, in its bankruptcy proceedings, has to date not rejected the contribution obligations to the NRF of any of its subsidiary employers. The NRF has advised the CEC Controlled Group (which includes CERP) that the expulsion of the Five Employers has triggered a joint and several withdrawal liability with a present value of approximately $360 million, payable in 80 quarterly payments of about $6 million. 
  Prior to the NRF s vote to expel the Five Employers, the Five Employers reiterated their commitments to remain in the plan and not seek rejection of any collective bargaining agreement in which the obligation to contribute to NRF exists. The Five Employers were current with respect to pension contributions at the time of their expulsion, and are current with respect to pension contributions as of today pursuant to the Standstill Agreement referred to below. 
  We have opposed the various NRF expulsion actions. 
  On January 8, 2015, prior to the NRF s vote to expel the Five Employers, CEC filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  S.D.N.Y. ) against the NRF and its Board of Trustees, seeking a declaratory judgment that they did not have the authority to expel the Five Employers and thus allegedly trigger withdrawal liability for the CEC Controlled Group (the  CEC Action ). On December 25, 2015, the District Judge entered an order dismissing the CEC Action on the ground that CEC s claims in this action must first be arbitrated under ERISA. CEC has appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
  On March 6 and March 27, 2015, CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries filed in the CEOC bankruptcy proceedings two motions to void (a) the purported expulsion of the Five Employers and based thereon the alleged triggering of withdrawal liability for the non-debtor members of the CEC Controlled Group, and (b) a notice and payment demand for quarterly payments of withdrawal liability subsequently made by the NRF to certain non-debtor members of the CEC Controlled Group, respectively, on the ground that each of these actions violated the automatic stay (the  362 Motions ). On November 12, 2015, Bankruptcy Judge Goldgar issued a decision denying the 362 Motions on the ground that the NRF s actions were directed at non-debtors and therefore did not violate the automatic stay. CEOC has appealed this decision to the federal district court in Chicago. 
  On March 6, 2015, CEOC commenced an adversary proceeding against the NRF and its Board of Trustees in the Bankruptcy Court (the  Adversary Proceeding ). On March 11, 2015, CEOC filed a motion in that Adversary Proceeding to extend the automatic stay in the CEOC bankruptcy proceedings to apply to the NRF s expulsion of the Five Employers (the  105 Motion ). Judge Goldgar has not yet decided the 105 Motion. 
  On March 20, 2015, CEC, CEOC and CERP, on behalf of themselves and others, entered into a Standstill Agreement with the NRF and its Board of Trustees that, among other things, stayed each member of the CEC Controlled Group s purported obligation to commence making quarterly payments of withdrawal liability and instead required the Five Employers to continue making monthly contribution payments to the NRF, unless and until each of the 362 Motions and the 105 Motion had been denied. As the 105 Motion has not yet been decided, the Standstill Agreement remains in effect. 
  If both the 105 Motion and CEC s appeal of the CEC Action are denied, then CEC could be required to pay to the NRF joint and several withdrawal liability with a present value of approximately $360 million, payable in 80 quarterly payments of about $6 million each while CEC simultaneously arbitrates whether the NRF and its Board of Trustees had the authority to expel the Five Employers and trigger withdrawal liability for the CEC Controlled Group. 
  Also, on March 18, 2015, the NRF and its fund manager commenced a collection action in the S.D.N.Y. against CEC, CERP and all non-debtor members of the CEC Controlled Group for the payment of the first quarterly payment of withdrawal liability, which the NRF contended was due on March 15, 2015 (the  NRF Action ). On December 25, 2015, the District Judge denied the defendants  motion to dismiss the NRF Action on the ground that the arguments raised by the defendants must first be arbitrated under ERISA. On February 26, 2016, the NRF and its fund manager filed a motion for summary judgment against CEC and CERP

  (UNAUDITED) 

for payment of the first quarterly payment of withdrawal liability and for interest, liquidated damages, attorneys  fees and costs. On May 5, 2016, the Magistrate Judge recommended in his report and recommendation ( Report and Recommendation ) that the NRF Action plaintiffs  motion for summary judgment be granted on the ground that the further arguments raised by CEC and CERP must first be arbitrated under ERISA. On May 19, 2016, CEC and CERP filed their objections to the Report and Recommendation (the  Objections ). On June 2, 2016, the NRF Action plaintiffs filed their response to the Objections.   The District Judge has not yet ruled on the Objections. If the District Judge adopts the Magistrate Judge s Report and Recommendation, then a judgment could be entered against CEC and CERP for approximately   $8 million   comprising the first quarterly payment of withdrawal liability referred to above, interest and liquidated damages under ERISA, which amount would be paid or bonded pending an appeal. 
  We believe our legal arguments against the actions undertaken by NRF are strong and will pursue them vigorously, and will defend vigorously against the claims raised by the NRF in the NRF Action. Since settlement discussions with the NRF are continuing and no material discovery has yet been performed with respect to any of the above actions, we cannot currently provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the matters at issue. 
  Other Matters 
  In recent years, governmental authorities have been increasingly focused on anti-money laundering ( AML ) policies and procedures, with a particular focus on the gaming industry. In October 2013, CEOC s subsidiary, Desert Palace, Inc. (the owner of and referred to herein as Caesars Palace), received a letter from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury ( FinCEN ), stating that FinCEN was investigating Caesars Palace for alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act to determine whether it is appropriate to assess a civil penalty and/or take additional enforcement action against Caesars Palace. Caesars Palace responded to FinCEN s letter in January 2014. Additionally, we were informed in October 2013 that a federal grand jury investigation regarding anti-money laundering practices of the Company and its subsidiaries had been initiated. CEC and Caesars Palace have been cooperating with FinCEN, the Department of Justice and the Nevada Gaming Control Board (the  GCB ) on this matter. On September 8, 2015, FinCEN announced a settlement pursuant to which Caesars Palace agreed to an $8 million civil penalty for its violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, which penalty shall be treated as a general unsecured claim in Caesars Palace s bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, Caesars Palace agreed to conduct periodic external audits and independent testing of its AML compliance program, report to FinCEN on mandated improvements, adopt a rigorous training regime, and engage in a  look-back  for suspicious transactions. The terms of the FinCEN settlement were approved by the Bankruptcy Court on October 19, 2015. 
  CEOC and the GCB reached a settlement on the same facts as above, wherein CEC agreed to pay $1.5 million and provide to the GCB the same information that is reported to FinCEN and to resubmit its updated AML policies. On September 17, 2015, the settlement agreement was approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission.     CEOC continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice in its investigation of this matter. 
  Caesars is party to other ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business. We do not expect the outcome of any such litigation to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as we do not believe it is reasonably possible that we will incur material losses as a result of such litigation. 
   
  Note 4       Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  During 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis     (see   Note 2  ) and ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (see   Note 12  ). 
  The FASB issued the following authoritative guidance amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. 
  New Developments 
  Statement of Cash Flows - August 2016  :   Amended guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

  (UNAUDITED) 

Income Taxes - October 2016  :   Amended guidance addresses intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which requires the recognition of any related income tax consequences when such transfers occur. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.    
  Consolidation - October 2016  :   Amended consolidation guidance addresses how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and including interim periods within those fiscal years. During 2016 we adopted ASU No. 2015-2 and are required to apply updated amendments retrospectively to all relevant prior periods beginning with the fiscal year in which amendments in ASU No. 2015-2 were applied. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 
  Previously Disclosed 
  Revenue Recognition - May 2014 (amended May 2016)  :   Created a new Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The new guidance is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for United States GAAP applicable to revenue transactions. This guidance provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Existing industry guidance will be eliminated, including revenue recognition guidance specific to the gaming industry. In addition, interim and annual disclosures will be substantially revised. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We currently anticipate adopting this standard effective January 1, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements; however, we expect that the accounting for the Total Rewards customer loyalty program and casino promotional allowances will be affected. 
  Going Concern - August 2014  :   Amended the existing requirements for disclosing information about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. This guidance explicitly requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have any effect on our financial statements, as we have concluded that we have substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, irrespective of the new requirements. 
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments - January 2016  :   Amended certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other things, they require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income and simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted on certain provisions. We are currently assessing the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 
  Leases - February 2016  :   The new guidance requires lease obligations to be recognized on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance should be implemented for the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach which includes optional practical expedients primarily focused on leases that commenced before the effective date, including continuing to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous guidance, unless the lease is modified. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

Financial Instruments-Credit Losses - June 2016  :   Amended guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. Amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

Restructuring Commitments 

As described in   Note 1  , we recognized certain obligations that we believe will ultimately be settled under the Third Amended Plan or the RSAs. A portion of the obligations we recognized reflect our estimates of the fair value of the consideration CEC has agreed to provide in the form of CEC equity and convertible notes in exchange for the settlement of litigation claims and potential claims against CEC and its affiliates. These obligations are recorded in accrued restructuring and support expenses on the Balance Sheets and will be accounted for at fair value each period until they are ultimately settled as part of the Restructuring. 
  Valuation Methodologies 
  CEC Convertible Notes   - We estimated the fair value of the CEC convertible notes to be issued using a binomial lattice valuation model that incorporates the value of both the debt and conversion features of the notes. In the Third Amended Plan, the terms of the convertible notes were revised, and the notes currently have a face value of   $1.1 billion  , a term of   7   years, a coupon rate of   5%  , and are convertible into   13.714%   of fully-diluted CEC equity. The valuation model incorporates assumptions regarding the incremental cost of borrowing for CEC, the value of CEC s equity into which these notes could convert, the implied volatility of such equity, and the risk-free rate. The increase in the fair value primarily resulted from the removal of restrictions on the conversion features, the increase in the conversion ratio, and the increase in the face value of the convertible notes in the Third Amended Plan. 
  Key Assumptions -  
             
    Incremental cost of borrowing -   5.0% 
       Should CEC s estimated incremental cost of borrowing or equity value fluctuate over time, it could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes and the corresponding restructuring accrual. A hypothetical decrease in the incremental borrowing rate of 1.0% would result in a $40 million increase in the restructuring accrual. Similarly, a hypothetical 5.0% increase in the implied volatility of CEC s equity would result in an increase to the restructuring accrual of $30 million. Since the key assumptions used in the valuation model, including CEC s current estimated incremental cost of borrowing and the implied volatility of CEC s equity, are significant unobservable inputs, the fair value for the convertible notes is classified as Level 3. 
  CEC Common Stock   - CEC will issue CEC common shares for the settlement of claims and potential claims and is obligated to repurchase at least   $1.0 billion   worth of the issued shares at a fixed price. The value of the purchase obligation is not subject to change; therefore, the estimated fair value primarily represents the net shares that we expect to issue after satisfying the repurchase obligation. We have used the fair value of CEC s common stock to estimate this portion of the restructuring accrual. 
  
    23 

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

The CEC common equity value is subject to market fluctuations and does not necessarily reflect the final value of completing the transactions contemplated in the Third Amended Plan and the related RSAs. The valuation models used to estimate the fair value of CEC s common stock expected to be issued do not require significant judgment and inputs can be observed in a liquid market, such as the current trading price of CEC common stock. However, the valuation model includes inputs other than quoted prices in active markets, such as adjustments related to the dilutive effects of other transactions, including equity issuances in connection with the Restructuring and the Merger; therefore, this portion of the restructuring accrual is classified as Level 2. 
  Additionally, we have accrued a liability of   $29 million   for the fair value associated with the creditors  right to require CEC to repurchase up to   $200 million   worth of the newly-issued CEC common shares. We determined the estimate fair value of this potential obligation using the Black-Scholes Option Valuation Model, which incorporates assumptions regarding the value of CEC s equity, implied volatility of CEC common equity, and the risk-free rate. 
  Key Assumptions -  
             
    Historical volatility -   80% 
      Should CEC s equity value fluctuate over time, it could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the repurchase obligation and the corresponding restructuring accrual. A hypothetical 5.0% increase in the historical volatility of CEC s equity would result in an increase to the restructuring accrual of $2 million. Since the historical volatility of CEC s equity is a significant unobservable input, the fair value for the convertible notes is classified as Level 3. 
  Derivative Instruments 
  CEOC had   eight   interest rate swap agreements that expired, which we settled for   $17 million   during the first quarter of 2015. Interest expense related to the derivatives was   $7 million   in the first quarter of 2015. We have not entered into any additional derivative transactions since these swaps expired. 
   
  Note 8       Contractual Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  Contractual Commitments 
  Except as described in   Note 1  , during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we have not entered into any material contractual commitments outside of the ordinary course of business that have materially changed our contractual commitments as compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
  Contingent Liabilities 
  Self-Insurance 
  We are self-insured for workers compensation and other risk insurance with a total estimated self-insurance liability of   $157 million   and   $168 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and estimated employee medical insurance claims of   $15 million   have been funded through CEOC as of   September 30, 2016  . CEOC was deconsolidated effective January 15, 2015; therefore no amounts are reported for CEOC as of December 31, 2015. 
  Deferred Compensation and Employee Benefits 
  Deferred Compensation Plans 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , certain current and former employees of Caesars, and our subsidiaries and affiliates, have balances under the Harrah s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan ( ESSP ), the Harrah s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan II ( ESSP II ), the Park Place Entertainment Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ( CEDCP ), the Harrah s Entertainment, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan ( DCP ), and the Harrah s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ( EDCP ). These plans are deferred compensation plans that allow certain employees an opportunity to save for retirement and other purposes. 
  Each of the plans is now frozen and is no longer accepting contributions. However, participants may still earn returns on existing plan balances based upon their selected investment alternatives, which are reflected in their deferral accounts.

Plan obligations in respect of all of these plans were included in Caesars  financial statements as liabilities prior to the deconsolidation of CEOC. Caesars has recorded in the accompanying financial statements   $42 million   and   $44 million   in liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, representing the estimate of its obligations under the ESSP and ESSP II and for certain former directors and employees who had employment agreements with Harrah s Entertainment, Inc. (the predecessor to CEC) and participated in the EDCP. The additional liability in respect of the CEDCP and DCP that Caesars has not recorded was approximately   $31 million   and   $29 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as we determined that this portion of the liability was attributable to CEOC pending the effectiveness of the settlement described below. 
  Trust Assets 
  CEC is a party to a trust agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) and an escrow agreement (the  Escrow Agreement ), each structured as so-called  rabbi trust  arrangements, which hold assets that may be used to satisfy obligations under the deferred compensation plans above. Amounts held pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Escrow Agreement were approximately   $65 million   and   $57 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $64 million   and   $49 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  The assets held pursuant to the Trust Agreement have been reflected as long-term restricted assets on the Balance Sheets. The assets held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement were not reflected on the Balance Sheets as we continued to assess the Escrow Agreement and the propriety of the funds that were contributed in accordance with the agreement prior to reaching the settlement described below, which was not yet effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Settlement Agreement 
  On September 14, 2016, CEC entered into a settlement agreement with CEOC related to the liabilities and assets associated with the above deferred compensation plans, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on October 17, 2016. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, contemporaneously with the Effective Date of the Restructuring, CEC will assume all obligations to plan participants under or with respect to all five of the deferred compensation plans, and the Debtors will have no further obligations to the deferred compensation plan participants. At that time, CEOC and the other Debtors will relinquish and release any claim or right that any of them may have in respect of the assets held under either the Trust Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of the Restructuring and CEC s receipt of the assets held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, CEC will record the additional assets and liabilities in respect of the CEDCP and DCP and Escrow Agreement, which are   $57 million   and   $31 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  .

Although there are   no   outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facilities for CERP or CGPH as of   September 30, 2016  , borrowings under these revolving credit facilities are each subject to separate note agreements executed based on the provisions of the applicable credit facility agreements, and each note has a contractual maturity of less than one year. The applicable credit facility agreements each have a contractual maturity of greater than one year, and we have the ability to rollover the outstanding principal balances on a long-term basis. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facilities are intended to satisfy short term liquidity needs and are classified as current. 
  Fair Value 
  We estimated the fair value of debt based on borrowing rates available as of   September 30, 2016   for debt with similar terms and maturities, and based on market quotes of our publicly traded debt. We classify the fair value of debt within level 1 and level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 12       Stock-Based Compensation 
  Caesars Entertainment Stock-Based Compensation 
  During the second quarter 2016, we implemented the FASB s ASU No. 2016-09, which amended Topic 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  . This updated guidance amended the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. We applied the amended guidance using a modified retrospective transition method of a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning equity of   $1 million  . 
  We maintain long-term incentive plans for management, other personnel, and key service providers. The plans allow for granting stock-based compensation awards, based on CEC common stock (NASDAQ symbol  CZR ), including time-based and performance-based stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, stock grants, or a combination of awards. 

CIE Stock-Based Compensation 
  Historically, CIE has granted stock-based compensation awards in CIE common stock to its employees, directors, service providers and consultants in accordance with the Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. Amended and Restated Management Equity Incentive Plan, which was intended to promote the interests of CIE and its shareholders by providing key employees, directors, service providers and consultants with an incentive to encourage their continued employment or service and improve the growth and profitability of CIE. These awards were classified as liability-based instruments and were re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. 
  As described in   Note 1  , in September 2016, CIE sold its SMG Business, which represented the majority of CIE s operations, and the SMG Business is now presented as a discontinued operation (see   Note 14  ). Upon the closing of the SMG Business sale, all outstanding CIE stock-based compensation awards were deemed fully vested and were subsequently paid in cash in connection with the closing of the SMG Business sale, as described in   Note 14  . There was   no   liability related to CIE s stock-based compensation awards as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   December 31, 2015  , the liability related to CIE s stock-based compensation awards was   $107 million  , which was reported within deferred credits and other liabilities on the Balance Sheets. 
  As shown in the table below, the portion of CIE s stock-based compensation expense directly identifiable with employees of the SMG Business was reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Statements of Operations. The portion of CIE s stock-based compensation expense not directly identifiable with employees of the SMG Business was included in property, general, administrative, and other in the Statements of Operations. For both the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,

the majority of stock-based compensation expense resulted from the acceleration of the vesting of CIE stock-based compensation awards.

Note 13       Income Taxes 
  Caesars  provision for income taxes during the interim reporting periods has historically been calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to  ordinary  income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. We utilized a discrete effective tax rate method, as allowed by ASC 740-270    Income Taxes, Interim Reporting,    to calculate taxes for the     three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We determined that as small changes in estimated  ordinary  income would result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate, the historical method would not provide a reliable estimate for the     three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 

We classify reserves for tax uncertainties within accrued expenses and deferred credits and other in the Balance Sheets, separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes. Reserve amounts relate to any potential income tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions and potential interest or penalties associated with those liabilities. 
  Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. We have provided a valuation allowance on certain federal and state deferred tax assets that were not deemed realizable based upon estimates of future taxable income. 
  The effective tax rates related to the loss from continuing operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , differed from the expected federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to losses from continuing operations not tax benefitted. The effective tax rate benefit related to the income from continuing operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , differed from the expected federal tax benefit of 35% primarily due to the nontaxable portion of the gain on deconsolidation of CEOC. 
  The amounts recorded as tax assets, tax liabilities, tax reserves and tax provision reflect CEC s conclusion that certain challenged transactions identified in Note 1 were negotiated in good faith and the Caesars tax consolidated group received fair value for assets transferred. These amounts could change if litigation and potential claims related to the challenged transactions are resolved unfavorably. If that occurs, changes may be necessary to reduce tax assets and increase tax liabilities, tax reserves and the tax provision recorded in CEC s financial statements. Such changes could be material. Management cannot predict the various potential outcomes of pending litigation and other potential claims, thus cannot estimate the reasonably possible amount or range of effects, if any, to the recorded tax accounts. 
  We file income tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. We are under regular and recurring audit by the Internal Revenue Service on open tax positions, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 12 months. 
   
  Note 14       Discontinued Operations 
  Sale of SMG Business 
  On September 23, 2016, CIE sold its SMG Business to Alpha Frontier Limited ( Alpha Frontier ) for cash consideration of   $4.4 billion  , subject to customary purchase price adjustments, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of July 30, 2016 (the "Purchase Agreement"), which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $4.2 billion  . As a result, CAC incurred estimated current income tax expense of approximately   $278 million   on the gain. Under the terms of its operating agreement, CGP is required  
  
    33 

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

to distribute   $278 million   to CAC, which CAC will use to pay its tax obligation resulting from the sale of the SMG Business (see   Note 16  ). Additionally,   $264 million   was deposited into an escrow account to fund potential indemnity claims of Alpha Frontier under the Purchase Agreement (the "Indemnity Escrow"). 
  As discussed in   Note 2  , the majority of the proceeds from the sale of the SMG Business is restricted under the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the CIE Proceeds Agreement and is therefore classified as restricted cash on the Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . As a result of the sale, the results of operations and cash flows related to the SMG Business were classified as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and the historical results have been recast as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The related assets and liabilities have been recast as held for sale as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  In connection with the closing of the SMG Business sale ( Closing ), CIE completed the following transactions, which were funded from the proceeds of the sale: 
             
    Repurchased all of the shares of CIE common stock held by Rock Gaming Interactive LLC, and its other minority investors (collectively, the "Minority Investors") in exchange for the right to receive cash payments representing the fair market value of the shares of CIE common stock at Closing. 
                
    Accelerated the vesting of all of the outstanding options, restricted stock units and warrants of CIE (collectively, "CIE equity awards") and canceled all such CIE equity awards in exchange for the right to receive cash payments equal to the intrinsic value of such awards. 
     The total amount distributed to the Minority Investors and former holders of CIE equity awards in connection with Closing was approximately   $1.1 billion  , which is subject to any purchase price adjustments pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , CGP accrued approximately   $88 million   as an estimate of the additional amounts due to the Minority Investors and former holders of CIE equity awards for any purchase price adjustments and the release of proceeds held in the Indemnity Escrow. To the extent that there are further purchase price adjustments subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the overall recorded gain on the transaction may be adjusted. 
  The CIE Proceeds to be delivered to the Minority Investors and former holders of CIE equity awards subsequent to any purchase price adjustments and the release of proceeds, if any, from the Indemnity Escrow at the end of the escrow period will be paid to such parties when such amounts are paid to CIE under the Purchase Agreement. 
  Assets and liabilities held for sale in the Balance Sheets are related to the SMG Business. Discontinued operations in 2015 also include properties owned by CEOC, which was deconsolidated effective January 15, 2015 (see   Note 2  ).

  Note 15       Segment Reporting 
  We view each casino property as an operating segment and currently aggregate all such casino properties into   two   reportable segments: CERP and CGP.   Through June 30, 2016, we presented CGP as two separate reportable segments: CGP Casinos and CIE. Subsequent to the sale of the SMG Business (see Note 1) the remaining CIE business is not material. Therefore, we no longer consider CIE to be a separate reportable segment, and CGP Casinos and CIE have been combined for all periods presented as the CGP segment. Additionally, CEOC was a reportable segment until its deconsolidation effective January 15, 2015. 
  The results of each reportable segment presented below are consistent with the way Caesars management assesses these results and allocates resources, which is a consolidated view that adjusts for the impact of certain transactions between reportable segments within Caesars, as described below. Accordingly, the results of certain reportable segments presented in this filing differ from the financial statement information presented in their standalone filings. 
   Other  includes parent, consolidating, and other adjustments to reconcile to consolidated Caesars results.

Property EBITDA - by Segment 
  Property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) is presented as a measure of the Company s performance. Property EBITDA is defined as revenues less property operating expenses and is comprised of net income/(loss) before (i) interest expense, net of interest capitalized and interest income, (ii) income tax (benefit)/provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) corporate expenses, and (v) certain items that we do not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance at an operating property level. As a result of the sale of the SMG Business (see   Note 1  ), we have determined that CIE stock-based compensation expense should be excluded from Property EBITDA as management no longer considers such expense to be indicative of Caesars Entertainment s ongoing consolidated or segment operating performance. Therefore, Property EBITDA has been recast for prior periods to be consistent to the current year presentation. 
  In evaluating Property EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Property EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items. 
  Property EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income/(loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Property EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Property EBITDA is included because management uses Property EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Property EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.

Note 16       Related Party Transactions 

Transactions Related to the CEOC Reorganization 
  The Debtors filed the Third Amended Plan on   October 20, 2016  , and CEC, CAC, the Debtors, and CEOC s major creditor groups have agreed to support the Third Amended Plan and have entered into various RSAs with respect to the CEOC reorganization. See detailed discussion of the Third Amended Plan and the RSAs at   Note 1  . 
  Transactions with Sponsors and their Affiliates 
  The members of Hamlet Holdings LLC ( Hamlet Holdings ) are comprised of individuals affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC and affiliates of TPG Capital LP (collectively, the  Sponsors ). As of   September 30, 2016  , Hamlet Holdings beneficially owned a majority of CEC s common stock pursuant to an irrevocable proxy providing Hamlet Holdings with sole voting and sole dispositive power over those shares, and, as a result, the Sponsors have the power to elect all of CEC s directors. 
  Reimbursements and Expenses 
  CEC has a services agreement with the Sponsors relating to the provision of financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services. The Sponsors have granted an ongoing waiver of the monitoring fees for management services; however, we reimburse the Sponsors for expenses they incur related to these management services and certain legal expenses. The reimbursed expenses are included in corporate expense and are included in the table above.

Sponsors  Portfolio Companies 
  We may engage in transactions with companies owned or controlled by affiliates of the Sponsors in the normal course of business. Amounts paid to the Sponsors  portfolio companies are included in the table above and we believe such transactions are conducted at fair value. 
  In addition, certain entities affiliated with or under the control of our Sponsors may from time to time transact in and hold our debt securities, and participate in any modifications of such instruments on terms available to any other holder of our debt. 
  Caesars Acquisition Company 
  As described in   Note 2  , CAC is the sole voting member of CGP, our consolidated VIE, and common control exists between CAC and Caesars through the majority beneficial ownership of both by Hamlet Holdings. Pursuant to the operating agreement of CGP, CGP pays certain expenses on behalf of CAC. These expenses, which are included in the table above, commenced in 2013 and are reflected as distributions to a noncontrolling interest holder in the consolidated statements of equity. The three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   include   $278 million   related to CAC s estimated current income tax expense on the gain on sale of the SMG Business. Since, under its operating agreement, CGP is required to distribute funds to CAC that will be used to pay CAC s tax obligation resulting from the sale, CGP accrued this amount during the third quarter of 2016 (see   Note 14  ). 
  Transactions with CEOC 
  As described in   Note 2  , upon its filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and its subsequent deconsolidation, transactions with CEOC are no longer eliminated in consolidation and are considered related party transactions for Caesars. A summary of these transactions is provided in the table above. 
  CEOC Shared Services Agreement 
  Pursuant to a shared services agreement, CEOC provides Caesars with certain corporate and administrative services, and the costs of these services are allocated to Caesars. Certain services are now provided by CES (see   Note 1  ). 
  Prior to the deconsolidation of CEOC, we were self-insured for employee medical (health, dental and vision) and risk products, including workers compensation and surety bonds, and our insurance claims and reserves included accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported claims. 
  We continue to be self-insured for workers compensation and other risk insurance as of   September 30, 2016  . Caesars Entertainment provides insurance coverage to CEOC and receives insurance premiums on an installment basis, which are intended to cover claims processed on CEOC s behalf. We prepay CEOC for estimated employee medical insurance claims. 
  Services Joint Venture 
  CES provides certain corporate and administrative services to its Members. The costs of these services are allocated among the Members, which include CEOC, with CERP and CGP being allocated   21.8%   and   12.8%  , respectively. CEOC reimburses CES for the allocated costs. The CES allocated costs include amounts for insurance coverage (see   Note 1  ). 
  Management Fees 
  CGP pays a management fee to CEOC for the CGP properties that are managed by CEOC or CES. 
  Octavius Tower Lease Agreement 
  Under the Octavius Tower lease agreement, CEOC leases the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace from CERP and pays rent totaling   $35 million   annually through expiration in April 2026. 
  LINQ Access and Parking Easement Lease Agreement 
  Under the LINQ Access and Parking Easement lease agreement, CEOC leases the parking lot behind The LINQ promenade and The LINQ Hotel   Casino to CERP and CGP. Together, CERP and CGP pay approximately   $2 million   annually, subject to a 3% annual increase through expiration in April 2028. Amounts are included within other expenses incurred in the table above.

Service Provider Fee 
  CEOC, CERP and CGP have a shared services agreement under which CERP and CGP pay for certain indirect corporate support costs. CEOC is authorized to charge CERP and CGP for an amount equal to   21.8%   and   12.8%  , respectively, of unallocated corporate support costs. Amounts are included within other expenses incurred in the table above. 
  Cross Marketing and Trademark License Agreement 
  CIE and CEOC have a Cross Marketing and Trademark License Agreement in effect until December 31, 2026, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The agreement grants CIE the exclusive right to use various brands of Caesars Entertainment in connection with social and mobile games and online real money gaming in exchange for a   3.0%   royalty. This agreement also provides for cross-marketing and promotional activities between CIE and CEOC, including participation by CIE in Caesars  Total Rewards loyalty program. CEOC also receives a revenue share from CIE for customer referrals. Amounts are included within other expenses incurred in the table above. 
  Effective upon Closing, CIE and Playtika, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of CIE and now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the buyer of the SMG Business, executed a separate sub-license agreement extending substantially the same rights and obligations to both parties beyond the sale through December 31, 2026. 
  Equity Incentive Awards 
  Caesars maintains an equity incentive awards plan under which CEC may issue time-based and performance-based stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards to CEOC employees. Although awards under the plan result in the issuance of shares of CEC, because CEOC is no longer a consolidated subsidiary of CEC, we have accounted for these awards as nonemployee awards subsequent to the date of deconsolidation. 
  Employee Benefit Plans 
  CEC maintains a defined contribution savings and retirement plan in which employees of CEOC may participate. The plan provides for, among other things, pre-tax and after-tax contributions by employees. Under the plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 50% of their eligible earnings (subject to certain IRS and plan limits). In addition, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements receive benefits through the multi-employer pension plans sponsored by the organization in which they are a member. The expenses related to contributions made to the plans on their behalf are allocated to the properties at which they are employed. 
  Total Rewards Loyalty Program 
  CEOC s customer loyalty program, Total Rewards, offers incentives to customers from their spending related to on-property entertainment expenses, including gaming, hotel, dining, and retail shopping at our and CEOC s resort properties located in the U.S. and Canada. Under the program, customers are able to accumulate, or bank, Reward Credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program. The Reward Credit balance will be forfeited if the customer does not earn a Reward Credit over the prior six-month period. As a result of the ability of the customer to bank the Reward Credits, CEOC estimates the cost of fulfilling the redemption of Reward Credits, after consideration of estimated forfeitures (referred to as  breakage ) based upon the cost of historical redemptions. The estimated value of Reward Credits is expensed as the Reward Credits are earned by customers and is included in direct casino expense. The total estimated cost is accrued by CEOC, with the incremental charges related to our casino properties included in due to affiliates, net in the Balance Sheets. 
  Due from/to Affiliates 
  Amounts due to or from affiliates for each counterparty represent the net receivable or payable as of the end of the reporting period primarily resulting from the transactions described above and are settled on a net basis by each counterparty in accordance with the legal and contractual restrictions governing transactions by and among Caesars  consolidated entities and CEOC. The amount due from CEOC represents the maximum exposure to loss as a result of Caesars  involvement with CEOC. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , due from affiliates was   $46 million   and   $34 million  , respectively, and represented a receivable due to CES from CEOC for shared services performed on behalf of CEOC.

  The statements in this discussion regarding our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
           Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
     Overview 
  
  Our business is operated through CEC, which is primarily a holding company with no independent operations of its own, and our   two   reportable segments: 
             
    Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties ( CERP  and 
                
    Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ( CGP ). 
     Through June 30, 2016, we aggregated the operating segments within CGP into two separate reportable segments: Caesars Growth Partners Casino Properties and Developments ( CGP Casinos ) and Caesars Interactive Entertainment ( CIE ). Subsequent to CIE s sale of its social and mobile games business (the  SMG Business ) (see discussion under  Summary of 2016 Events  below), the remaining CIE business is not material, and we no longer consider CIE to be a separate reportable segment from CGP Casinos. Therefore, CGP Casinos and CIE have been combined for all periods presented to form the CGP segment. 
  Summary of 2016 Events 
  
  The following are the significant events that affect our 2016 results. The Discussion of Operating Results should be read in conjunction with this summary. 
  CEC Going Concern 
  As a result of the following circumstances, we have substantial doubt about CEC s ability to continue as a going concern: 
             
    we have limited unrestricted cash available to meet financial commitments of CEC, primarily resulting from significant expenditures made to (1) defend against the litigation matters disclosed below and (2) support a plan of reorganization for CEOC (the  Restructuring  
                
    we have made material future commitments to support the Restructuring described below; and 
                
    we are a defendant in litigation relating to certain CEOC transactions dating back to 2010 and other legal matters (see   Note 3  ) that could result in one or more adverse rulings against us. 
     In connection with the Restructuring and litigation noted above, during 2015 and into 2016, CEC has incurred legal and professional fees and expenses at levels significantly higher than historical amounts. For example, we accrued   $1.0 billion   of restructuring and support expenses during the second half of 2015, of which we paid   $148 million   in the fourth quarter of 2015. We recorded an  
  
    43 

additional   $3.0 billion   during the third quarter of 2016 in deconsolidation and restructuring of CEOC and other in the statement of operations, which increased our total expense for 2016 to   $5.3 billion  . In addition, in 2015, we incurred   $73 million   in legal and professional fees associated with reorganization efforts and ongoing litigation and an additional   $17 million   and   $60 million   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  The circumstances set forth above and described in more detail in   Note 1  , individually and collectively, raise substantial doubt about CEC s ability to continue as a going concern between now and the Effective Date of the Restructuring. CEC does not currently have sufficient cash to meet its financial commitments to support the Restructuring that are due when CEOC ultimately emerges from bankruptcy or to satisfy the potential obligations that would arise in the event of an adverse ruling on one or all of the litigation matters disclosed below. The completion of the merger with CAC is expected to allow CEC to fulfill its financial commitments in support of the Restructuring. However, if the Merger is not completed for any reason, CEC would still be liable for many of these obligations. In addition, although under the terms of the Restructuring, all related litigation is expected to be resolved, the outstanding litigation matters are only stayed pending confirmation of the Restructuring and CEOC s emergence from bankruptcy. 
  The cash forecast at CEC currently contemplates liquidity to be sufficient through December 31, 2016. In addition, CEC entered into the CIE Proceeds and Reservation Rights Agreement (as amended on October 7, 2016) with CIE, CEOC and CAC (the  CIE Proceeds Agreement ), which allows for up to   $235 million   of the proceeds from the SMG Business sale to be distributed to CEC in order to pay certain fees in support of the Restructuring ( CEC Expense Amounts ). After taking into account the cash available to pay the CEC Expense Amounts, CEC expects to have sufficient cash to meet its ongoing obligations as they come due. However, there are restrictions governing when and how the cash designated for CEC Expense Amounts can be used, pursuant to the terms of the Second Lien RSA (defined below) (see   Note 2  ). CEC also expects to gain access to the remaining proceeds from the sale of the SMG Business upon completion of the Merger, which will be used to fund its other commitments in support of the Restructuring. 
  If CEC is unable to access additional sources of cash when needed, in the event of a material adverse ruling on one or all of the litigation matters disclosed in   Note 1  , or if CEOC does not emerge from bankruptcy on a timely basis on terms and under circumstances satisfactory to CEC, it is likely that CEC would seek reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
  CIE s Sale of the SMG Business 
  On   September 23, 2016  , CIE sold the SMG Business for cash consideration of   $4.4 billion  , subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and retained only its World Series of Poker and regulated online real money gaming businesses. The SMG Business represented the majority of CIE s operations and was classified as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Historical results of the SMG Business have been recast as discontinued operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , and the related assets and liabilities have been recast as held for sale as of   December 31, 2015   (see  Discontinued Operations  in the Discussion of Operating Results section below and   Note 14  ). 
  Upon closing the sale of the SMG Business, all outstanding CIE stock-based compensation awards were deemed fully vested and subsequently canceled in return for the right to receive a cash payment. CIE s stock-based compensation expense directly identifiable with employees of the SMG Business was   $212 million   and   $263 million   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which represented increases compared with 2015 of   $203 million   and   $245 million  , respectively. These expense amounts were reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Statements of Operations. Stock-based compensation expense not directly identifiable with employees of the SMG Business of   $145 million   and   $188 million   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which represented increases compared with 2015 of   $132 million   and   $164 million  , respectively, was included in property, general, administrative, and other in the Statements of Operations. For both the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the majority of stock-based compensation expense resulted from the acceleration of the vesting of CIE stock-based compensation awards.

Discussion of Operating Results 
  
  As described above and in   Note 1  , we deconsolidated CEOC effective January 15, 2015. Headings below labeled  CERP and CGP  represent the combined results of the entities that remain in the consolidated Caesars entity subsequent to the deconsolidation of CEOC, and do not include the results of CEOC or the SMG Business. Where we have presented an analysis of other factors affecting net income/(loss) and consolidated results by reportable segment, this information includes CEOC as a reportable segment for the first 15 days of 2015. 
  Segment results in this MD A are presented consistent with the way Caesars management assesses the results subsequent to the deconsolidation of CEOC, which is a consolidated view that adjusts for the impact of certain transactions between reportable segments within Caesars for all periods presented. Therefore, the results of certain reportable segments presented in this filing differ from the financial statement information presented in their separate filings.  Other  includes parent, consolidating, and other adjustments to reconcile to consolidated Caesars results.

     Net revenues increased   $29 million   and   $78 million   in the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. During both periods, the most significant improvement came from rooms revenues from hotel stays at our casino properties. Our gaming-related revenues and operating performance are dependent upon the volume and spend behavior of customers at our resort properties, which affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities, and directly impacts our gaming volumes. The following are key drivers of year over year performance. 

____________________ 
            (1)   
    Average cash daily rate ( cash ADR ) is a key indicator by which we evaluate the performance of our properties and is determined by room revenue and rooms occupied.  
     CERP Performance 
  Net revenues increased   $27 million   for the third quarter of 2016 and   $22 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The increases were attributable to the following: 
              
    Rooms revenue was negatively affected by scheduled room renovations at Harrah s Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas, which resulted in over   32,000   room nights out of service during the   third quarter of 2016   and over   90,000   room nights during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
                
    Casino revenues increased during the   third quarter of 2016   primarily due to higher gaming volumes in Nevada, as well as favorable gaming hold. Casino revenues declined for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due to declines in gaming volumes, primarily in Atlantic City. 
     
    47 

Other revenues increased   $10 million   and   $11 million   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, driven by increases at Rio Las Vegas, which contributed to higher entertainment revenue. 
     CGP Performance 
  Net revenues increased   $4 million   for the third quarter of   2016   and   $67 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The increases were attributable to the following: 
             
    CGP experienced unfavorable gaming hold in both the quarter and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily in New Orleans. Casino revenues during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were also negatively impacted in part by the New Orleans smoking ban that was enacted in April 2015. These declines were partially offset by an increase of   $24 million   in casino revenues at Horseshoe Baltimore for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as the area recovered from poor performance experienced in 2015 resulting from a period of civil unrest in Baltimore. 
                 
    Food and beverage revenues declined   $7 million   during the   third quarter of 2016  . Las Vegas experienced less banquet business primarily due to a promotional event in   2015   that did not reoccur in the current year. 
                
    Higher other revenues in   2016   were driven primarily by increases at Planet Hollywood Resort   Casino, which contributed to higher entertainment revenue of   $9 million   for the third quarter of 2016 and   $30 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
     Analysis of Key Drivers of Income/(Loss) from Operations Performance 
  We generated a loss from operations of   $44 million   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to income from operations of   $84 million   in the prior year quarter. Income from operations decreased   $141 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The key drivers of income/(loss) from operations in both periods are primarily revenue; property, general, administrative, and other; and depreciation and amortization. The increases in property, general, administrative, and other are mainly due to stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of the vesting of CIE equity awards (see  CGP Performance  below).

CEC Performance 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , other operating costs improved compared with   2015   because   2015   includes the accrual of a   $35 million   additional payment to CEOC (see   Note 1  ) and a   $107 million   intercompany elimination of the impact of CGP s contingently issuable non-voting membership units. The fair value of CGP s contingently issuable non-voting membership units represented a liability from CGP to CEC until they were issued during   2016   (see   Note 2  ). Therefore, the effect of changes in this liability on CGP s income from operations is eliminated in consolidation and reported in  other  in the table above. 
  CERP Performance 
  Income from operations was primarily affected by the revenue increases described above, offset by increases of   $11 million   in depreciation and amortization expense for the   third quarter of 2016   and   $44 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . These increases mostly resulted from accelerated depreciation of   $8 million   and   $32 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to the removal and replacement of certain assets related to ongoing property renovation projects primarily at Harrah s Las Vegas, Paris Las Vegas, and Flamingo Las Vegas, as well as depreciation expense related to the Atlantic City Conference Center of   $4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  CGP Performance 
  Income/(loss) from operations decreased   $141 million   and   $245 million   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods. However, excluding the impact of contingently issuable non-voting membership units from both periods, CGP s income/(loss) from operations decreased   $148 million   and   $138 million  , respectively. The decreases are mainly due to the accelerated vesting of CIE equity awards resulting in increases in CIE stock-based compensation expense of   $132 million   during the   third quarter of 2016   and   $164 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . In addition, CIE incurred costs related to the sale of the SMG Business. 
  Interest Expense and Other Factors that Affect Net Income/(Loss)

     Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was flat for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the prior year quarter. The CEOC deconsolidation resulted in an   $87 million   decrease in interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared  
  
    50 

with the prior year period. Excluding this effect, interest expense increased   $5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Deconsolidation and Restructuring of CEOC and Other 
  As described in   Note 1  , we recognized certain obligations that we believe will ultimately be settled under the amended plan of reorganization filed on   October 20, 2016   or the RSAs. As a result, during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we accrued additional expenses associated with the CEOC restructuring totaling   $3.0 billion   and   $5.3 billion  , respectively. A portion of the obligations we recognized reflect our estimates of the fair value of the consideration CEC has agreed to provide in exchange for the settlement of litigation claims and potential claims against CEC and its affiliates. As described in   Note 7  , these obligations will be accounted for at fair value each period until they are ultimately settled as part of the Restructuring, and a fluctuation in the value of one or more of the inputs to our fair value estimates could result in a significant adjustment to the fair value of these obligations. 
  Effective   January 15, 2015  , we deconsolidated CEOC and recognized a gain of   $7.1 billion   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (see   Note 2  ). 
  Income Taxes on Continuing Operations 
  The effective tax rates were negative   0.8%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   20.6%   for the three months ended September 30,   2015  . The effective tax rates were negative   0.7%   and negative   0.8%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. See   Note 13   for a detailed discussion of income taxes and the effective tax rate. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  On September 23, 2016, CIE sold its SMG Business for $4.4 billion cash consideration, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $4.2 billion  . See   Note 14  . 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  
  Liquidity Discussion and Analysis 
  As described above, CEOC filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and we deconsolidated CEOC effective January 15, 2015. As such, all amounts presented in the following analysis exclude the amounts related to CEOC for periods subsequent to the deconsolidation of CEOC. 
  As stated previously, there is substantial doubt as to CEC s ability to continue as a going concern as we have limited unrestricted cash available to meet the financial commitments of CEC, primarily resulting from significant expenditures made to (1) defend the Company in the litigation discussed in   Note 3   and (2) support the Restructuring. In addition, we have made material future commitments to support the Restructuring, and we are a defendant in litigation, including the Noteholder Disputes, and other noteholder disputes relating to certain CEOC transactions dating back to 2010, that if resolved against us would raise substantial doubt about CEC s ability to continue as a going concern. See   Note 1   for a full description. 
  Caesars is a highly-leveraged company and had   $6.9 billion   in face value debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . As a result, a significant portion of our liquidity needs are for debt service, including significant interest payments. As detailed in the table below, our estimated consolidated debt service obligation for the remainder of   2016   (including principal and interest) is   $286 million   and   $9.3 billion   thereafter to maturity. 
  CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations, employees, or debt issuances of its own. It has ownership interests in CEOC, CERP and CGP. CEC has no requirement to fund the operations of CEOC, CERP, CGP, or their subsidiaries. CEC cash outflows are primarily used for corporate development opportunities, other corporate-level activity, litigation, and restructuring expenses associated with CEOC s bankruptcy. CEC does not receive any financial benefit from CEOC during the bankruptcy, as all earnings and cash flows are retained by CEOC. In addition, because CEC has no operations of its own and due to the restrictions under its subsidiaries  lending arrangements, CEC has limited ability to raise additional capital. 
  Cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016   as shown in the table below, includes amounts held by CERP, CGP, and Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC ( CES ), which are not readily available to CEC.  Other  reflects CEC and certain of its direct subsidiaries, including   $107 million   related to its insurance captives.

____________________ 
            (1)   
    Debt principal payments are estimated amounts based on maturity dates and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Interest payments are estimated based on the forward-looking LIBOR curve. Actual payments may differ from these estimates. 
     We generated consolidated operating cash inflows of   $454 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , including operating cash inflows of   $299 million   and   $288 million   from CERP and CGP, respectively. Our cash flows from operations include outflows by CEC related to the Restructuring of CEOC and by CES related to cash payments on behalf of its Members for expenses accrued but not paid during 2015. 
  CERP and CGP s sources of liquidity are independent of one another and primarily include currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from their operations, and borrowings under their separate revolving credit facilities (see   Note 9  ). Operating cash inflows are typically used for operating expenses, debt service costs, and working capital needs. CERP and CGP are highly leveraged, and a significant portion of their liquidity needs are for debt service, as summarized above. 
  CERP generated a net loss of   $2 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which includes the impact of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense of   $195 million   during the period and changes in deferred income taxes of   $14 million  . Other than accelerated depreciation and amortization expense compared with the prior year (described above), CERP s operating activities were stable and yielded operating cash flows of   $299 million  , an   11%   increase from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to improvement in CERP s operating results in   2016  , including the increase in net revenues discussed above, the timing of CERP s payments for amounts due to affiliates, and largely offsetting working capital fluctuations. 
  CERP s capital expenditures were   $87 million   during the 2016 period in support of its ongoing property renovations, a decrease of   $15 million  , or   15%  , compared with the prior year period. In addition to acquisitions of property and equipment, CERP also has commitments related to its long-term debt and, from time to time, its revolving credit facility. In 2016, CERP incurred   $297 million   of interest expense, of which   $239 million   was paid in cash, and repaid   $108 million   of debt primarily on its revolving credit facility (  $173 million   in payments less   $65 million   in revolver draws). 
  CGP generated net income of   $3.9 billion   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which includes a pre-tax gain of   $4.2 billion   on the sale of the SMG Business as well as the impact of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense of   $130 million   and stock-based compensation expense of   $192 million   during the period. CGP s operating cash flows increased to   $288 million  , which is an improvement of   $173 million   compared with the prior year period primarily due to the improved operating results described above for CGP. 
  CGP s capital expenditures were   $45 million   during the 2016 period, which was a reduction of   $103 million   compared with the prior year period due to property renovations that were completed during the first half of 2015. In addition to acquisitions of property and equipment, CGP also has commitments related to its long-term debt and revolving credit facility. In 2016, CGP incurred   $149 million   of interest expense, of which   $124 million   was paid in cash, and repaid   $67 million   in debt primarily on its revolving credit facility (  $82 million   in payments less   $15 million   in revolver draws). 
  CERP and CGP s ability to fund operations, pay debt obligations, and fund planned capital expenditures depends, in part, upon economic and other factors that are beyond their control, and disruptions in capital markets and restrictive covenants related to  
  
    52 

their existing debt could impact their ability to fund liquidity needs, pay indebtedness, and secure additional funds through financing activities. 
  We believe that CERP and CGP s cash flows from operations are sufficient to cover planned capital expenditures for ongoing property renovations during the remainder of 2016, as well as remaining 2016 estimated interest and principal payments due on long-term debt totaling   $286 million  . However, if needed, their existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under their revolving credit facilities are available to further support operations during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictions under their lending arrangements generally prevent the distribution of cash to CEC, except for certain restricted payments. 
  The foregoing liquidity discussions are forward-looking statements based on assumptions as of the date of this filing that may or may not prove to be correct. Actual results may differ materially from CEC s present expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from present expectations include, without limitation, the results of ongoing bankruptcy proceedings of CEOC and the positive or negative changes in the operational and other matters assumed in preparing the CEC forecasts. 
  Capital Spending and Development 
  We incur capital expenditures in the normal course of business, and we perform ongoing refurbishment and maintenance at our existing casino entertainment facilities to maintain our quality standards. We also continue to pursue development and acquisition opportunities for additional casino entertainment and other hospitality facilities, and online businesses that meet our strategic and return on investment criteria. Cash used for capital expenditures in the normal course of business is typically made available from cash flows generated by our operating activities and established debt programs, while cash used for development projects is typically funded from established debt programs, specific project financing, and additional debt offerings. 

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , capital expenditures were primarily related to hotel renovation projects at Harrah s Las Vegas, Paris Las Vegas, and Planet Hollywood. Capital expenditures decreased compared with the prior year period primarily due to the completion of the Atlantic City Conference Center which was still under construction in the first quarter 2015. 

We expect to fund these capital expenditures from cash flows generated by our operating activities. CES capital expenditures will be funded by its Members. Our projected capital expenditures for 2016 include estimates for: 
             
    remodel projects at CERP s Paris Las Vegas and Harrah s Atlantic City; 
                
    remodel projects at CGP s Planet Hollywood; 
     
    53 

hospitality and maintenance projects; and 
                
    IT, marketing, analytics, accounting, payroll, and other projects that benefit the operating structures. 
     Our planned development projects, if they proceed, will require, individually and in the aggregate, significant capital commitments. When completed, these projects may result in significant additional revenues. The commitment of capital, the timing of completion, and the commencement of operations of development projects are contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of final agreements and receipt of approvals from the appropriate political and regulatory bodies. We must also comply with covenants and restrictions set forth in our debt agreements. 
  There are various risks and uncertainties and the expected capital expenditures set forth above may change for various reasons, including our financial performance, market conditions and the CEOC bankruptcy process. 
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  Material changes to our aggregate indebtedness, if any, are described in   Note 9  . 
  Except as described in   Note 1  , as of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no other material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our other known contractual obligations, which are set forth in the table included in Item 7 in our   2015   10-K. 
  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) is presented as a measure of the Company s performance. Property EBITDA is defined as revenues less property operating expenses and is comprised of net income/(loss) before (i) interest expense, net of interest capitalized and interest income, (ii) income tax provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) corporate expenses, and (v) certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance at an operating property level. As a result of the sale of the SMG Business (see   Note 1  ), we have determined that CIE stock-based compensation expense should be excluded from Property EBITDA as management no longer considers such expense to be indicative of Caesars Entertainment s ongoing consolidated or segment operating performance. Therefore, Property EBITDA has been recast for prior periods to be consistent to the current year presentation. 
  In evaluating Property EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Property EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items. 
  Property EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income/(loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with   accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ))  . Property EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Property EBITDA is included because management uses Property EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Property EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE PRIVATE  
  SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or may contain "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. Further, statements that include words such as "may," "will," "project," "might," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "could," "would," "estimate," "continue," "present," "preserve," or "pursue," or the negative of these words or other words or expressions of similar meaning may identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this report. These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to future actions, new projects, strategies, future performance, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, the Restructuring and future financial results, wherever they occur in this report, are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important factors set forth above and from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements include without limitation: 
             
    the effects of CEOC s bankruptcy on CEOC and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us, and the interest of various creditors, equity holders and other constituents; 
                
    CEC s limited cash balances and sources of available cash, including CEC s ability (or inability) to secure additional liquidity to meet its ongoing obligations and its commitments to support the Restructuring as necessary and CEC s financial obligations exceeding or becoming due earlier than what is currently forecast; 
                
    the event that the RSAs may not be consummated in accordance with their terms, or persons not party to the RSAs may successfully challenge the implementation thereof;  
                
    the length of time CEOC will operate in the Chapter 11 cases and CEOC s failure to comply with the milestones previously provided by the RSAs or that may be included in other agreements relating to the Restructuring;
