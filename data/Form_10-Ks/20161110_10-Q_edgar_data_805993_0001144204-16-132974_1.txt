NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 September 30, 2016 (Unaudited) 

1.    Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies:    

The accompanying unaudited 2016 financial
statements of Uniprop Manufactured Housing Communities Income Fund II, a Michigan Limited Partnership (the  Partnership )
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015
has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or for any other
interim period. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Partnership s
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

During the fourth quarter of 2012, Management
initiated the Sunshine Village Paid Home Relocation Program ( Program ). The Program was offered exclusively to residents
of Seminole Estates, a 704 site, 55 and over manufactured home community in Hollywood, Florida that announced its closure. The
Program expired in the first quarter of 2013. By the end of the first quarter of 2014, all 41 residents have successfully relocated.
The Partnership incurred expenditures of $903,232, of which $816,203 has been capitalized and was being amortized as a reduction
of rental revenue over the life of the residents  three year rental period. As of June 30, 2016, the entire balance of deferred
home relocation costs had been amortized against revenue. 

The carrying amounts of cash and accounts
payable approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of mortgage notes payable approximates their
carrying amounts based on current borrowing rates. 

We have evaluated subsequent events through
the date of this filing. We do not believe there are any material subsequent events which would require further disclosure. 

2.    Mortgage Payable:    

The Partnership has two mortgage notes
payable with Cantor Commercial Real Estate collateralized by Sunshine Village, located in Davie, Florida and West Valley, located
in Las Vegas, Nevada. The mortgages are payable in monthly installments of interest and principal through August, 2023. These refinanced
notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.09% with principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization period. As of September
30, 2016 the balance on these notes was $18,089,984. 

Future maturities on the notes payable
for the next five years and thereafter are as follows: 2016 - $109,526; 2017 - $449,922; 2018 - $473,724; 2019 - $498,786; 2020
- $522,749 and thereafter - $16,035,277. 

3.    Discontinued Operations:    

As described in the Form 8-K dated February
29, 2016, the Partnership closed on the sale of the Ardmor Village for a sale price of $10,587,274 less closing costs resulting
in proceeds in the amount of $10,551,474, and the gain on the sale was approximately $8,070,000. The mortgage payable outstanding
related to this property in the amount of $2,559,737, accrued interest of $8,742, prepayment penalty of $257,247, offset by a refund
of the property tax escrow balance of $50,055 totaled $2,775,722, was paid in full at the time of closing. The Partnership also
wrote off $98,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the mortgage note in connection with this transaction. The
net cash proceeds resulting from the sale and pay off of the mortgage note were approximately $7,690,000. 

As described in the Form 8-K dated August
20, 2015, the Partnership closed on the sale of the three manufactured housing communities located in Michigan, namely Camelot
Manor, Dutch Hills and Stonegate with Meritus Communities LLC for a purchase price of $14,200,000, less closing costs resulting
in net proceeds in the amount of $13,777,650. The Partnership recognized a gain of $6,022,387. The mortgage obligations related
to these properties of $3,052,889 were paid in full at the time of closing with proceeds from the sale. As part of the repayment
on the mortgage notes, the Partnership incurred $346,693 in prepayment penalties. The Partnership also wrote off $116,113 of unamortized
deferred financing costs related to the mortgage notes in connection with this transaction. The net cash proceeds resulting from
the sale and pay off of the mortgage notes were approximately $10,108,000. 

As described in the Form 8-K dated September
28, 2015, the Partnership closed on the sale of the El Adobe manufactured housing community located in Las Vegas, Nevada with Lakeshore
Communities Inc. for a purchase price of $6,700,000, less closing costs resulting in proceeds in the amount of $6,490,120. The

The Partnership also wrote off $126,672 of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the mortgage note in connection with
this transaction. The net cash proceeds resulting from the sale and pay off of the mortgage note were approximately $2,458,000. 

The property sales of Ardmor Village, Camelot
Manor, Dutch Hills, El Adobe and Stonegate, constitute a strategic shift of the Partnership and as a result the associated financial
results have been classified as  discontinued operations  in the accompanying financial statements for all historical
periods. 

The following is a summary of results of
operations of the properties classified as discontinued operations for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:
Total Revenue was $170,650, Total Operating Expenses were $842,711 and the Gain on Sale was $8,069,909 for the period ended September
30, 2016. For the same period in 2015, Total Revenue was $3,616,740, Total Operating Expenses were $5,193,526 and the Gain on Sale
was $9,937,765. 

The following is a summary of results of
operations of the properties classified as discontinued operations for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:
Total Revenue was $0 and Total Operating Expenses were $0 for the period ended September 30, 2016. For the same period in 2015,
Total Revenue was $821,165, Total Operating Expenses were $2,586,169, and the Gain on Sale was $9,937,675.

ITEM 2.  

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF  

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF
OPERATIONS  

Critical Accounting Policies  

See Part II, Item 7   Critical Accounting
Policies, our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part IV, Item 15 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016 for accounting policies and related estimates we believe are
the most critical to understanding condensed consolidated financial statements, financial conditions and results of operations
and which require complex management judgment and assumptions or involve uncertainties. There have been no material changes to
the critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in that report. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Uniprop Manufactured Housing Communities Income Fund II, a Michigan
Limited Partnership s (the  Partnership ) liquidity is based, in part, upon its investment strategy. On February
26, 2016 the sale of Ardmor Village closed as described previously, leaving the Fund with only two properties: Sunshine Village
and West Valley. 

Management does not believe that it is economically rational
to operate a limited partnership that has a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with only
two properties. The costs of compliance are simply too high when amortized over only two properties. 

As a result, management intends to liquidate Sunshine Village
and West Valley, and then dissolve the Fund in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. 

The Partnership expects to meet its short-term
liquidity needs generally through its working capital and cash provided by operating activities. 

On July 18, 2013, the Partnership refinanced
its existing mortgage notes payable and executed two new mortgages payable in the amount of $19,320,000 secured by Sunshine Village,
located in Davie, FL and West Valley, located in Las Vegas, NV with a new lender, namely Cantor Commercial Real Estate. The mortgage
notes are payable in monthly installments of interest and principal through August, 2023. The refinanced notes bear interest at
a fixed rate of 5.09% with principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization period. As of September 30, 2016 the balance
on these notes was $18,089,984. 

The Partnership incurred $676,321 in financing
costs as a result of the 2013 refinancing which is being amortized over the term of the loans. These costs included a 1% fee payable
to an affiliate of the General Partner. 

The General Partner has decided to distribute
$132,135, or $.04 per unit, to the unit holders for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. The General Partner will continue
to monitor cash flow generated by the Partnership s properties during the coming quarters. If cash flow generated is greater
or lesser than the amount needed to maintain the current distribution level, the General Partner may elect to reduce or increase
the level of future distributions paid to Unit Holders. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership s
cash balance amounted to $7,528,689. The level of cash balance maintained is at the discretion of the General Partner. 

Results of Operations  

Overall, as illustrated in the following
table, the Partnership's two properties reported combined occupancy of 72% at the end of September 2016 versus 71% at the end of
September 2015. The average monthly homesite rent as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $682; versus $660 from September 2015
(average rent not a weighted average). 

*Not a weighted average  

Net Operating Income ( NOI )
is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, plus depreciation, interest expense,
partnership management expense, and other expenses. The Partnership believes that NOI is useful to investors and the Partnership s
management as an indication of the Partnership s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions. NOI presented by the
Partnership may not be comparable to NOI reported by other companies that define NOI differently, and should not be considered
as an alternative to net income as an indication of performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. 

Comparison of Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Gross revenues from continuing operations
increased $138,941 to $1,219,592 in 2016, from $1,080,651 in 2015. This was due to increases in market rent value from the prior
year. In addition, the amortization of relocation costs relating to the Sunshine Village relocation project was completed during
second quarter 2016. 

As described in the Statements of Operations,
total operating expenses from continuing operations decreased $155,869, to $1,301,028 in 2016, as compared to $1,456,897 in 2015.
This was mainly due to a decrease in administrative expenses offset by an increase in property operations expenses compared to
the prior year. 

As a result of the aforementioned factors,
the Partnership experienced a Net Loss from continuing operations of $81,436 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a Net Loss
of $376,246 for the third quarter of 2015. 

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Gross revenues from continuing operations
increased $429,032 to $3,651,610 in 2016, from $3,222,578 in 2015. This was due to increases in market rent value from the prior
year, as well as increases in home sale income and lease home income. In addition, the amortization of relocation costs relating
to the Sunshine Village relocation project was completed during second quarter 2016. 

As described in the Statements of Operations,
total operating expenses from continuing operations increased $453,761 to $4,045,039 in 2016, as compared to $3,591,278 in 2015.
This was mainly due to increases in administrative, property operations and home sale expenses compared to the prior year. 

As a result of the aforementioned factors,
the Partnership experienced a Net Loss from continuing operations of $393,429 in 2016 as compared to a Net Loss of $368,700 in
2015. 

ITEM 3.  

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE 

  DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

The Partnership is exposed to interest
rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities. There is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed
at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest
rates and the Partnership s future financing requirements. 

Note Payable: At September 30, 2016 the
Partnership had notes payable outstanding in the amount of $18,089,984. Interest on these notes is at a fixed annual rate of 5.09%
through August 2023. 

The Partnership does not enter into financial
instruments transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage its interest rate exposure. 

ITEM 4.   

  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, the Partnership carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive
Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the
Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the quarterly report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. 

There was no change in the Partnership s
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent completed quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER
INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

None. 

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS    

In addition to the other information set forth in this report,
you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item IA. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The
risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition
and/or operating results.
