   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
     
   NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
    Basis of Presentation    
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ).  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
     
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year.  The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  
     
    Management Estimates    
     
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.  Descriptions of these policies are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.  As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.  Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.  
     
    Currency Translation and Transactions    
     
  All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.  Unrealized translation gains (losses), net of tax, reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. were de minimis for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $(84) million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.  Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.  
     
  The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions of $5 million and $(5) million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
    Accounts Receivable    
     
  Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $25 million and $24 million as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  
     
    Concentration of Credit Risk    
     
  The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  The Company s sales subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business.  The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.

This customer accounted for $247 million, or 15%, and $164 million, or 13%, of the Company s accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.

    Income Taxes    
     
  The effective rate for income taxes was 26.6% and 29.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a lower effective tax rate on the Company s foreign operations, as well as a reduction in income tax reserves.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaled $83 million and $82 million, respectively.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $55 million. The total gross interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $1 million.  The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 was $19 million and $18 million, respectively.  On the basis of the information available as of September 30, 2016, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in a range of $10 million to $15 million within the next twelve months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies and a potential lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations.  
     
    Debt    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $270 million of commercial paper outstanding, maturing through November 2016, which the Company is refinancing on a periodic basis at prevailing market interest rates as it matures. In October 2016, the Company increased the size of its commercial paper program to $1.5 billion (from $1.0 billion) under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States.  
     
  In October 2016, the Company replaced its undrawn $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on July 15, 2020 (the  Prior Facility ) with a new $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on October 3, 2021, unless extended for up to two additional years in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement (the  New Facility ).   At September 30, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the Prior Facility.  The New Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.  Up to the equivalent of $500 million of the New Facility is available for multi-currency loans.  Interest rates on borrowings under the New Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement.  The Company incurred costs of approximately $1 million to establish the New Facility, which will be amortized over the term of the facility.  The New Facility has an annual fee of approximately $1 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company s current credit ratings.  The New Facility contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $175 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility. 
     
    Recently Issued Accounting Standards    
     
   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   
     
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to utilize an impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include trade and other receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to record an allowance for credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  In addition, this new guidance changes the recognition method for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which can occur as a result of market and credit risk, as well as additional disclosures.  In general, this guidance will require modified retrospective adoption for all outstanding instruments that fall under this guidance.

   Compensation - Stock Compensation   
     
  In March 2016, as part of its simplification initiative, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the way companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. This new guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation awards be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  In addition, companies are required to treat the tax effects of exercised or vested awards as discrete items in the period that they occur.  This guidance also permits an employer to withhold up to the maximum statutory withholding rates in a jurisdiction without triggering liability classification, allows companies to elect to account for forfeitures as they occur, and provides requirements for the cash flow classification of cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes and for the classification of excess tax benefits.  The new guidance prescribes different transition methods for the various provisions.  
     
   Effective date for the Company     Fiscal 2018 first quarter, with early adoption permitted. 
     
   Impact on consolidated financial statements     Currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance. 
     
   Leases   
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets with the liability being equal to the present value of the lease payments.  The right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability adjusted for certain costs such as direct costs.  Lease expense will be recognized similar to current accounting guidance with operating leases resulting in a straight-line expense, and financing leases resulting in a front-loaded expense similar to the current accounting for capital leases.  This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and provides for certain practical expedients.

   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers.  The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the principal versus agent guidance in its new revenue recognition standard.  These amendments do not change the key aspects of the principal versus agent guidance, including the definition that an entity is a principal if it controls the good or service prior to it being transferred to a customer, but the amendments clarify the implementation guidance related to the considerations that must be made during the contract evaluation process.  
     
  In April 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the new standard to clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.  
     
  In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarified certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements during the transition period related to completed contracts and contract modifications.  In addition, the FASB provided clarification on the concept of collectability, the calculation of the fair value of noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.  
     
  In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to reflect the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff s rescission of their prior comments that covered, among other things, accounting for shipping and handling costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer.

   NOTE 4   CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES   
     
   Background   
     
  In May 2016, the Company announced a multi-year initiative ( Leading Beauty Forward  or  LBF ) to build on its strengths and better leverage its cost structure to free resources for investment to continue its growth momentum.  LBF is designed to enhance the Company s go-to-market capabilities, reinforce its leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  
     
  The Company plans to approve specific initiatives under LBF through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expects to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through September 30, 2016, the Company expects that LBF will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million before taxes.  
     
  Restructuring actions to be taken over the duration of LBF involve the redesigning, resizing and reorganization of select corporate functions and go-to-market structures to improve effectiveness and create cost efficiencies in support of increased investment in growth drivers.  As the Company continues to grow, it is important to more efficiently support its diverse portfolio of brands, channels and geographies in the rapidly evolving prestige beauty environment.  The initiatives being evaluated include the creation of a shared-services structure, either through Company-owned or third-party service providers in existing or lower-cost locations.  The Company also believes that decision-making in key areas of innovation, marketing and digital communications should be moved closer to the consumer to increase speed and local relevance.  
     
  In connection with LBF, at this time, the Company estimates a net reduction in the range of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions globally, which is about 2.5% of its current workforce. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas.  
     
   Program-to-Date Approvals   
     
  Of the $600 million to $700 million restructuring and other charges expected to be incurred, total cumulative charges approved by the Company through September 30, 2016 were:  

Included in the above table, cumulative restructuring initiatives approved by the Company through September 30, 2016 by major cost type were:  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the  Company continued to approve initiatives to enhance its go-to-market support structures and achieve synergies across certain geographic regions, brands and channels.  These initiatives are primarily intended to shift certain areas of focus from traditional to social and digital marketing strategies to provide enhanced consumer experience, as well as to support expanded omnichannel opportunities.  These actions will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities.

   Program-to-Date Restructuring and Other Charges   
     
  The Company records approved charges associated with restructuring activities once the relevant accounting criteria have been met.  Total cumulative charges recorded associated with restructuring initiatives for LBF were:  

Charges recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 included returns (and the related cost of sales) and inventory write-offs related to the exit of certain businesses in select markets and channels of distribution.  Cost of sales also included consulting and professional services incurred related to the design of supply chain planning activities.  Other charges associated with LBF initiatives primarily reflected consulting and other professional services related to the design of the future structures, processes and technologies of certain corporate functions and, to a lesser extent, costs to establish and maintain the LBF Project Management Office.  Other charges are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.  
     
  Included in the above table, aggregate restructuring charges by major cost type were:  

Accrued restructuring charges from program inception through September 30, 2016 were:  

Accrued restructuring charges at September 30, 2016 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $26 million, $36 million and $8 million in fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

   NOTE 5   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
     
  The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances.  The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.  
     
  For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments  effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.  This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.  The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedges and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.  If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Cash-Flow Hedges    
     
  The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.  The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.  The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of September 2018.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  The Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.  
     
  The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and interest rate derivatives is recorded in current-period earnings.  For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.  If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $2,758 million.  The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($398 million), British pound ($398 million), Swiss franc ($324 million), Hong Kong dollar ($311 million), Chinese yuan ($291 million), Australian dollar ($146 million) and Japanese yen ($129 million).  
     
  The estimated net gain on the Company s derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges as of September 30, 2016 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $11 million.  The accumulated gain on derivative instruments in AOCI was $44 million and $50 million as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  
     
    Fair-Value Hedges    
     
  The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with a notional amount totaling $250 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2022 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin.  These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.  
     
    Credit Risk    
     
  As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.  The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $51 million at September 30, 2016.  To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.  Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.

  The Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment.  The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:  
     
  Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.  
     
  Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  
     
  Level 3: Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.  
     
  The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016:

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016:  

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:  

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:  
     
   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, money market funds and time deposits. The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments. 
     
   Available-for-sale securities     Available-for-sale securities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and are valued using third-party pricing services, and for time deposits, the carrying amount approximates fair value. To determine fair value, the pricing services use market prices or prices derived from other observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.

   Foreign currency forward contracts     The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.  The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.  To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months. 
     
   Interest rate swap contracts     The fair values of the Company s interest rate swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach.  The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services. 
     
   Current and long-term debt     The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.  To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.  The Company s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
     
   Additional purchase price payable     The Company s additional purchase price payable represents fixed minimum additional purchase price that was discounted using the Company s incremental borrowing rate, which was approximately 1%.  The additional purchase price payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
     
   Contingent consideration     Contingent consideration obligations consist of potential obligations related to our acquisitions. The amounts to be paid under these obligations are contingent upon the achievement of stipulated financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition. The fair values of the contingent consideration related to certain acquisition earn-outs were estimated using a probability-weighted discount model that considers the achievement of the conditions upon which the respective contingent obligation is dependent ( Monte Carlo Method ).  The Monte Carlo Method has various inputs into the valuation model that include, at September 30, 2016, the risk-adjusted projected future operating results of the acquired entity, a risk-adjusted discount rate ranging from 1.2% to 1.7%, a measure of revenue volatility ranging from 4.8% to 14.0%, an asset volatility ranging from 28.6% to 31.0% and a revenue/earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization correlation factor of 80%.  Significant changes in the projected future operating results would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.  Changes to the discount rate, volatility or correlation factors would have a lesser effect.  The implied rates are deemed to be unobservable inputs and, as such, the Company s contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
     
  Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were as follows:

   NOTE 7   PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS   
     
  The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.  The Company also maintains post-retirement benefit plans which provide certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.  Descriptions of these plans are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  
     
  The components of net periodic benefit cost for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made contributions to its international pension plans totaling approximately $2 million.  
     
  The amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets related to the Company s pension and post-retirement benefit plans consist of the following:  

NOTE 8   CONTINGENCIES   
     
    Legal Proceedings    
     
  The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business.  Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  However, management s assessment of the Company s current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.  Reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

   NOTE 9   STOCK PROGRAMS   
     
  Total net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of, and the remaining requisite service periods of, stock options, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance share units ( PSUs ), PSUs based on total stockholder return ( TSR ), long-term PSUs, and share units.  Compensation expense attributable to net stock-based compensation is as follows:  

Stock Options    
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted approximately 2.4 million stock options with a weighted-average exercise price per share of $89.47 and a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $22.83. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $32 million.  
     
    Restricted Stock Units    
     
  The Company granted approximately 1.4 million RSUs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $89.47 which, at the time of grant, were scheduled to vest as follows: 0.5 million in fiscal 2018, 0.5 million in fiscal 2019 and 0.4 million in fiscal 2020.  All RSUs are subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.  The RSUs granted are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights, payable upon settlement either in cash or shares (based on the terms of the particular award) and, as such, were valued at the closing market price of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.  
     
    Performance Share Units    
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted approximately 0.3 million PSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $89.47, which will be settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company s net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital goals for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 2019, all subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.  PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement.  In September 2016, approximately 0.3 million shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock were issued and related accrued dividends were paid, relative to the target goals set at the time of the issuance, in settlement of 0.3 million PSUs which vested as of June 30, 2016.  
     
    Performance Share Units Based on Total Stockholder Return    
     
  In September 2016, 49,882 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock were issued, and related dividends paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant, related to the performance period ended June 30, 2016.  
     
   NOTE 10   NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC. PER COMMON SHARE   
     
  Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share ( basic EPS ) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).  Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution ( diluted EPS ) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.

  A reconciliation between the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:  

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, outstanding options to purchase 2.6 million and 2.5 million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, 0.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock underlying PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 9   Stock Programs.  
     
   NOTE 11   EQUITY   

The following is a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on the Company s Class A and Class B Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016:  

On November 1, 2016, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.34 per share on the Company s Class A and Class B Common Stock.  The dividend is payable in cash on December 15, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2016.  
     
    Common Stock    
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased approximately 2.4 million shares of its Class A Common Stock for $222 million.

NOTE 13   SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION   
     
  Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the  Chief Executive ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.  Product category performance is measured based upon net sales and earnings before income taxes, interest expense and interest income and investment income, net.  Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  
     
  The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are substantially the same as those for the consolidated financial statements, as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.  There has been no significant variance in the total or long-lived asset values associated with the Company s segment data since June 30, 2016.

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
     
  We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories, which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.  The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and reflects the basis of presentation described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  for all periods presented.  Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance or hair care have been included in the  other  category.

  The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:  

In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling, and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.  The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.  The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.  
     
    Non-GAAP Financial Measures    
     
  We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  See   Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   beginning on page 39 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.  
     
  We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.  Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.  Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.  Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.  We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.  
     
    Overview    
     
  We believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers  changing behaviors and shopping preferences.  We are guided by our long-term strategy through fiscal 2019, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.  We plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.

  Our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty. We believe that our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass distribution.  Skin care, our most profitable product category historically, remains a strategic priority for us, and we continue to support our large, long-standing skin care product lines including Advanced Night Repair from Est e Lauder, Clinique s 3-Step Skin Care System and Cr me de la Mer from La Mer.  We also continue to develop and introduce new products, such as Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules and Advanced Night Repair Recovery Powerfoil Mask from Est e Lauder, The Pep-Start line of products from Clinique, and the Moisturizing Soft Lotion from La Mer.  While growth in global prestige skin care remained relatively slow, global prestige makeup continued to be the fastest growing category.  We introduced new makeup products, including new collections from our makeup artist brands and Smashbox, Double Wear Nude Cushion Stick Radiant Makeup and Pure Color Envy Hi-Lustre Light Sculpting Lipstick from Est e Lauder, and Superbalanced silk makeup broad spectrum SPF 15 from Clinique.  The continued rapid growth in this category has attracted new competitors as barriers to entry have lowered; however, we continue to believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities. Our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford fragrances, new launches such as Basil and Neroli from Jo Malone London, and incremental net sales from our fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian.  In addition, we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels.  To complement the strategies in our existing business, we are continuously looking to acquire and grow brands that we believe have significant growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future.  
     
  Our global footprint provides many avenues of growth.  We are leveraging our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to continue to be locally relevant with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.  We are seeking share growth in large, image-building core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and Korea by strengthening our presence in these areas.  In addition, we are broadening our presence in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico and South Africa.  In some markets, we continue to see slow department store traffic, which is particularly affecting Est e Lauder and M    A   C, as well as the impact of a decrease in tourism in the United States that has impacted certain M   A   C freestanding stores.  However, we are growing faster in other channels, where there is continued opportunity to add brands to existing markets and expand into new markets, such as e- and m-commerce and specialty multi-brand retailers.  In October 2016, we signed an agreement to acquire BECCA, a high-growth makeup brand that has a robust presence within specialty multi-brand retailers. 
     
  In North America, we are hosting targeted in-store events to support key innovations in multiple channels, and we are increasing our presence in specialty multi-brand retailers and freestanding retail stores.  We have opportunities to accelerate our growth within specialty multi-brand retailers by adding brands to existing retail locations and through new doors being opened by such retailers.   Internationally, we are expanding our business in freestanding stores, in European perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the United Kingdom and certain markets in Asia.  We approach distribution strategically by brand, as each is at a different stage of development. We seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies, matching each brand with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door.  We focus on those areas where we believe our brands will expand consumer coverage and gain high-quality distribution consistent with their positioning.  As part of this strategy, we continue to expand brands in our travel retail channel, which benefits from increasing international passenger traffic.  Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion, although it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers  willingness and ability to travel and spend.  We have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.  This includes partnering with our retailers to open individually branded boutiques within airports to compete more effectively in this channel.  We are broadening our online portfolio around the world by adding brands to existing markets and entering new markets, resulting in strong net sales growth in the online channel, and we continue to develop and test omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.  We have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world, which we expect will result in continued net sales growth in this channel.  Our success in delivering particularly strong online growth in emerging markets is a result of taking key learnings from our online strategy in established markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, and customizing them to meet local market needs.  To further drive our online sales, we are planning new e- and m-commerce site launches in new and existing markets, and we are extending our third-party platform model, which has been successful in China, into certain other international locations.

  While our business is performing well overall, we are faced with strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries. In particular, we are cautious of the continued slow retail environment in Hong Kong, and the decline in retail traffic primarily related to mid-tier department stores in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products.  We are also cautious of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies and its impact on tourism, which has particularly impacted certain M    A   C freestanding stores in the United States.  Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as Brazil and in the Middle East, the United Kingdom s anticipated exit from the European Union, and global security issues. 
     
  We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength, utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands, channels and markets.  However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, on our business.  We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.  
     
  We navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will promote sustainable results.  We are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.  We are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.  We will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.  Some initiatives will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.  We expect to leverage our top line growth through greater productivity due, in part, to cost savings and efficiencies from our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ).  
     
  In May 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative ( Leading Beauty Forward ) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.  Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through September 30, 2016, we expect that Leading Beauty Forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.  After its full implementation, we expect Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.  We expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives.  For additional information about Leading Beauty Forward, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4    Charges Associated with Restructuring Activities .  
     
  In addition to Leading Beauty Forward, investment in our global information systems is an ongoing process.  We have implemented initiatives to leverage our SMI foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies.  As we modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we continue to develop upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure, as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally.  These initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital, freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth.  
     
  As referenced by the Company, our heritage brands are Est e Lauder, Clinique and Origins.  M    A   C and Bobbi Brown are our makeup artist brands, and our luxury brands are La Mer, Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle and By Kilian.

   NET SALES   

(a)  See   Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   beginning on page 39 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 
     
  Reported net sales grew in each product category, with the exception of skin care, and in each geographic region, with the exception of the Americas.  Skin care net sales decreased slightly, due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.  However, this category benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly from La Mer and Origins.  Net sales increases from Tom Ford, Est e Lauder, Clinique and Smashbox drove growth in the makeup category.  Our fragrance category primarily benefited from net sales increases from Jo Malone London.  Increased sales from our acquisitions during the past two years also contributed to our skin care and fragrance businesses.  The net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by growth from Bumble and bumble in specialty multi-brand retailers, along with strategic targeted consumer reach.  Each of our product categories benefited from brand expansion, comparable door sales growth from certain brands, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets.  
     
  Returns associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  Accordingly, the following discussions of Net Sales by  Product Categories  and  Geographic Regions  exclude impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $2 million.

  Skin care net sales decreased, reflecting approximately $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  The reported net sales decrease reflected lower net sales from Est e Lauder and Clinique of approximately $45 million, combined. The decrease in net sales of Est e Lauder and Clinique products was due, in part, to lower sales in certain countries within Asia/Pacific, reflecting continued retail softness.  These lower net sales also reflected a difficult comparison with greater launch activity in the prior-year period.  These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of La Mer, Origins, Aveda and Bobbi Brown products of approximately $33 million, combined.  Net sales of La Mer products grew in all regions, reflecting the launch of The Moisturizing Soft Lotion, brand expansion in the travel retail channel, and increased sales of existing products.  The increase in net sales of Origins products was due, in part, to higher sales of facial mask products.  Net sales growth in skin care from Aveda was due to the introduction of the Tulasara line of products.  The increase in net sales of Bobbi Brown skin care products was due to the launch of the Instant Confident Stick.  
     
    Makeup    

(a)  See   Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   beginning on page 39 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 
     
  Makeup net sales increased slightly despite approximately $10 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The reported net sales increase primarily reflected higher net sales from Tom Ford, Est e Lauder, Clinique and Smashbox of approximately $37 million, combined. The increase in Tom Ford net sales was driven by higher sales of lip color products. Net sales of Est e Lauder products improved, partially due to higher sales from the Double Wear line of products and the Pure Color Envy franchise.  The higher net sales from Clinique reflected incremental sales from new launches such as Superbalanced silk makeup broad spectrum SPF 15.  Sales increases from Smashbox were primarily driven by specialty multi-brand retailers, reflecting the overall strength of the makeup category in that channel.  Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales from M    A   C, and to a lesser extent, Bobbi Brown of approximately $30 million, combined.  The lower net sales from M   A   C primarily reflected the decline in U.S. mid-tier department store traffic and in certain M   A   C freestanding stores in the United States as a result of a decrease in tourism.  The decrease in Bobbi Brown net sales was primarily due to a difficult comparison with the prior-year period that featured greater launch activity.

  Fragrance net sales increased despite approximately $11 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  The reported net sales increase primarily reflected higher net sales of luxury fragrances from Jo Malone London and Le Labo, as well as incremental sales from By Kilian of approximately $37 million, combined.  The higher net sales from Jo Malone London were, in part, due to strategic targeted consumer reach in the travel retail and department store channels, the recent launch of Basil and Neroli, and increased sales of existing products.  These increases were partially offset by lower net sales from certain designer fragrances of approximately $15 million.  
     
    Hair Care    

(a)  See   Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   beginning on page 39 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 
     
  Hair care net sales increased, primarily reflecting increased distribution of Bumble and bumble products in specialty multi-brand retailers, along with strategic targeted consumer reach.  Net sales from Aveda were slightly lower due to the planned launch of its hair care initiatives later this fiscal year.

  Net sales in the Americas decreased, primarily reflecting lower sales in the makeup category.  Net sales in the United States decreased approximately $42 million.  The decrease reflected lower makeup net sales from M    A   C, as well as lower net sales from certain designer fragrances. Net sales were impacted by a decline in retail traffic in the United States related primarily to mid-tier department stores that principally affected Est e Lauder and M   A   C, as well as certain M   A   C freestanding stores in the United States as a result of a decrease in tourism.  Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net sales in Latin America and Canada of approximately $7 million, combined.  The increase in sales in Latin America primarily reflected higher net sales in Mexico and Chile.

  Net sales in Europe, the Middle East   Africa increased despite approximately $43 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Higher sales from our travel retail business, and in Italy, Germany, Iberia and the Balkans totaled approximately $67 million, combined.  The sales growth in our travel retail business reflected higher net sales from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, M    A   C, Bobbi Brown and Aveda, driven in part by strategic targeted consumer reach and new product offerings.  The higher net sales in Italy, Germany, Iberia and the Balkans were primarily driven by increased net sales from Est e Lauder, Clinique, M   A   C and La Mer.  These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately $46 million, combined.  The lower net sales in the United Kingdom were due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  Excluding this impact, net sales in the United Kingdom increased, primarily driven by higher net sales from Tom Ford, Jo Malone London and Est e Lauder, partially reflecting the timing of new product launches. The lower net sales in the Middle East were primarily driven by the rebalancing of inventory levels by certain of our distributors reflecting the impact of the macroeconomic environment on consumer purchases. 
     
    Asia/Pacific

  Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased, reflecting approximately $14 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  Higher net sales in Japan, Korea and Australia totaled approximately $38 million, combined, partially reflecting the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, as well as increased sales from our makeup artist brands and certain of our luxury brands, including Jo Malone London and Tom Ford.  These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Hong Kong and China of approximately $9 million, combined.  The lower net sales in Hong Kong were primarily driven by the continued decrease in traveling Chinese consumers and changes in their spending patterns, which particularly impacted the Est e Lauder, Clinique and La Mer brands.  The decrease in net sales in China was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.  Excluding this impact, net sales in China increased, primarily reflecting successful promotional events both online and in store at specialty multi-brand retailers.  
     
  We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.

  The increase in operating expenses reflected higher stock-based compensation, primarily related to accounting for grants to retirement-eligible employees, and higher store operating costs related to selective global expansion.  These increases were partially offset by lower advertising, merchandising and sampling costs due, in part, to using media formats that carry lower cost structures.  
     
  Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.

  The overall operating results and operating margin were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $10 million, which negatively impacted each product category and geographic region, with the exception of hair care and Asia/Pacific.  In addition, the operating results for the current-year period include the impact of charges associated with restructuring activities of $31 million.  Adjusting for the impact of the charges associated with restructuring activities, operating income would have decreased 1% and operating margin would have decreased 30 basis points.  
     
  Charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  Accordingly, the following discussions of Operating Income by  Product Categories  and  Geographic Regions  exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring activities.  
     
    Product Categories    
     
    Skin Care    

Skin care operating income increased, reflecting higher results from Clinique, La Mer and Est e Lauder.  The higher results from Clinique and Est e Lauder were primarily due to a favorable comparison to the higher level of prior-year period support spending behind launches such as New Dimension from Est e Lauder. The increase in operating income from La Mer reflected higher net sales.

    Makeup    

Makeup operating income decreased, reflecting lower results from M    A   C primarily due to a decrease in net sales.  These lower results were partially offset by higher results from Est e Lauder, Clinique, Tom Ford and Smashbox, reflecting higher net sales. 
     
    Fragrance    

Fragrance operating income increased, reflecting higher results from Jo Malone London and Est e Lauder reflecting higher net sales.  The higher results from Est e Lauder also reflected a favorable comparison to the higher level of prior-year period support spending behind launches such as Modern Muse Le Rouge.  Partially offsetting these higher results were lower results from Tom Ford reflecting higher investments behind new products.  
     
    Hair Care    

Hair care operating income increased, primarily reflecting higher results from Aveda due to effective expense management.  Operating results from Bumble and bumble also increased, reflecting higher net sales.

    Americas    

Operating income in the Americas decreased, primarily reflecting lower results from M    A   C due to a decrease in net sales.  Operating income was impacted by a decline in retail traffic in the United States related primarily to mid-tier department stores that principally affected Est e Lauder and M   A   C, as well as certain M   A   C freestanding stores in the United States, as a result of a decrease in tourism. 
     
    Europe, the Middle East   Africa    

In Europe, the Middle East   Africa, operating income increased, primarily reflecting higher results from our travel retail business and Switzerland of approximately $48 million, combined.  The higher results in our travel retail business reflected higher net sales.  The increased operating results in Switzerland were primarily due to a gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment.  These higher results were partially offset by lower results in the Middle East, France and the United Kingdom of approximately $33 million, combined.  The lower results in France were partially due to higher investment spending behind our makeup artist brands and certain of our heritage brands, as well as lower net sales due to a decline in tourism.  The lower results in the United Kingdom were driven by the negative impact of foreign currency.  
     
    Asia/Pacific    

Operating income increased in Asia/Pacific, reflecting higher results in Japan and China of approximately $12 million, combined, driven by constant currency sales growth.  The results in China also reflected a decrease in advertising, merchandising and sampling costs. These higher results were partially offset by lower results in Hong Kong due to lower net sales and, to a lesser extent, Australia of approximately $5 million, combined.  The lower results in Australia were due to higher selling and store operations costs attributable to increased distribution related to freestanding stores.

   INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME   

Interest expense increased as compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to higher short-and long-term debt levels.  Interest and investment income, net increased primarily due to higher cash and long-term investment balances, as well as from an increase in interest rates.  
     
   PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES   
     
  The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.  

The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a lower effective tax rate on our foreign operations, as well as a reduction in income tax reserves.

   RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES   
     
  We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  The following tables present Net Sales, Operating Income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring activities and the effects of foreign currency translation.  The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.  

The following table reconciles the change in net sales by product category and geographic region, as reported, to the change in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation:

    FINANCIAL CONDITION    
     
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
    Overview    
     
  Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.  At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $664 million compared with $914 million at June 30, 2016.  Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.  To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.  
     
  Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.  
     
  Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available-for-sale securities, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.  Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at September 30, 2016 include cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.  We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.  If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.  
     
  The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.  Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.  
     
    Credit Ratings    
     
  Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.  Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.  Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.  A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  As of October 26, 2016,  our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard   Poor s and P-1 by Moody s, and our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard   Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.

    Debt    
     
  At September 30, 2016, our outstanding borrowings were as follows:  

(1)                Consists of $450 million principal, net unamortized debt premium of $10 million and debt issuance costs of $5 million. 
  (2)                Consists of $250 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $1 million and debt issuance costs of $2 million. 
  (3)                Consists of $300 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $3 million and debt issuance costs of $4 million. 
  (4)                Consists of $200 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $2 million and debt issuance costs of $1 million. 
  (5)                Consists of $250 million principal, a $14 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of interest rate swaps and debt issuance costs of $1 million. 
  (6)                Consists of $450 million principal and debt issuance costs of $2 million. 
  (7)                Consists of $300 million principal and a $5 million adjustment to reflect the termination value of interest rate swaps. 
  (8)                The Senior Notes contain certain customary incurrence based covenants, including limitations on indebtedness secured by liens. 
     
  In October 2016, we increased the size of our commercial paper program to $1.5 billion (from $1.0 billion) under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States.  At October 26, 2016, we had $305 million of commercial paper outstanding, which we may refinance on a periodic basis, at then-prevailing market interest rates, as it matures.  
     
  In October 2016, we replaced our undrawn $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on July 15, 2020 (the  Prior Facility ) with a new $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on October 3, 2021, unless extended for up to two additional years in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement (the  New Facility ).  The New  Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.  Up to the equivalent of $500 million of the New Facility is available for multi-currency loans.  Interest rates on borrowings under the New Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement.  We incurred costs of approximately $1 million to establish the New Facility, which will be amortized over the term of the facility.  The New Facility has an annual fee of approximately $1 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.  The New Facility contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $175 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility. 
     
  Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 41% at September 30, 2016 from 39% at June 30, 2016, primarily due to the issuance of commercial paper.

    Cash Flows    

The decrease in cash flows from operations reflected an unfavorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.  This decrease also reflected a change in other accrued liabilities, partially reflecting the payment of accrued annual incentive employee compensation and a reduction in accrued income taxes due to the timing of payments.  Also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in inventory and a decrease in net earnings.  These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and collections, and a decrease in other assets primarily driven by a favorable change in prepaid taxes.  
     
  The decrease in net cash used for investing activities reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.  
     
  The decrease in net cash used for financing activities primarily reflected lower treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a change in short-term debt due to lower commercial paper borrowings in the current-year period.  
     
    Dividends    
     
  For a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11    Equity .  
     
    Pension and Post-retirement Plan Funding    
     
  There have been no significant changes to our pension and post-retirement funding as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  
     
    Commitments, Contractual Obligations and Contingencies    
     
  There have been no significant changes to our commitments and contractual obligations as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  For a discussion of contingencies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8    Contingencies .

    Market Risk    
     
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we changed our market risk assessment model from a value-at-risk model to a sensitivity based model. This sensitivity analysis utilizes hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates at the end of the reporting period to express the potential future losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors.  We believe this model provides greater insight into the impact of market risk exposures on our derivative instruments.

  We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $15 million and $22 million as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.  
     
  In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances.  Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by $14 million and $15 million as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  
     
  Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.  
     
   OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
     
  We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.  
     
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
     
  As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.  Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.  Since June 30, 2016, there have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to our critical accounting policies.

    CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION    
     
  We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.  The words and phrases  will likely result,   expect,   believe,   planned,   may,   should,   could,   anticipate,   estimate,   project,   intend,   forecast  or similar expressions are intended to identify  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements include our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating results.  Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation:  
     
  (1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses;  
     
  (2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend and to successfully address challenges in our business;  
     
  (3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry and other factors causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors or ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers and our inability to collect receivables;

  (9) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the United States;  
     
  (10) changes in global or local conditions, including those due to the volatility in the global credit and equity markets, natural or man-made disasters, real or perceived epidemics, or energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness or ability of consumers to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling, the financial strength of our customers, suppliers or other contract counterparties, our operations, the cost and availability of capital which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, the returns that we are able to generate on our pension assets and the resulting impact on funding obligations, the cost and availability of raw materials and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates;  
     
  (11) shipment delays, commodity pricing, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities that manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e. focus factories) or at our distribution or inventory centers, including disruptions that may be caused by the implementation of information technology initiatives, or by restructurings;

  (12) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase or maintain the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities;  
     
  (13) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable;  
     
  (14) our ability to acquire, develop or implement new information and distribution technologies and initiatives on a timely basis and within our cost estimates and our ability to maintain continuous operations of such systems and the security of data and other information that may be stored in such systems or other systems or media;  
     
  (15) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as publicly-announced strategies and restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom;  
     
  (16) consequences attributable to local or international conflicts around the world, as well as from any terrorist action, retaliation and the threat of further action or retaliation;

  We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements made herein or otherwise.  
     
   Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.      
     
  The information required by this item is set forth in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Market Risk  and is incorporated herein by reference.  
     
   Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.      
     
  (a)      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
     
  Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  The Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 and, based on their evaluation have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  
     
  (b)      Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
     
  As disclosed in Part II. Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain technology systems that are relevant to our financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.  
     
  Management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Our CEO and CFO have certified that, based on such officer s knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-Q.  In addition, we continue to implement the remediation plan for this material weakness as disclosed in Part II. Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, which is described below.  
     
 45   

Table of Contents   
     
   THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.   
     
  (c)       Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
     
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
     
  (d) Remediation Plan  
     
  Management is continuing to implement the remediation plan as disclosed in Part II. Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls will operate effectively.  
     
  We believe that these actions, and the improvements we expect to achieve as a result, will effectively remediate the material weakness.  However, the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.  We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed in fiscal 2017.  
     
   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION     
     
   Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.

   Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.      
     
   Share Repurchase Program   
     
  We are authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 216.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.  As of September 30, 2016, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 199.8 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 16.2 million.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased approximately 2.2 million shares pursuant to the authorization for $207 million as outlined in the following table:  

(1)                In November 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 40.0 million shares. 
  (2)                Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of stock-based compensation.
