2.   
       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies    

Our consolidated financial
statements include our accounts, as well as those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated results of operations
and financial position for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring natures. These unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended September 30, 2015
and the audited financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our Transition Report on Form
10-KT for the transition period from September 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015. 

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of
operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for any other interim period or for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Reclassification   

Certain
reclassifications have been made to conform the 2015 amounts to the 2016 classifications for comparative purposes.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SITO Mobile, Ltd. and it s wholly-owned subsidiaries,
SITO Mobile Solutions Inc., SITO Mobile R D IP, LLC, SITO Mobile Media Inc. and DoubleVision Networks Inc. ( DoubleVision ).
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The
Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include all stable, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less.  

Accounts
Receivable, net   

Accounts
receivable are reported at the customers  outstanding balances, less any allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not
accrued on overdue accounts receivable.

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   

An
allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance
for uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate to cover any probable losses. Management determines the
adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages and information collected from individual customers. Accounts
receivable are charged off against the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired.  

Property
and Equipment, net   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are charged to the asset accounts while replacements, maintenance
and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed. At the time property and equipment
are retired or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts.
Gains or losses from retirements or sales are credited or charged to income.  

Depreciation
is computed on the straight-line and accelerated methods for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes based upon
the following estimated useful lives:  

Software
    development  
      2-
    3 years   

Equipment
    and computer hardware  
      5
    years   

Office
    furniture  
      7
    years   

Leasehold
    Improvements  
      5
    years   

Long-Lived
Assets   

The
Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 360-10-05,
 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets
be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an
asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future
net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the
carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s carrying value and
fair value or disposable value.  

Capitalized
Software Development Costs   

The
Company accounts for costs incurred to develop or purchase computer software for internal use in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40
 Internal-Use Software.  As required by ASC 350-40, the Company capitalizes the costs incurred during the application
development stage, which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation, and testing.  

Costs
incurred during the preliminary project stage along with post-implementation stages of internal use computer software are expensed
as incurred. Capitalized development costs are amortized over a period of two to three years. Costs incurred to maintain existing
product offerings are expensed as incurred. The capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development costs requires
considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, technological and
economic feasibility, and estimated economic life.

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

Capital
Leases   

Assets
and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair
value of the leased assets. The assets are depreciated over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated productive
lives. Depreciation of the assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense.  

Debt
Issuance Costs   

Deferred
debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the related term of the debt and are presented on the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs is included in interest
expense.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  The method of accounting
for income taxes under ASC 740 is an asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting
bases of other assets and liabilities. The Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 or for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company recognizes income tax interest and
penalties as a separately identified component of general and administrative expense.  

Issuances
Involving Non-cash Consideration   

All
issuances of the Company s stock for non-cash consideration have been assigned a dollar amount equaling the market value
of the shares issued on the date the shares were issued for such services and property. The non-cash consideration paid pertains
to consulting services, the acquisition of a software license, the acquisition of DoubleVision Networks Inc. and assets purchased
from Hipcricket, Inc.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes media placement revenue based on the activity of mobile users viewing ads through developer applications and
mobile websites. Media placement revenues are recognized when the Company s advertising services are delivered based on
the specific terms of the advertising contract, which are commonly based on the number of ads delivered, or views, clicks or actions
by users on mobile advertisements. At such time, the Company s services have been provided, the fees charged are fixed or
determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and collectability is reasonably assured.  

The Company evaluates whether
it is appropriate to recognize media placement revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned
as revenue. When the Company is directly engaged with an advertising agency or brand, the Company is primarily obligated in a
transaction, has latitude in establishing prices, is responsible for fulfillment of the transaction, has credit risk, or has several
but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. While none of the factors individually are considered presumptive
or determinative, in reaching conclusions on gross versus net revenue recognition, the Company places the most weight on the analysis
of whether or not it is the primary obligor in the arrangement. When the Company is engaged with a sales partner who deals directly
with an agency or brand, the Company records the net amounts as media placement revenue earned if it is not primarily obligated
or does not have latitude in establishing prices or credit risk.

   Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

The
Company recognizes wireless applications revenue based on the delivery of Short Message Service (SMS) text messages and voice
messages and messaging program management services. Wireless applications revenues are recognized when the Company s services
are delivered based on the specific terms of the Company s contracts with customers, which are commonly based on the number
of messages delivered. At such time, the Company s services have been provided, the fees charged are fixed or determinable,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and collectability is reasonably assured.  

In
general, licensing and royalty revenue arrangements provide for the payment of contractually determined fees in consideration
for the patented technologies owned by or controlled by the Company s operating subsidiary. The intellectual property rights
granted may be perpetual in nature, extending until the expiration of the related patents, or can be granted for a defined, relatively
short period of time, with the licensee possessing the right to renew the agreement at the end of each contractual term for an
additional minimum upfront payment. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company s operating subsidiary may have
no further obligation with respect to the grant of the non-exclusive retroactive and future licenses, covenants-not-to-sue, releases,
and other deliverables, including no express or implied obligation on the Company s operating subsidiary s part to
maintain or upgrade the technology, or provide future support or services Generally, the agreements provide for the grant of licenses,
covenants-not-to-sue, releases, and other significant deliverables upon the execution of the agreement, or upon the receipt off
the minimum upfront payment for term agreement renewals. As such, when the Company has no further obligation under the agreement,
the earnings process is complete and revenue is recognized upon the execution of the agreement, when collectability is reasonably
assured, or upon receipt of the minimum upfront fee for term agreement renewals, and when all the other revenue recognition criteria
have been met, otherwise the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement based on the contractually
determined fees.  

Deferred
revenue arises as a result of differences between the timing of revenue recognition and receipt of cash from the Company s
customers.   

Stock
Based Compensation    

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC Topic 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director
services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. The Company records compensation
expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date.  

The
value of the stock-based award is determined using the Binomial or Black-Scholes option-pricing models, whereby compensation cost
is the excess of the fair value of the award as determined by the pricing model at the grant date or other measurement date over
the amount that must be paid to acquire the stock. The resulting amount is charged to expense on the straight-line basis over
the period in which the Company expects to receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting period.

Earnings
(Loss) per Share    

The
Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260-10,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings
(loss) per share are computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator
is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares
had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings per share has been presented for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 due to the Company s net income position for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

On
July 29, 2015, the Company filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-10 reverse split of its issued
and outstanding common stock the reverse split became effective in the market on July 30, 2015. Following the reverse split, every
ten shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined and converted into one issued and
outstanding share of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. No fractional shares are to be issued. As a result, all
prior per share calculations reflect the effects of this reverse stock split.  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk   

The
Company primarily transacts its business with one financial institution. The amount on deposit in that one institution may from

Of
the Company s revenue earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 17% was generated from contracts
with five customers covered under the Company s master services agreement with AT T and approximately 16% was generated
from contracts with an advertising agency. Of the Company s revenue earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2015,

The
Company s accounts receivable is typically unsecured and are derived from U.S. customers in different industries. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses. Historically, such
losses have been within management s expectations. As of September 30, 2016, and 2015, two customers accounted for 36% and
41%, respectively, of the Company s net accounts receivable balance, respectively.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Business
Combinations   

The
Company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, assets and liabilities
are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired,
net of liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets, liabilities
made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one year, are recorded as adjustments
to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Results of operations of the acquired
entity are included in the Company s results from the date of the acquisition onward and include amortization expense arising
from acquired tangible and intangible assets. The Company expenses all costs as incurred related to an acquisition under general
and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations.

original principal amount of $10,000,000 (the  Original Principal Amount ) and issued, pursuant to a Subscription
Agreement, 261,954 new shares of common stock to Fortress at $3.817 per share (which represents the trailing 30-day average closing

to the Investors, the Company received $8,850,000 before paying legal and due diligence expenses.  

The
principal amount of the Note bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 9% per annum. Such interest is payable in cash except

interest. The term of the Note is 42 months and the Company must make, beginning in October 2015, monthly amortization payments
on the Note, each in a principal amount equal to $333,334 until the Note is paid in full. The Company shall also apply 85% of
Monetization Revenues (as defined in the Agreement) from the Company s patents to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest
on, and then to repay outstanding principal (at par) of, the Note until all amounts due with respect to the Note have been paid
in full. After the repayment of the Note, in addition to interest, the Company shall pay the Revenue Participants up to 50% of
Monetization Revenues totaling (i) $5,000,000, if paid in full prior to March 31, 2018 and (ii) $7,500,000 thereafter (the  Revenue

       Related
    Party Transactions    

On
April 21, 2014 (the  Effective Date ), SITO Mobile R D IP, LLC, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, through
a joint venture arrangement organized as a limited liability company (the  JV ) with Personalized Media Communications,
LLC ( PMC ), entered into a Joint Licensing Program Agreement (the  Agreement ) with a national broadcasting
entity ( Licensee ) pursuant to which the JV granted the Licensee a term-limited license ( the  License )
to all patents licensable by the JV ( Patents ), including an exclusive license to assert the Patents against certain
infringing parties in the media distribution industry. In exchange for the License, the Licensee will pay an annual fee of $1,250,000
for a minimum of three years ( Annual Fee ). Commencing three years from the Effective Date, the Licensee may each
year, at its sole option, pay a $1,250,000 license fee to renew the License for every year for four additional years. Once the
Licensee has paid a total of $8,750,000 in license fees, either in one lump sum or after paying $1,250,000 annually for seven
years, the License is deemed to be perpetual. For Patents infringement actions provided for under the License, the Licensee will
pay 20% of the gross proceeds from settlements received less any Annual Fee amounts paid and litigation costs incurred ( Share
of Proceeds ). SITO Mobile R D IP, LLC and its joint venture partner will serve as co-plaintiffs with the Licensee in
infringement actions under the License and the Licensee will be responsible for any out-of-pocket costs of the JV associated with
being a co-plaintiff in supporting Licensee in such litigation, including attorneys  fees. The Licensee will pay the Annual
Fee and any Share of Proceeds to the JV. Proceeds received by the JV are shared by SITO Mobile R D IP, LLC and PMC on a 30%
and 70% basis, respectively. In the event that the Licensee does not assert any infringement actions under its rights in the License
within five years of the Effective Date, the JV may, at its sole option, choose to terminate Licensee s exclusive right
to assert infringement claims with no reduction or adjustment to the Annual Fee. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company amortized $94,262 and $280,738, respectively, in revenue. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has $209,016
in deferred revenue under the Licensing Agreement.  

The
Company s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities
approximate their fair values because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and
their expected realization. The Company determines the fair value of obligations under capital lease, notes payable and convertible
debentures based on the effective yields of similar obligations (Level 2).  

ASC
820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2)
an entity s own assumptions, about market participant assumptions, which are developed based on the best information available
in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820-10 are described below:  

Level
1. Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability
to access.  

Level
2. Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially
the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3. Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of
the assets or liabilities.

On
August 9, 2016, the Company approved a compensation plan for the quarter ending December 31, 2016 for the Executives which provides
for the payment of a cash bonus and an equity grant of performance options to the Company s Chief Executive Officer and
its Chief Financial Officer (the  Executives ). Each Executive was eligible for a quarterly cash bonus, based upon
net revenue, gross margins, and individual key performance indicators, set by the Company s Compensation Committee (the
 Target Performance ). The target bonus for the Chief Executive Officer was 50% of his base salary and for the Chief
Financial Officer, the target bonus was 40% of his base salary. The cash bonus was based upon the target net revenues and gross
margins of the Company. 70% of the target cash bonus was payable if threshold performance of 70% of the Target Performance is
achieved, 100% of the target cash bonus was payable if the Target Performance is reached, with 140% of the cash bonus paid if
140% of the Target Performance is achieved. As of September 30, 2016, there were no cash payouts for this incentive compensation
plan. The equity grant component of the compensation plan provided for the grant of 27,500 performance options to purchase shares
of common stock to the Chief Executive Officer and 12,500 performance options to purchase shares of common stock to the Chief
Financial Officer, with the number of performance options to be received by each of the Executives based upon the achievement
by the Company of certain net revenues and gross margins targets.  

On
August 9, 2016, the Company approved a compensation plan for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 for four employees of the Company
which provides for the payment of a cash bonus and an equity grant of performance options.  Three of the employees are eligible
for a quarterly cash bonus, based upon net revenue, and gross margins, set by the Company s Compensation Committee (the
 Target Performance ). The target bonus ranges from 20-30% of their base salary. Seventy percent of the cash bonus
is based upon the target net revenues and 30% of the cash bonus is based upon gross margins of the Company. 70% of the target
cash bonus will be paid if threshold performance of 70% of the Target Performance is achieved, 100% of the target cash bonus will
be paid if the Target Performance is reached, with 140% of the cash bonus paid if 140% of the Target Performance is achieved.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not accrued compensation expense for the potential incentive cash bonuses. The equity
grant component of the compensation plan provides for the grant of 6,250 performance options to purchase shares of Company common
stock to each of the four Employees, with the number of performance options to be received by each of the Employees based upon
the achievement by the Company of certain net revenues and gross margins targets.  

Since

Overview    

We
provide a mobile engagement platform that enables brands to increase awareness, loyalty, and ultimately sales.  

Our
business has focused on leveraging our solution in the areas of messaging/notifications and media placement on mobile devices.
Our Verified Walk-In platform is a proprietary attribution technology that utilizes geo-fencing to reach customers within a certain
radius of location and uses technology to push coupons, advertisements, and promotions to mobile apps and mobile websites in real-time,
allowing for a more accurate advertising approach. This technology identifies consumers who visit physical storefronts after seeing
advertisements that we distribute. This platform allows our clients to assess mobile-to-offline attribution allowing the ability
to quantify and measure the impact of campaigns on in-store visits, leveraging real-time insights on campaign performance through
key metrics such as user demographics, psychographics, visitation rates, click-through and time of engagement. Our Real-time Verified
Walk-In feature enables us and our customers to see advertising campaign results in real time, providing intelligence that is
quicker and more impactful than competitive offerings.  

Our
portfolio of intellectual property represents our many years  of innovation in the wireless industry through patented technology
that we developed, as well as patented technology we purchased from Microsoft and others. We are dedicated to the monetization
of our patents.

Results
of Operations   

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue increased by $5.8M, or 129%, to $10.3M for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $4.5M for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our revenue growth was primarily comprised of a $5.4M
or 179% increase in media placement revenue and a $0.4M or 33% increase in wireless application revenue. Media placement revenue
increased as a result of expanding our direct sales force and acquiring the mobile advertising business of Hipcricket, Inc. in
July 2015. In connection with transferring the management of text and voice messaging program of our largest customer under the
master services agreement with AT T back to the customer, we expect to receive $1.0M, of which we recognized $0.4M in the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and we will recognize $0.5M in the three months ending December 31, 2016  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, two customers accounted for 34% of the Company s revenue, which comprised of
17% from contracts with five customers covered under the Company s master services agreement with AT T, and 17% from
multiple advertising contracts under one media placement customer. Of our revenue earned during the quarter ended September 30,
2015, approximately 29% of the Company s revenue was generated from contracts with six customers covered under our agreements
with AT T.  

Our
cost of revenue, which represents the costs associated with wireless applications and media placement revenues, increased by $2.4M
or 115% to $4.6M for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $2.2M for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Our cost of revenue is substantially in line with media placement and wireless application revenues, and includes depreciation
and amortization expense of our mobile engagement technology platforms that we use to operate our wireless applications and media
placement business. This increase in our cost of revenue is primarily the result of a 129% increase in revenue over the same period.
Our technology investment in revenue growth is focused on our mobile engagement platform through software development efforts.
We capitalize the cost of developing our mobile engagement platform and amortize our investment over three years. For the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.3M and $0.2M, respectively, in amortization of software development
costs due to the increase investment in developing our platform.  

General and administrative expense,
excluding stock based compensation, decreased by $0.6M, or 28%, to $1.5M for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $2.0M during the same period in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to non-recurring fees related to the HipCricket acquisition
in July 2015, in addition to continued streamlining of the business. 

Sales and marketing expense, which
excludes stock based compensation, increased by $1.5M, or 134%, to $2.7M for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $1.2M for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to the expansion of our direct
sales force and customer management personnel in connection with our media placement business which launched in December 2013
and expanded by acquiring Hipcricket s mobile advertising business in July 2015. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing
expense was 27% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the same period ended in 2015. Our media placement revenues
have carried relatively higher spending levels than our wireless application revenue. Sales and marketing expense has increased
as media placement revenue has grown, but has decreased to 33% of total media placement revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to 40% during the same period in 2015. We anticipate that sales and marketing expense as a percentage of
media placement revenue will continue to decrease as our expanded sales force generates more sales. 

24  

For the three months ended September
30, 2016, total stock based compensation expense increased by $0.2M, or 83% to $0.4M as compared to $0.2M for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, excluding stock-based compensation issued to vendors for services. This is due to the grants of options
to additional members of management in 2016 and the non-recurring stock based compensation for vendor services in 2015. 

Interest expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $0.1M, or 8% to approximately $0.4M as compared to approximately $0.5M for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. In October 2014, we sold a secured $10,000,000 42-month note having an interest rate
of 9% plus the greater of LIBOR, which was 0.52% as of September 30, 2016, rounded to 1%. Included in interest expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 is $0.2M in amortization of discounts on the debt for a structuring fee, termination fees,
and the rights assigned to Fortress to share in our potential future new intellectual property monetization revenue streams. 

Our net income for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $0.5M as compared to a net loss of $2.6M for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily
attributable to the $3.3M increase in gross profits and a non-recurring $0.8M impairment expense for the three months ended September
30, 2015. These were offset by an increase of $1.6M in sales and marketing expense. Excluding stock based compensation, our net
income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $0.9M as compared to a net loss of $2.4M for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Our net income was $0.03 per basic share
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 based on our weighted average shares outstanding of 17.4M on September 30, 2016 as
compared to a net loss of $0.16 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2015 based on our weighted average shares outstanding
of 16.4M for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our net income on a fully diluted basis was $0.03 per share for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 based on our weighted average shares outstanding of 19.5M on September 30, 2016. The increase in
the number of weighted shares outstanding primarily reflects the issuance of shares of common stock, of which 3.1M shares were
issued in connection with a new shelf registration, 0.8M shares were issued for warrants which were exercised, and 0.2M shares
were issued to Fortress for the restructuring of debt. 

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue increased by $14.8M or 123%, to $26.7M as compared to $12M during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Our revenue growth was primarily comprised of a $14.8M or 217 % increase in media placement revenue.
Media placement revenue increased as a result of expanding our direct sales force and acquiring Hipcricket s mobile advertising
business in July 2015. During the first half of fiscal 2015, one of our largest customers under our master services agreement
with AT T transitioned its database of customers who receive our messages to a new standard rate messaging program and the
transition caused a decline in the number of customers who elected to continue to receive messages.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, two customers accounted for 33% of the Company s revenue, which comprised of 17%
from contracts with five customers covered under the Company s master services agreement with AT T, and 16% from multiple
advertising contracts under one media placement customer. Of our revenue earned during the nine months ended September 31, 2015,
approximately 38% was generated from contracts with six customers covered under our agreements with AT T.  

Our
cost of revenue, which represents the costs associated with wireless applications and media placement revenues, increased by $6.5M
or 116 % to $12.1M for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $5.6M for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Our cost of revenue varies substantially in line with wireless applications and media placement revenues and includes depreciation
and amortization expense of our mobile engagement technology platforms that we use to operate our wireless applications and media
placement business. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 primarily as result of the 123% increase in revenue over the same comparable periods and a $0.3M increase in
software development amortization expense. Our technology investment in revenue growth is focused on our mobile engagement platform
through software development efforts. We capitalize the cost of developing our mobile engagement platform and amortize our investment
over three years. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.8M and $0.5M, respectively, in
amortization of software development costs, with the increased amortization attributable to the increased investment in developing
our platform.  

25  

General
and administrative expense, excluding stock based compensation, remained consistent at $4.4M for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $4.4M for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Sales and
marketing expense, excluding stock based compensation, increased by $4.4M, or 154%, to $7.3M for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $2.9M for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to the expansion
of our direct sales force and customer management personnel in connection with our media placement business that we launched in
December 2013 and expanded by acquiring Hipcricket s mobile advertising business in July 2015. As a percentage of revenue,
sales and marketing expense was 28% and 25% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our media placement
revenues have carried relatively higher spending levels than our wireless application revenues. Sales and marketing expense has
increased as media placement revenue has grown, but has decreased to 35% of total media placement revenue in the current quarter
as compared to 43% during the same period in 2015. We anticipate that sales and marketing expense as a percentage of media placement
revenue will continue to decrease as our newly expanded direct sales force generates more sales. 

For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, total stock based compensation expense increased by $0.5M or 142% to $0.9M from $0.4M for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluding stock-based compensation issued for vendor services. The increase is primarily
attributable to our granting directors their annual option grants at our February 2016 annual meeting of shareholders rather than
on their respective anniversary dates as was done previously, the addition of a new director and his grant of options, in addition
to options granted to management. 

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 remained consistent at $1.3M and $1.3M, respectively. In October
2014, we sold a secured $10,000,000 42-month note having an interest rate of 9% plus the greater of LIBOR, which was 0.52% as
of September 30, 2016, rounded to 1%. Included in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are $0.6M
and $0.5M, respectively, in amortization of discounts on the debt for a structuring fee, termination fees and the rights assigned
to Fortress to share in our potential future new intellectual property monetization revenue streams.  

Our net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 of $4.0M decreased by $4.0M, or 101% to a net income of $0.1M for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
This decrease is primarily attributable to the $4.4M increase in sales and marketing expense and $0.5M increase in stock compensation
expense that was offset by the $8.2M increase in gross profits and a $0.8M non-recurring impairment expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Excluding stock based compensation, our net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016
was $1.0M and net loss of $3.6M for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Our net income on a basic and fully diluted
basis was $0.00 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 based on our weighted average shares outstanding of 17.7M
and 19.7M respectively, as compared to a net loss of $0.25 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 based on our
weighted average shares outstanding of 15.7M. The increase in the number of weighted shares outstanding primarily reflects the
issuance of shares of common stock, of which 3.1M shares were issued in connection with an underwritten public offering, 0.8M
shares were issued for warrants which were exercised, 0.2M shares were issued to Fortress, 0.3M were issued to DoubleVision in
satisfaction of the earnout provision, 0.6M shares were issued for the acquisition of Hipcricket s mobile advertising business. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At September 30, 2016, we had total
assets of $31.7M including $19.9M in current assets, and total liabilities of $13.9M, including $9.3M in current liabilities. At
December 31, 2015, we had total assets of $20.8M, including $8.9M in current assets, and total liabilities of $15.6M, including
$10.6M in current liabilities. The $10.9M or 53% increase in assets consisted of a $7.2M increase in cash due to the sale and issuance
of 3.1M shares of common stock in September 2016 in an underwritten public offering. Additionally, increased revenues led to an
increase of $3.6M in receivables. The $1.6M or 11% decrease in liabilities is primarily attributable to the decrease in current
liabilities that largely consisted of a $1.8M decrease for the Fortress Loan, a $0.4M decrease in accounts payable due to use of
cash proceeds for operations, offset by an increase in accrued expense of $0.7M attributable to the growth in our costs of revenue
and operations that resulted from the expansion of our business. 

26  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, we used $2.0M in cash for operating activities, of which $1.5M is the net positive result of our noncash expenses primarily
consisting of $0.7M in depreciation and amortization expense, $0.4M in stock compensation expense, and $0.1 of bad debt expense.
In addition, we used $1.0M in cash for growth in our accounts receivable in the three-month period which has resulted from increased
media placement revenue that typically remains outstanding in accounts receivable longer than our wireless applications revenue.
$2.4M was also used in accounts payable for the three month-month period that reflected our plan to strategically reduce outstanding
balances with our advertising inventory suppliers to create more buying capacity and flexibility in anticipation of media placement
revenue growth.  

Cash
used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.4M, of which $0.3M primarily represents capitalized
internal costs of our software development for our advertising technology platform. $0.1M was attributable to investments in our
intellectual property which is designed to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and purchases of property and equipment
in connection with our personnel expansion.  

Cash
provided in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.5M which is primarily comprised of $11.0M
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in September 2016 and $0.5M in principal repayment our Note to Fortress. On March
1, 2016, we amended our Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement with Fortress to reduce monthly principal payments from $333,333
to $175,000 for February 2016 through February 2017 and from $333,333 to $300,000 for March 2017 to February 2018, with the final
payment in March 2018 increased to repay the remaining principal in full. In consideration for the Amendment, we paid a restructuring
fee and issued shares of our common stock to Fortress as described in the discussion of the cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 below.  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we used $0.6M in cash for operating activities, of which $3.2M is the net positive result of our noncash expenses of
$1.9M in depreciation and amortization expense, $0.9M in stock compensation expense, and $0.3M of bad debt expense. In addition,
we used $4.0M in cash for growth in our accounts receivable in the nine-month period which has resulted from increased media placement
revenue, which typically remains outstanding in accounts receivable longer than our wireless applications revenue and we used $0.4M
in cash for our accounts payable in the nine-month period that reflects operating cost growth in line with our revenue growth and
an increase in accounts payable aging that brings our vendor and customer balance aging into better alignment. These were offset
by an increase of $0.7M in accrued expenses due primarily to annual incentive plans ending September 30, 2016. 

Cash
used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.2M, of which $1.1M primarily represents capitalized
internal costs of our software development for our advertising technology platform. The remaining $0.1M was attributable to investments
in our intellectual property which is designed to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and for purchases of property
and equipment in connection with our personnel expansion.  

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $9.0M, which primarily consisted of $11.0M
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in September 2016 and $1.9M in principal repayments on our Note to Fortress. On
March 1, 2016, we amended our Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement with Fortress to reduce monthly principal payments from
$333,333 to $175,000 for February 2016 through February 2017 and from $333,333 to $300,000 for March 2017 to February 2018, with
the final payment in March 2018 increased to repay the remaining principal in full. In consideration for the Amendment, we paid
a restructuring fee of $100,000 and issued 200,000 shares of our common stock, with an aggregate value of $0.6M, to Fortress.   

The
principal amount of our Note to Fortress bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 9% per annum. Such interest is payable monthly
in cash except that 2% per annum of the interest shall be paid-in-kind, by increasing the principal amount of the Note by the
amount of such interest. The term of the Note is 42 months and we began making monthly interest payments in October 2014. In October
2015, we began making monthly amortization payments on the Note, each in the amount of $333,334. We agreed to apply 85% of any
revenues from new licensing and royalty arrangements that we generate using our patents ( Monetization Revenues )
to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on, and then to repay outstanding principal (at par) of, the Note until all amounts
due with respect to the Note has been paid in full. After the repayment of the Note, we will pay Fortress up to 50% of Monetization
Revenues totaling (i) $5,000,000, if paid in full prior to March 31, 2018 and (ii) $7,500,000 thereafter. In addition, we must
also pay $350,000 to Fortress upon repayment of the Note.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements or financing activities with special purpose entities.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. We have identified the following accounting policies that we believe are key to an understanding of our
financial statements. These are important accounting policies that require management s most difficult, subjective judgments.  

Revenue
Recognition and Deferred Revenue   

The Company recognizes media placement
revenue based on the activity of mobile users viewing ads through developer applications and mobile websites. Media placement revenues
are recognized when the Company s advertising services are delivered based on the specific terms of the advertising
contract, which are commonly based on the number of ads delivered, or views, clicks or actions by users on mobile advertisements.
At such time, the Company s services have been provided, the fees charged are fixed or determinable, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, and collectability is reasonably assured. 

The Company evaluates whether it
is appropriate to recognize media placement revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned
as revenue.  When the Company is directly engaged with an advertising agency or brand, the Company is primarily obligated
in a transaction, has latitude in establishing prices, is responsible for fulfillment of the transaction, has credit
risk, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. While none of the factors individually
are considered presumptive or determinative, in reaching conclusions on gross versus net revenue recognition, the Company places the
most weight on the analysis of whether or not it is the primary obligor in the arrangement. When the Company is engaged with
a sales partner who deals directly with an agency or brand, the Company records the net amounts as media placement revenue earned
if it is not primarily obligated or does not have latitude in establishing prices or credit risk. 

The
Company recognizes wireless applications revenue based on the delivery of Short Message Service (SMS) text messages
and voice messages and messaging program management services. Wireless applications revenues are recognized when the Company s
services are delivered based on the specific terms of the Company s contracts with customers, which are commonly based on
the number of messages delivered. At such time, the Company s services have been provided, the fees charged
are fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and collectability is reasonably assured.  

In
general, licensing and royalty revenue arrangements provide for the payment of contractually determined fees in consideration
for the patented technologies owned by or controlled by the Company s operating subsidiary. The intellectual property rights
granted may be perpetual in nature, extending until the expiration of the related patents, or can be granted for a defined, relatively
short period of time, with the licensee possessing the right to renew the agreement at the end of each contractual term for an
additional minimum upfront payment. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company s operating subsidiary may have
no further obligation with respect to the grant of the non-exclusive retroactive and future licenses, covenants-not-to-sue, releases,
and other deliverables, including no express or implied obligation on the Company s operating subsidiary s part to
maintain or upgrade the technology, or provide future support or services. Generally, the agreements provide for the grant of
licenses, covenants-not-to-sue, releases, and other significant deliverables upon the execution of the agreement, or upon the
receipt off the minimum upfront payment for term agreement renewals. As such, when the Company has no further obligation under
the agreement, the earnings process is complete and revenue is recognized upon the execution of the agreement, when collectability
is reasonably assured, or upon receipt of the minimum upfront fee for term agreement renewals, and when all the other revenue
recognition criteria have been met, otherwise the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement
based on the contractually determined fees.  

28  

Deferred
revenue arises as a result of differences between the timing of revenue recognition and receipt of cash from the Company s
customers.   

Software
Development Costs   

The
Company accounts for costs incurred to develop or purchase computer software for internal use in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40
 Internal-Use Software.  As required by ASC 350-40, the Company capitalizes the costs incurred during
the application development stage, which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation,
and testing.  

Costs
incurred during the preliminary project stage along with post-implementation stages of internal use computer software are expensed
as incurred. Capitalized development costs are amortized over a period of two to three years. Costs incurred to maintain existing
product offerings are expensed as incurred. The capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development costs requires
considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, technological and
economic feasibility, and estimated economic life.  

Long-Lived
Assets   

We
account for our long-lived assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 360-10-05,  Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer
be appropriate. We assess recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to
result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset,
an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s carrying value and fair value or disposable value.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $831,000 on our   Anywhere  Software
License.   

Fair
Value Measurement   

The
Company complies with the provisions of ASC No. 820-10 (ASC 820-10),   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . 
ASC 820-10 relates to financial assets and financial liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions.  

ASC
820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2)
an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions that are developed based on the best information available
in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820-10 are described below:  

Level
1. Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.  

29  

Level
2. Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3. Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of
the assets or liabilities.  

Item
4 - Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The
Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and
(2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

We
have not made a change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Internal
control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even a system which is determined
to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal
controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  

Under
the oversight of the Audit Committee, Management will continue to review and make any changes it deems necessary to the overall
design of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, including implementing improvements in policies and procedures.
We are committed to a proper internal control environment and will continue to implement measures to improve the Company s
internal control over financial reporting in response to our continued operational development.
