  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  1. Description of the Company and Basis of Presentation 
  Description of the Company 
  Celanese Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") is a global technology and specialty materials company. The Company's business involves processing chemical raw materials, such as methanol, carbon monoxide and ethylene, and natural products, including wood pulp, into value-added chemicals, thermoplastic polymers and other chemical-based products. 
  Definitions 
  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The term "Celanese US" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   contained in this Quarterly Report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") for all periods presented and include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report, unless otherwise specified, have been presented to separately show the effects of discontinued operations. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited interim consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and equity include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with US GAAP. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP may have been condensed or omitted in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed on   February 5, 2016   with the SEC as part of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Operating results for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements relative to a number of topics, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, supply agreements, product sales and other arrangements. The Company endeavors to describe those contracts or agreements that are material to its business, results of operations or financial position. The Company may also describe some arrangements that are not material but in which the Company believes investors may have an interest or which may have been included in a Form 8-K filing. Investors should not assume the Company has described all contracts and agreements relative to the Company's business in this Quarterly Report. 
  For those consolidated ventures in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than   100%   of the economics, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interests. 
  The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. 
  Estimates and Assumptions 
  The preparation of unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension  
  
    8 

Table of Contents  

and other postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations, environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its reporting unit goodwill either qualitatively or quantitatively annually during the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. In connection with the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company did not record an impairment loss to goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the estimated fair value for each of the Company's reporting units exceeded the carrying amount of the underlying assets by a substantial margin. 
  The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its indefinite-lived intangible assets either qualitatively or by utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach annually during the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. In connection with the Company's annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment, the Company did not record an impairment loss to indefinite-lived intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the estimated fair value of each of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the carrying value of the underlying assets by a substantial margin. 
  The Company's trademarks and trade names have an indefinite life. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not renew or extend any intangible assets. 
  Change in estimate regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 
  Beginning in 2016, the Company elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost will be completely offset in the annual actuarial (gain) loss reported. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2016. The Company's adoption of the full yield curve approach will reduce 2016 service and interest cost by approximately   $29 million   as compared to the previous method. 
  The discount rates used to measure service and interest cost during 2016 and the discount rates that would have been used for service and interest cost under the Company's previous estimation methodology are as follows:

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 840,   Leases  , resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ("ASU 2015-17"). ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 prospectively during the three months ended March 31, 2016 in accordance with the FASB's disclosure simplification initiatives. The adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification from current to noncurrent deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2016 of   $68 million   and   $30 million  , respectively. Prior periods were not adjusted. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09")  .   ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU provides alternative methods of adoption. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from     Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date   ("ASU 2015-14"). ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after that date and permits early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Since that date, the FASB has issued additional ASUs clarifying certain aspects of ASU 2014-09. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 was not changed by the additional guidance. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

3. Ventures and Variable Interest Entities 
  Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
  In February 2014, the Company formed a joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC ("Fairway"), with Mitsui   Co., Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan ("Mitsui"), in which the Company owns   50%   of Fairway, for the production of methanol at the Company's integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. The methanol unit utilizes natural gas in the US Gulf Coast region as a feedstock and benefits from the existing infrastructure at the Company's Clear Lake facility. Both Mitsui and the Company supply their own natural gas to Fairway in exchange for methanol tolling under a cost-plus off-take arrangement. 
  The Company determined that Fairway is a variable interest entity ("VIE") in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Under the terms of the joint venture agreements, the Company provides site services and day-to-day operations for the methanol facility. In addition, the joint venture agreements provide that the Company indemnifies Mitsui for environmental obligations that exceed a specified threshold, as well as an equity option between the partners. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the venture and records a noncontrolling interest for the share of the venture owned by Mitsui. Fairway is included in the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment. 
  The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities associated with Fairway included in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets are as follows:   
 ______________________________ 
            (1)   
    Assets can only be used to settle the obligations of Fairway. 
               (2)   
    Primarily represents amounts owed by Fairway to the Company for reimbursement of expenditures. 
     Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities 
  The Company holds variable interests in entities that supply certain raw materials and services to the Company. The variable interests primarily relate to cost-plus contractual arrangements with the suppliers and recovery of capital expenditures for certain plant assets plus a rate of return on such assets. Liabilities for such supplier recoveries of capital expenditures have been recorded as capital lease obligations. The entities are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entities as it does not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   relates primarily to the recovery of capital expenditures for certain property, plant and equipment.

The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities associated with the obligations to nonconsolidated VIEs, as well as the maximum exposure to loss relating to these nonconsolidated VIEs are as follows:   

  The difference between the total liabilities associated with obligations to unconsolidated VIEs and the maximum exposure to loss primarily represents take-or-pay obligations for services included in the Company's unconditional purchase obligations (   Note 16   ). 
   
  4. Marketable Securities, at Fair Value 
  The Company's nonqualified trusts hold available-for-sale securities for funding requirements of the Company's nonqualified pension plans (   Note 9   ) as follows:

Senior Credit Facilities 
  On July 15, 2016, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiaries entered into a new senior credit agreement ("New Credit Agreement") consisting of a   $500 million   senior unsecured term loan and a   $1.0 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), each maturing in 2021. The proceeds from the new senior unsecured term loan and   $409 million   of borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were used to repay the Company's Term C-2 and C-3 loans under its existing senior secured credit facilities. The New Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese US and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). 
  In connection with entering into the New Credit Agreement, the Company recorded deferred financing costs of   $5 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which are being amortized through 2021. The Company accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and other expenses of   $4 million   related to the senior secured credit facilities, which are included in Refinancing expense in the unaudited interim consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  The Company's debt balances and amounts available for borrowing under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility are as follows:

    The Company borrowed   $409 million   and repaid   $411 million   under its new senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company borrowed   $245 million   and repaid   $595 million   under its previous secured revolving credit facility during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
               (2)   
    The margin for borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility was   1.5%   above LIBOR. 
     Senior Notes 
  The Company has outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), as amended (collectively, the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US and are guaranteed by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. 
  On September 26, 2016, Celanese US completed an offering of    750 million   in principal amount of 1.125% senior unsecured notes due September 26, 2023 (the "1.125% Notes") in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 1.125% Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The 1.125% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of   99.713%  , which is being amortized to Interest expense in the unaudited interim consolidated statements of operations over the term of the 1.125% Notes. Net proceeds from the sale of the 1.125% Notes were used to repay   $411 million   of outstanding borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Deferred financing costs of   $6 million   were recorded during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which are being amortized over the term of the 1.125% Notes. 
  Pollution Control and Industrial Revenue Bonds 
  On March 3, 2016, the State of Wisconsin Public Finance Authority completed an offering of pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were loaned to Celanese US and used to repay the pollution control and industrial revenue bonds previously issued for the benefit of the Company. In connection with the refinancing, the Company recorded deferred financing costs of   $2 million   during the three months ended March 31, 2016, which are being amortized over the terms of the bonds. The Company accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and other expenses of   $2 million   related to the refinancing, which are included in Refinancing expense in the unaudited interim consolidated statements of operations.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility 
  The Company has a US accounts receivable securitization facility involving receivables of certain of its domestic subsidiaries of the Company transferred to a wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary of the Company ("SPE"). The securitization facility, which permits cash borrowings and letters of credit, was scheduled to expire on August 28, 2016, but may be extended for successive one year terms by agreement of the parties. All of the SPE's assets have been pledged to the administrative agent in support of the SPE's obligations under the facility. On July 8, 2016, certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into an amendment of the accounts receivable securitization facility ("Amendment"), extending its maturity to July 2019 and decreasing the available amount to   $120 million  . 
  The Company's debt balances and amounts available for borrowing under its securitization facility are as follows:

     Covenants 
  The Company's material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants related to its debt agreements as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  9. Benefit Obligations 
  Beginning in 2016, the Company elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows (   Note 1   ). The Company's adoption of the full yield curve approach will reduce 2016 service and interest cost by approximately   $29 million   as compared to the previous method.

  10. Environmental 
  The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations worldwide that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and impose record keeping and notification requirements. Failure to timely comply with these laws and regulations may expose the Company to penalties. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and engages in an on going process of updating its controls to mitigate compliance risks. The Company is also subject to retained environmental obligations specified in various contractual agreements arising from the divestiture of certain businesses by the Company or one of its predecessor companies. 
  
    17 

Table of Contents  

The components of environmental remediation reserves are as follows:   

  Remediation 
  Due to its industrial history and through retained contractual and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on divested, demerger, orphan or US Superfund sites (as defined below). In addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the Company and Hoechst AG ("Hoechst"), a specified portion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Company (   Note 16   ). The Company provides for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company believes that environmental remediation costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given period. 
  US Superfund Sites 
  In the US, the Company may be subject to substantial claims brought by US federal or state regulatory agencies or private individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In particular, the Company has a potential liability under the US Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws (collectively referred to as "Superfund") for investigation and cleanup costs at certain sites. At most of these sites, numerous companies, including the Company, or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the US Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), state governing bodies or private individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible parties ("PRP") under Superfund or related laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites, and the status of the insurance coverage for some of these proceedings is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot accurately determine its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs at these sites. 
  As events progress at each site for which it has been named a PRP, the Company accrues, as appropriate, a liability for site cleanup. Such liabilities include all costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In establishing these liabilities, the Company considers its shipment of waste to a site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company joins with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that settle, among PRPs, each party's percentage allocation of costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most current information available. 
  One such site is the Lower Passaic River Study Area, which is the lower 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River ("Site"). The Company and   70   other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") at the Site in order to identify the levels of contaminants and potential cleanup actions. Work on the RI/FS is ongoing, with a goal to complete it in 2017. 
  On March 3, 2016, the EPA issued its final Record of Decision concerning the remediation of the lower 8.3 miles of the Site ("Lower 8.3 Miles"). The Company owned and/or operated facilities in the vicinity of the Lower 8.3 Miles, but has found no evidence that it contributed any of the primary contaminants of concern to the Passaic River. Pursuant to the EPA's Record of Decision, the Lower 8.3 Miles must be dredged bank to bank and an engineered cap must be installed at an estimated cost of approximately   $1.4 billion  . The Company is vigorously defending this matter and currently believes that its ultimate allocable share of the cleanup costs, estimated at less than   1%  , will not be material.

  Common Stock 
  The Company's Board of Directors follows a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company's Series A common stock, par value   $0.0001   per share ("Common Stock"), unless the Company's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. 
  The Company's Board of Directors approved increases in the Company's Common Stock cash dividend rates as follows:

    These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program began in February 2008 and does not have an expiration date. 
     The purchase of treasury stock reduces the number of shares outstanding. The repurchased shares may be used by the Company for compensation programs utilizing the Company's stock and other corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders' equity.

     2016 
  During the   nine months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded   $11 million   and   $20 million  , respectively, of employee termination benefits primarily related to the Company's ongoing efforts to align its businesses around its core value drivers. 
  2015 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded   $6 million   and   $4 million  , respectively, in accelerated depreciation related to the Company's vinyl acetate ethylene ("VAE") emulsions unit in Meredosia, Illinois and its VAE and conventional emulsions units in Tarragona, Spain. The accelerated depreciation is included in Cost of sales in the unaudited interim consolidated statements of operations and is included in the Company's Industrial Specialties segment. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company also recorded   $39 million   in accelerated depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment no longer in use at the Company's ethanol technology development unit in Clear Lake, Texas. The Company believes that further development of its ethanol technology can be achieved through the utilization of other existing assets. The accelerated depreciation is included in Research and development expenses in the unaudited interim consolidated statements of operations and is included in the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment. 
  The changes in the restructuring reserves by business segment are as follows:

13. Income Taxes   

  The   lower   effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to remeasurement of prior year tax positions due to audit closures and technical clarifications in certain jurisdictions of   $52 million  . 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company's uncertain tax positions decreased   $61 million  , primarily due to audit closures in the US and in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
  The Company's US tax returns for the years 2009 through 2012 are currently under audit by the US Internal Revenue Service and certain of the Company's subsidiaries are under audit in jurisdictions outside of the US. In connection with the Company's US federal income tax audit for 2009 and 2010, the Company has received   $192 million   of proposed pre-tax adjustments related to various intercompany charges. In the event the Company is wholly unsuccessful in its defense, an actual tax assessment would result in the consumption of up to   $67 million   of prior foreign tax credit carryforwards. The Company believes these proposed adjustments to be without merit and is vigorously defending its position. 
   
  14. Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  Cross-currency Swaps 
  In March 2015, the Company settled its cross-currency swap agreements with notional values of   $250 million  /   193 million  , expiring   September 11, 2020  , and   $225 million  /   162 million  , expiring   April 17, 2019  , in exchange for cash of   $88 million  . The Company recorded a net loss of   $1 million  , which is included in Other income (expense), net in the unaudited interim consolidated statement of operations. The Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the same category of the consolidated statement of cash flows as the cash flows from the items being hedged. Accordingly, the settlement of the cross-currency swap agreements is included in Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the unaudited interim consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Net Investment Hedges 
  The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forwards, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency denominated debt, that may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains or losses to hedge the foreign currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses from remeasurement of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments is included in foreign currency translation within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged investment is sold or liquidated. 
  The total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge of net investments in foreign operations are as follows:

15. Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company's financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as follows: 
  Derivatives.   Derivative financial instruments, including commodity swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps, are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement inputs such as spot rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for commodity swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are observable in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.

     Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are as follows:   

  In general, the cost investments included in the table above are not publicly traded and their fair values are not readily determinable; however, the Company believes the carrying values approximate or are less than the fair values. Insurance contracts in nonqualified trusts consist of long-term fixed income securities, which are valued using independent vendor pricing models with observable inputs in the active market and therefore represent a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of

Table of Contents  

long-term debt is based on valuations from third-party banks and market quotations and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The fair value of obligations under capital leases, which are included in long-term debt, is based on lease payments and discount rates, which are not observable in the market and therefore represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payables, short-term borrowings and the current installments of long-term debt approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These items have been excluded from the table with the exception of the current installments of long-term debt. 
   
  16. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Commitments 
  Guarantees 
  The Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements, leases, settlement agreements and various agreements with affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, others do not provide such limitations. The Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims. These known obligations include the following: 
             
    Demerger Obligations 
     In connection with the Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, for various liabilities under the demerger agreement, including for environmental liabilities associated with contamination arising either from environmental damage in general ("Category A") or under   19   divestiture agreements entered into by Hoechst prior to the demerger ("Category B") (   Note 10   ). 
  The Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, is capped under Category B at    250 million  . If and to the extent the environmental damage should exceed    750 million   in aggregate, the Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors applies, but is then limited to   33.33%   of the remediation cost without further limitations. Cumulative payments under the divestiture agreements as of   September 30, 2016   are   $74 million  . Most of the divestiture agreements have become time barred and/or any notified environmental damage claims have been partially settled. 
  The Company has also undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for (i)   33.33%   of any and all Category A liabilities that result from Hoechst being held as the responsible party pursuant to public law or current or future environmental law or by third parties pursuant to private or public law related to contamination and (ii) liabilities that Hoechst is required to discharge, including tax liabilities, which are associated with businesses that were included in the demerger but were not demerged due to legal restrictions on the transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not been requested by Hoechst to make any payments in connection with this indemnification. Accordingly, the Company has not made any payments to Hoechst and its legal successors. 
  Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the lack of requests for indemnification, the Company cannot estimate the Possible Loss for the remaining demerger obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. 
             
    Divestiture Obligations 
     The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees represent standard contractual terms associated with typical divestiture agreements and, other than environmental liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the Company to any significant risk (   Note 10   ). 
  The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, which extend through   2037  . The aggregate amount of outstanding indemnifications and guarantees provided for under these agreements is   $202 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Other agreements do not provide for any monetary or time limitations.

Table of Contents  

Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the number of requests for indemnification or other payment received by the Company, the Company cannot estimate the Possible Loss for the remaining divestiture obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. 
  Purchase Obligations 
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various purchase commitments for goods and services. The Company maintains a number of "take-or-pay" contracts for purchases of raw materials, utilities and other services. Certain of the contracts contain a contract termination buy-out provision that allows for the Company to exit the contracts for amounts less than the remaining take-or-pay obligations. The Company does not expect to incur any material losses under take-or-pay contractual arrangements. Additionally, the Company has other outstanding commitments representing maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts and software agreements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of   $2.6 billion  , which extend through   2036  . 
  Contingencies 
  The Company is involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of business, relating to such matters as product liability, land disputes, commercial contracts, employment, antitrust, intellectual property, workers' compensation, chemical exposure, asbestos exposure, taxes, trade compliance, prior acquisitions and divestitures, claims of legacy stockholders, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment. The Company is actively defending those matters where the Company is named as a defendant and, based on the current facts, does not believe the outcomes from these matters would be material to our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

19. Consolidating Guarantor Financial Information 
  The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US ("Issuer") and are guaranteed by Celanese Corporation ("Parent Guarantor") and the Subsidiary Guarantors (   Note 8   ). The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors are   100%   owned subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. The Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors have guaranteed the Notes fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally. 
  For cash management purposes, the Company transfers cash between the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors and non-guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Company's outstanding debt, Common Stock dividends and Common Stock repurchases. The unaudited interim consolidating statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   present such intercompany financing activities, contributions and dividends consistent with how such activity would be presented in a stand-alone statement of cash flows. 
  The Company has not presented separate financial information and other disclosures for each of its Subsidiary Guarantors because it believes such financial information and other disclosures would not provide investors with any additional information that would be material in evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees. 
  The unaudited interim consolidating financial statements for the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the non-guarantors are as follows:

Factors Affecting Business Segment Net Sales 
  The percentage increase (decrease) in Net sales attributable to each of the factors indicated for each of our business segments is as follows: 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Consolidated Results 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net sales   decreased     $90 million  , or   6.4%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower vinyl acetate monomer ("VAM") pricing and volume and lower acetic acid pricing in our Acetyl Intermediates segment; 
                
    lower acetate tow pricing and volume in our Consumer Specialties segment; and 
                
    lower pricing in our Industrial Specialties segment; 
     partially offset by: 
             
    higher volume for polyoxymethylene ("POM") in our Advanced Engineered Materials segment. 
     Operating profit   increased     $60 million  , or   32.3%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower raw material costs across most of our business segments; 
     partially offset by: 
             
    lower Net sales.

As a percentage of Net sales, SG A expenses   decreased   from   6.6%   to   6.1%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to: 
             
    productivity initiatives across most of our business segments. 
     Our effective income tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   5%   compared to   33%   for the same period in   2015  . Our lower effective income tax rate is primarily due to remeasurement of prior year tax positions due to audit closures and technical clarifications in certain jurisdictions of   $52 million  . 
  Our effective income tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts and mix of income and loss in those jurisdictions to which they relate, as well as discrete items and non-deductible expenses that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. 
  See    Note 13 - Income Taxes    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net sales   decreased     $262 million  , or   6.0%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower acetic acid and VAM pricing in our Acetyl Intermediates segment; 
                
    lower pricing in our Industrial Specialties segment; and 
                
    lower acetate tow pricing in our Consumer Specialties segment; 
     partially offset by: 
             
    higher acetate tow volume in our Consumer Specialties segment; and 
                
    higher volume for POM in our Advanced Engineered Materials segment. 
     Operating profit   increased     $145 million  , or   23.0%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower raw material costs across all of our business segments; 
                
    a decrease in SG  and 
                
    an increase in depreciation and amortization expense in our Acetyl Intermediates segment during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of $39 million in accelerated depreciation expense in the prior year related to property, plant and equipment no longer in use at our ethanol technology development unit in Clear Lake, Texas, which did not recur in the current year. See    Note 12 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information; 
     partially offset by: 
             
    lower Net sales. 
     As a percentage of Net sales, SG A expenses   decreased   from   6.8%   to   5.7%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to: 
             
    productivity initiatives across most of our business segments; and 
                
    lower functional spending and incentive compensation costs. 
     Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates   decreased     $24 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $40 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate as a result of lower pricing for methanol and methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("MTBE") and higher raw material costs.

Our effective income tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   15%   compared to   22%   for the same period in   2015  . Our lower effective income tax rate is primarily due to remeasurement of prior year tax positions due to audit closures and technical clarifications in certain jurisdictions of   $52 million  . 
  Assuming no material changes to tax rules and regulations or cash repatriation plans, we expect to realize operational savings in connection with the establishment of our centralized European headquarters, which will directly impact the mix of our earnings and may result in favorable income tax impacts in subsequent years. Our effective tax rate will vary based on the jurisdictions in which income is actually generated and remains subject to potential volatility from changing tax legislation in the US and other tax jurisdictions. We continue to assess our business model and its impact in various jurisdictions. On April 4, 2016, the US Department of the Treasury announced the issuance of proposed regulations regarding corporate tax inversions and related earnings stripping. These proposed regulations, which were to be effective 90 days after finalization, included provisions that may be interpreted to impact other common tax structures including intercompany financing and obligations. Subsequent to the balance sheet date of September 30, 2016, on October 13, 2016, the US Department of Treasury issued the final regulations. We are currently evaluating the tax consequences of the new regulations to our cross-border treasury management practices and intercompany financing structure.

This business segment also produces organic solvents and intermediates for pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical products. The pricing of products within the intermediate chemistry business is influenced by changes in the cost of raw materials, most notably methanol and ethylene.  
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net sales   decreased   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower pricing due to lower global industry utilization and a decline in global feedstock costs, such as methanol, which negatively impacted pricing for most of our products. The impact on acetic acid, VAM and acetate esters represents approximately two-thirds of the pricing decrease; and 
                
    lower volume for VAM, which represents all of the decrease in volume, primarily due to the expiration of a significant VAM contract. 
     Operating profit   increased   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower raw material costs, primarily for methanol; and 
                
    cost savings of $22 million, primarily due to productivity initiatives; 
     largely offset by: 
             
    lower Net sales. 
     Depreciation and amortization expense, which is included within Operating profit (loss), increased during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to the impact from the startup of production at the Fairway Methanol LLC ("Fairway") facility in October 2015. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net sales   decreased   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
  
    51 

Table of Contents  

lower pricing due to lower global industry utilization and a decline in global feedstock costs, such as methanol, ethylene and carbon monoxide, which negatively impacted pricing for most of our products. The impact on acetic acid, VAM and acetate esters represents approximately three-quarters of the pricing decrease. 
     Operating profit   increased   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower energy and raw material costs, primarily for carbon monoxide, methanol and ethylene; and 
                
    cost savings of $26 million, primarily due to productivity initiatives; 
     largely offset by: 
             
    lower Net sales. 
     Depreciation and amortization expense, which is included within Operating profit (loss), decreased during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   as a result of   $39 million   in accelerated depreciation expense in the prior year related to property, plant and equipment no longer in use at our ethanol technology unit in Clear Lake, Texas, which did not recur in the current year, partially offset by the impact from the startup of production at the Fairway facility in October 2015. See    Note 12 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information. 
   
  Other Activities 

Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs, including administrative activities such as finance, information technology and human resource functions, interest income and expense associated with our financing activities and results of our captive insurance companies. Other Activities also includes the interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses components of our net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans, which are not allocated to our business segments. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Operating loss   decreased   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to: 
             
    lower functional spending and incentive compensation costs of $12 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $1.0 billion   available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and   $53 million   available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations. 
  While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the next twelve months. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels. 
  Total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of   $250 million   to   $300 million   in   2016   primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our Advanced Engineered Materials and Acetyl Intermediates segments. 
  On a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, Celanese US, have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese US in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our Series A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock"). 
  Cash Flows 
  Cash and cash equivalents   increased     $285 million   to   $1.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to December 31,   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $561 million   of the   $1.3 billion   of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the US, we will access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs. Currently, there are no planned cash distributions that would result in incremental US taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings. As a result, we have not recorded any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations. 
             
    Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
     Net cash   provided by   operating activities   increased     $214 million   to   $940 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $726 million   for the same period in   2015  . Net cash provided by operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased primarily due to: 
             
    an increase in net earnings; and 
                
    favorable trade working capital of   $64 million   primarily due to a decrease in trade payables. 
                
    Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
     Net cash   used in   investing activities   decreased     $269 million   to   $192 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $461 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to: 
             
    a decrease in capital expenditures of   $263 million   relating to Fairway. 
                
    Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
     Net cash   used in   financing activities   increased     $403 million   from   $64 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $467 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to: 
             
    an increase of $350 million in net short-term borrowings under our previous senior secured revolving credit facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which were repaid in full during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as discussed below; and 
                
    a decrease of   $202 million   in contributions received from Mitsui in exchange for ownership in Fairway;

     Debt and Other Obligations 
  On March 3, 2016, the State of Wisconsin Public Finance Authority completed a $170 million offering of pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, the proceeds of which were loaned to Celanese US and used to repay the pollution control and industrial revenue bonds previously issued for our benefit. 
  On July 8, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amendment of our accounts receivable securitization facility, extending its maturity to July 2019 and decreasing the available amount to   $120 million  . 
  On July 15, 2016, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiaries entered into a new senior credit agreement consisting of a   $500 million   senior unsecured term loan and a   $1.0 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit) each maturing in 2021. The proceeds from the new senior unsecured term loan and   $409 million   of borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were used to repay our Term C-2 and C-3 senior secured credit facilities. 
  On September 26, 2016, Celanese US completed an offering of  750 million in principal amount of the 1.125% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. Net proceeds from the issuance of the 1.125% Notes were used to repay   $411 million   of outstanding borrowings under our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. 
  There have been no material changes to our debt or other obligations described in our   2015   Form 10-K other than those disclosed above and in    Note 8 - Debt    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
  Share Capital 
  There have been no material changes to our share capital described in our   2015   Form 10-K other than those disclosed in    Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Except as otherwise described in this report, there have been no material revisions outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as described in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. 
  We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our   2015   Form 10-K. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates in MD A in our   2015   Form 10-K.

Pension and Other Postretirement Obligations 
  Beginning in 2016, we elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, we estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We have elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost will be completely offset in the annual actuarial (gain) loss reported. We have accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2016. The adoption of the full yield curve approach will reduce 2016 service and interest cost by approximately   $29 million   as compared to the previous method. See    Note 1 - Description of the Company and Basis of Presentation    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.   Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the normal conduct of its business, relating to such matters as product liability, land disputes, contracts, antitrust, intellectual property, workers' compensation, chemical exposure, asbestos exposure, trade compliance, prior acquisitions and divestitures, claims of legacy stockholders, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment. The Company is actively defending those matters where it is named as a defendant. Due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, the Company's litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from legal proceedings. See    Note 10 - Environmental    and    Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for a discussion of material environmental matters and material commitments and contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings. There have been no significant developments in the "Legal Proceedings" described in our   2015   Form 10-K other than those disclosed in    Note 10 - Environmental    and    Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies    in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the Company's Bay City, Texas site received a Proposed Agreed Order from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") alleging violations of the Texas Health   Safety Code and/or Commission Rules as a result of a September 2015 chemical release and proposed an administrative penalty of approximately $125,000. In October 2016, following further review, the TCEQ agreed to reduce the administrative penalty to approximately $25,000. The Bay City, Texas site is included in the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment.

SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED 
  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
  OF 
  CELANESE CORPORATION 
  The undersigned, David N. Weidman, certifies that he is the Chief Executive Officer and President of Celanese Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Delaware, and does hereby further certify as follows: 
  (1)    The name of the Corporation is Celanese Corporation (the "  Corporation  ").  The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of the State of Delaware on November 3, 2004. 
  (2)    The name under which the Corporation was originally incorporated is: Celanese Corporation. 
  (3)    An Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 18, 2005. 
  (4)    This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation amends and restates the Certificate of the Incorporation of the Corporation. 
  (5)    This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "  DGCL  ").  
  (6)    This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will be effective upon its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
  (7)    Pursuant to Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the DGCL, the text of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 
  ARTICLE I 
  SECTION 1.1      Name  .  The name of the Corporation (the "Corporation") is: Celanese Corporation. 
  ARTICLE II 
  SECTION 2.1      Address  .  The registered office in the State of Delaware is the Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801.  The name of its registered agent at such address is the Corporation Trust Company.

ARTICLE III 
  SECTION 3.1      Purpose  .  The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). 
  ARTICLE IV 
  SECTION 4.1      Capitalization  .  (a)    The total number of shares of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 600,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of which 400,000,000 shares shall be designated Series A Common Stock ("Series A Common Stock") and 100,000,000 shares shall be designated Series B Common Stock ("Series B Common Stock" and, with the Series A Common Stock, the "Common Stock"), and (ii) 100,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"). 
  (b)  Upon the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "  Stock Split Effective Time  ") each share of Series B Common Stock outstanding immediately prior thereto ("  Old Series B Common Stock  "), shall automatically, without further action on the part of the Corporation or any holder of such Old Series B Common Stock, be reclassified as and shall become 152.772947 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series B Common Stock, as constituted following the Stock Split Effective Time.  The reclassification of the Old Series B Common Stock into such new number of shares of Series B Common Stock will be deemed to occur at the Stock Split Effective Time, regardless of when any certificates previously representing such shares of Old Series B Common Stock (if such shares are held in certificated form) are physically surrendered to the Corporation in exchange for certificates representing such new number of shares of Series B Common Stock.  After the Stock Split Effective Time, certificates previously representing shares of Old Series B Common Stock (if such shares are held in certificated form) will, until such shares are surrendered to the Corporation in exchange for certificates representing such new number of shares of Series B Common Stock, represent the number of Series B Common Stock into which such shares of Old Series B Common Stock shall have been reclassified pursuant to this Section 4.1(b).  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.1(b) to the contrary, in any case in which the reclassification of shares of Old Series B Common Stock into shares of Series B Common Stock would otherwise result in any holder of Series B Common Stock holding a fractional share, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any such fractional share, pay the holder of Series B Common Stock the fair value of such fraction and such fair value shall be determined by multiplying such fraction of a share by $16. 
  SECTION 4.2      Preferred Stock  .  The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions, to provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, for series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each such series, to fix the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the preferences and relative, participating, conversion, optional or other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series, as are not inconsistent with this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of  

3 

Incorporation or any amendment hereto, and as may be permitted by the DGCL.  The powers, preferences and relative, participating, conversion, optional and other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding.   
  SECTION 4.3      Common Stock  .  
  (a)  General  .  Except as provided in this Section 4.3 or as otherwise required by the DGCL, all shares of Series A Common Stock and the Series B Common Stock shall have the same powers, privileges, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, and shall be identical to each other in all respects. 
  (b)  Dividends  .  (i)  Except for the Mandatory Dividends or as otherwise required by the DGCL, in any circumstance where the Corporation may declare dividends or otherwise make distributions (including, without limitation, any distribution on liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation) on either the Series A Common Stock or Series B Common Stock, the Corporation shall declare the same per share dividends or make the same per share distributions, as the case may be, on the other series of Common Stock;   provided  ,   however  , that if any such dividends or distributions are declared with respect to the Series B Common Stock in the form of additional shares of Series B Common Stock, such dividends or distributions shall be made with respect to the Series A Common Stock in the form of an equivalent number of shares of Series A Common Stock.  Subject to applicable law and rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any class or series of stock having preference over the right to participate with the Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and except as provided in Section 4.3(b)(ii), dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock out of the assets of the Corporation which are by law available therefor at such times and in such amounts as the Board of Directors in its discretion shall determine. 
  (ii)  Series B Common Stock  .  The holders of the Series B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, and the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall declare (subject only to the legal availability of funds for the payment thereof) at any time on or after January 24, 2005, the following mandatory dividends on the Series B Common Stock (collectively, the "  Mandatory Dividends  "), each payable on a pro rata basis with respect to the then-outstanding shares of Series B Common Stock: 
             2) 
    an aggregate cash dividend equal to $15.20 multiplied by the number of shares of Series A Common Stock purchased by the underwriters of the initial public offering of the Series A Common  

4 

Stock contemplated by the prospectus for such offering, dated January 20, 2005, pursuant to the option granted to such underwriters, under the underwriting agreement related to such offering, to purchase up to 7,500,000 shares of Series A Common Stock (the "Over-Allotment Option"); and 
           (B) 
    as soon as possible following the expiration of the Over-Allotment Option (which will occur on February 19, 2005) a stock dividend, paid in shares of Series A Common Stock, of an aggregate number of shares of Series A Common Stock equal to (1) 7,500,000 minus (2) the number of shares of Series A Common Stock actually purchased pursuant to the Over-Allotment Option. 
     For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any holder of Series A Common Stock, in its capacity as such, be entitled to receive any portion of the Mandatory Dividends. 
  (iii)  The Corporation shall take all actions required or permitted under the DGCL to permit the payment of the Mandatory Dividends and shall declare and pay such dividends as provided in this Section 4.3(b)(ii) to the extent there are funds legally available therefor. 
  (c)  Voting Rights  .  Each holder of record of Series A Common Stock and each holder of record of Series B Common Stock shall have one vote for each share of such series of Common Stock that is outstanding in his, her or its name on the books of the Corporation and which is entitled to vote.  The holders of record of Series A Common Stock and holders of record of Series B Common Stock shall vote as a single class on all matters, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  In the election of directors, each stockholder shall be entitled to cast for any one candidate no greater number of votes than the number of shares held by such stockholder; no stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes on behalf of any candidate.  Except as otherwise required by law, holders of record of either series of Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL. 
  (d)  Consent Required for Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws  .  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be required for any amendment, alteration or repeal (including by merger, consolidation or otherwise by operation of law) of any provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation  

5 

that would adversely affect the powers, privileges or rights of the Series B Common Stock or the holders thereof in such capacity (in either case except for changes affecting only those powers, privileges or rights shared by both series of Common Stock and affecting such powers, privileges or rights equally with respect to both series of Common Stock). 
  (e)  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up  .  Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over the right to participate with the Common Stock with respect to the distribution of assets of the Corporation upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by such holders.  Neither the holders of Series A Common Stock nor the holders of Series B Common Stock shall have any preference over the other in connection with such distribution. 
  (f)  Conversion  .  (i)  At any time and from time to time any holder of Series B Common Stock may, at such holder's option, convert all or any portion of such holder's shares of Series B Common Stock into an equal number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series A Common Stock by: (A) if such shares are held in certificated form, delivery and surrender to the Corporation of the certificates representing the shares of Series B Common Stock to be so converted or (B) if such shares are held in book-entry form, delivery of written notice to the Corporation.  Any conversion pursuant to this Section 4.3(f)(i) shall be deemed to have been effected at the time of such surrender or delivery of such written notice, as the case may be.  Upon such surrender or delivery of written notice pursuant to this Section 4.3(f)(i), the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or upon the written order of the record owner of such shares of Series B Common Stock certificates representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series A Common Stock into which the shares of Series B Common Stock represented by such surrendered certificates or covered by such written notice, as the case may be, have been converted in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.3(f)(i).   
  (ii)  Immediately upon the payment in full of the Mandatory Dividends to the holders of Series B Common Stock (the "  Conversion Event  "), without any action on the part of the Corporation or any holder or holders of Series B Common Stock, each share of Series B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the payment of the Mandatory Dividends shall automatically be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Series A Common Stock.  Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event, prompt written notice thereof and of the resulting conversion of the Series B Common Stock shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each person who immediately prior to the Conversion Event was a holder of record of shares of Series B Common Stock, at such person's address as the same appears on the stock register of the Corporation;   provided, however  , that neither a failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall affect the effectiveness of the conversion of any shares of Series B Common Stock.  Each such notice shall include a statement setting forth the place or places where certificates formerly representing shares of Series B Common Stock (if such shares are held in certificated form) are to be surrendered in accordance  

6 

with this paragraph.  Conversion pursuant to this Section 4.3(f)(ii) shall be deemed to have been effected at the time of the Conversion Event.  Immediately upon the occurrence of the Conversion Event, the rights of the holders of shares of Series B Common Stock so converted, as such, shall cease and such holders shall be treated for all purposes as having become the holders of the shares of Series A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion;   provided  ,   however  , that such persons shall be entitled to receive when paid any dividends declared on the Series B Common Stock as of a record date preceding the Conversion Event and unpaid as of the time of the Conversion Event.  With respect to shares of Series B Common Stock held in book-entry form, the Corporation shall, as promptly as practicable after the Conversion Event, deliver or cause to be delivered to or upon the written order of the record owner of such shares of Series B Common Stock certificates representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series A Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Common Stock have been converted in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.3(f)(ii).  With respect to shares of Series B Common Stock held in certificated form, as promptly as practicable upon the delivery to the Corporation of the certificates formerly representing such shares of Series B Common Stock, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or upon the written order of the record owner of such shares of Series B Common Stock certificates representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series A Common Stock into which the shares of Series B Common Stock represented by such surrendered certificates have been converted in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.3(f)(ii).   
  (iii)  The Corporation will pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Series A Common Stock on the conversion of shares of Series B Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.3(f);   provided  ,   however  , that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any registration of transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Series A Common Stock in a name other than that of the record owner of Series B Common Stock converted or to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid. 
  (iv)  As long as any shares of Series B Common Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Series A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of shares of Series B Common Stock, that number of shares of Series A Common Stock necessary to effect the conversion of all of the then outstanding shares of Series B Common Stock.  If at any time, the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines that the number of authorized but unissued shares of Series A Common Stock would be insufficient to effect the conversion of all of the then outstanding shares of Series B Common Stock, the Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Series A Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient to effect such conversion. 

7 

(v)  Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event or a conversion of all or any portion of Series B Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3(f)(i), the Series B Common Stock so converted shall be cancelled and retired and may not be reissued.  Following a Conversion Event or the conversion pursuant to Section 4.3(f)(i) of all outstanding shares of Series B Common Stock and the filing of a certificate of retirement with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 243 of the DGCL, all references in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Common Stock shall be deemed to refer only to the Series A Common Stock. 
  (g)  Preemptive Rights  .  Neither holders of the Series A Common Stock nor holders of Series B Common Stock shall have preemptive rights. 
  (h)  Restrictions on Issuance  .  Shares of Series B Common Stock may not be issued by the Corporation to any Person other than Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 1, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 2, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 3 and BA Capital Investors Sidecar Fund, L.P., or their respective Affiliates, except with the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series B Common Stock. 
  (i)  Adjustments  .  In the event that the Corporation shall at any time when any shares of Series B Common Stock are outstanding effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Series A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series A Common Stock, then in each case the Corporation shall, at the same time, effect an equivalent subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Series B Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series B Common Stock.  In the event that the Corporation shall at any time when any shares of Series A Common Stock are outstanding effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Series B Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series B Common Stock, then in each case the Corporation shall, at the same time, effect an equivalent subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Series A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Series A Common Stock. 
  ARTICLE V 
  SECTION 5.1      By-laws  .  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the DGCL and subject to Section 4.3(d), the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, amend, alter and repeal the By-laws of the Corporation without the assent or vote of the stockholders, in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% in voting power of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend or repeal Sections 2.02, 2.03, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04 or 3.05, or the proviso to Section 9.01, of the By-laws or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith. 

8 

ARTICLE VI 
  SECTION 6.1      Books and Records  .  The books and records of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any mandatory requirement of law) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or by the By-laws of the Corporation. 
  ARTICLE VII 
  SECTION 7.1      Board of Directors:  Composition  .  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than seven directors or more than fifteen directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors.  The directors shall be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III.  Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  Class I directors shall be originally elected for a term expiring at the 2005 annual meeting of stockholders, Class II directors shall be originally elected for a term expiring at the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, and Class III directors shall be originally elected for a term expiring at the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders.  At each annual meeting of stockholders, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders.  If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director.  A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires and until his successor shall be elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.  Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the By-laws of the Corporation shall so provide. 
  SECTION 7.2      Board of Directors:  Vacancies  .  Any newly created directorship on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except, for so long as Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 1, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 2, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 3 and their respective affiliates (collectively, "Blackstone") are the beneficial owners, in the aggregate, of at least 25% in voting power of all shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, then only the stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors shall be entitled to fill such newly created directorship or vacancy.  Except for the filling of directorships by stockholders as provided in the preceding sentence (which shall require only a plurality of the votes cast in respect of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors), if any applicable provision of the DGCL expressly  

9 

confers power on stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors voting as a single class.  Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. 
  SECTION 7.3      Board of Directors:  Removal of Directors  .  Any or all of the directors (other than the directors elected by the holders of any class or classes of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, voting separately as a class or classes, as the case may be) may be removed at any time either with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting as a single class;   provided  ,   however  , if at any time Blackstone no longer is the beneficial owner, in the aggregate, of at least 50.1% in voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, then any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% in voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting as a single class.  For purposes of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the "beneficial owner" of shares shall be determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
  SECTION 7.4      Voting Rights of Preferred Stock  .  (a)  Notwithstanding Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article VII unless expressly provided by such terms. 
  (b)  Notwithstanding Section 7.1, during any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have the right to elect additional directors, then upon commencement of the right to elect such directors and for the duration of the period during which such right continues:  (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors provided for in the terms of such Preferred Stock, and (ii) each such additional director shall serve until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such director's right to hold such office terminates pursuant to such terms, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his or her earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal.  Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such Preferred Stock, the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such Preferred Stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the  

10 

death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced accordingly. 
  ARTICLE VIII 
  SECTION 8.1      Meetings of Stockholders  . 
  (a)  Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an office or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded;   provided  ,   however   if at any time Blackstone no longer is the beneficial owner, in the aggregate, of at least 50.1% in voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, then any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may no longer be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. 
  (b)  Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors which has been duly designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and authority, as provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors or in the By-laws of the Corporation, include the power to call such meetings, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.

  SECTION 9.1      Limitation of Liability  .  To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for any liability imposed by law (as in effect from time to time) (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for any act or omission not in good faith or which involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.   
  SECTION 9.2      Indemnification of Directors, Officers, Employees or Agents  .  The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify its directors where such director is made party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal or administrative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director of the  

11 

Corporation.  The Corporation may accord to any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation the right to, or regulate the manner of providing to any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. 
  SECTION 9.3      Adjustments; Amendments  .  If the DGCL is amended after the date of the filing of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors or permitting indemnification to a fuller extent, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited, and indemnification shall be extended, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended from time to time.  No repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article IX by the stockholders shall adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing by virtue of this Article IX at the time of such repeal or modification. 
  ARTICLE X 
  SECTION 10.1      Amendment  .  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% in voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Article V, Article VII, Article VIII or Article X or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith. 
  ARTICLE XI 
  SECTION 11.1      Severability  .  If any provision or provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 
  ARTICLE XII 
  SECTION 12.1      Competition and Corporate Opportunities. 
  (a)  In recognition and anticipation that (i) certain directors, principals, officers, employees and/or other representatives of Blackstone Crystal Holdings Capital Partners (Cayman) IV Ltd., Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 1, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 2, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) Ltd. 3 and BA Capital Investors Sidecar Fund, L.P.

  FIRST  : That at a meeting of the Board of Directors (the "  Board  ") of Celanese Corporation (the "  Corporation  " resolutions were duly adopted setting forth a proposed amendment of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "  Certificate  "), declaring said amendment to be advisable and directing that the proposed amendment be considered at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation to be held on April 21, 2016. The resolution setting forth the proposed amendment is as follows:  
  RESOLVED  , that the Certificate be amended by changing the Section thereof numbered "Section 7.1." so that, as amended, said Section shall be and read as follows:  
  SECTION 7.1. Board of Directors: Composition.   The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than seven directors or more than fifteen directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors.
