1. Organization and basis of presentation   

Organization    

MGT Capital Investments, Inc.
( MGT,   the Company,   we,   us ) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in
2000. The Company was originally incorporated in Utah in 1977. MGT is comprised of the parent company, wholly owned subsidiaries
MGT Cybersecurity, Inc. ( MGT Cybersecurity ), Medicsight, Inc. ( Medicsight ), MGT Sports, Inc. ( MGT
Sports ), MGT Studios, Inc. ( MGT Studios ), and majority owned subsidiary MGT Gaming, Inc. ( MGT
Gaming ). MGT Studios also owns a controlling minority interest in the subsidiary M2P Americas, Inc. Our corporate office
is located in Durham, North Carolina    .      

Cybersecurity

MGT
and its subsidiaries are in the process of acquiring a diverse portfolio of cyber security technologies. With cyber security industry
pioneer, John McAfee, as the Executive Chairman , the Company is positioned to address various
cyber threats through advanced protection technologies for mobile and personal tech devices, including tablets and smart phones.
The Company is currently in the process of acquiring D Vasive, a provider of leading edge anti spy software, and Demonsaw,
a provider of a secure and anonymous file sharing software platform.   

On
May 9, 2016 we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, MGT Cybersecurity     ,
Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  D Vasive APA ) to acquire certain assets related to the
D Vasive business (as defined below). D Vasive, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, is in the business of developing and
marketing of certain privacy and anti spy applications (the  D Vasive Business ). Pursuant to the terms
of the D Vasive APA, the Company has agreed to purchase assets ( D Vasive Assets ) integral to the D Vasive
Business, including but not limited to applications for use on mobile devices, intellectual property, customer lists, databases,
sales pipelines, proposals and project files, licenses and permits. Among the Purchased Assets is the D Vasive application
which is designed for protection from invasive applications that seek access to personal contacts, cameras and other information
on smart phones, tablets and other mobile devices. The Company intends to change its corporate name to  John McAfee Global
Technologies, Inc.  upon closing of the D Vasive transaction.   

On September 19, 2016,
the New York Stock Exchange (the  Exchange ) informed the Company that it will not approve the listing on the
Exchange of the 43.8 million shares that the Company is required to issue in order to complete the closing of the merger with
D-Vasive, Inc., a Wyoming corporation. The parties to the transaction remain committed to closing the transaction and are exploring
alternatives. The terms under which the acquisition would be consummated, including a cash investment in the Company that might
be made in connection with the acquisition, remain under discussion. However, we cannot assure you at this time whether or when
the D-Vasive acquisition would be consummated. 

On
May 26, 2016, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the  Demonsaw APA ) with Demonsaw LLC, a Delaware
company ( Demonsaw ) and the shareholders of Demonsaw, for the purchase of certain technology and assets of Demonsaw.
Demonsaw is in the business of developing and marketing certain secure and anonymous information sharing applications (the  Demonsaw
Business ). Pursuant to the terms of the Demonsaw APA, the Company has agreed to purchase assets ( Demonsaw Assets )
integral to the Demonsaw Business, including but not limited to the source code for the Demonsaw solution, intellectual property,
customer lists, databases, sales pipelines, proposals and project files, licenses and permits. Among the Demonsaw Assets is the
Demonsaw application which is designed for use in Windows and Apple operating systems. However, prior to the closing of this transaction,
the Company and Demonsaw executed an agreement to terminate the Demonsaw APA, pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Demonsaw APA. Subsequently,
D Vasive entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the  LLC Purchase Agreement ) with the holders
of all of Demonsaw s outstanding membership interest, whereby D Vasive purchased all such membership interest from
the Demonsaw members. The closing of the transaction contemplated under the LLC Purchase Agreement is contingent on, among other
things, the closing of the transaction contemplated under the D-Vasive APA.  

Gaming    

Prior
to second quarter ending June 30, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries were principally engaged in the business of acquiring,
developing and monetizing assets in the online and mobile gaming space as well as the social casino industry. MGT s portfolio
includes a social casino platform Slot Champ and minority stakes in the skill based gaming platform MGT Play and fantasy
sports operator DraftDay Gaming Group, Inc. ( DDGG ) (see September 8, 2015 development below).  

In
addition, MGT Gaming owns three patents covering certain features of casino slot machines. Two of the patents were asserted against
alleged infringers in various actions in federal court in Mississippi. In July 2014, MGT Gaming dismissed its lawsuits against
WMS Gaming Inc., and in August 2015, the Company and defendants Aruze America and Penn National Gaming agreed to settle all pending
litigation and all proceedings at the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Company received a payment of $90, which was recorded
as licensing revenue. In an effort to monetize its gaming patent portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company engaged Munich Innovations GmbH, the patent monetization firm that sold MGT s medical patent portfolio to Samsung
in 2013 for $1.5 million. As of June 30, 2016, an impairment charge for the full value of the patent was recorded, as the Company
is in no longer engaged in this business.  

On
September 8, 2015, the Company and MGT Sports entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Viggle, Inc. ( Viggle )
and Viggle s subsidiary DDGG, pursuant to which Viggle acquired all of the assets of the DraftDay.com business ( DraftDay.com )
from the Company and MGT Sports. In exchange for the acquisition of DraftDay.com, Viggle paid MGT Sports the following: (a) 63,467
shares of Viggle s common stock, since renamed Function(x) Inc. (NASDAQ: FNCX) ( FNCX ), (b) a promissory
note in the amount of $234 paid on September 29, 2015, (c) a promissory note in the amount of $1,875 due March 8, 2016 ( FNCX
Note ,  the Note ), and (d) 2,550,000 shares of Common stock of DDGG (private entity). In addition, in exchange
for providing certain transitional services, DDGG issued to MGT Sports a warrant to purchase 1,500,000 shares of DDGG common stock.
Following consummation of the transaction, MGT Sports owns an 11% equity interest in DDGG, FNCX owns 49%, and Sportech, Inc. owns
39%. As a result of the transaction, the Company has presented DraftDay.com as a discontinued operation.  

On
March 24, 2016, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the  FNCX March 24 th  Agreement ) with FNCX.
The purpose of the FNCX March 24 th  Agreement was to exchange the FNCX Note for other equity and debt securities of
FNCX, after the Note went into default on March 8, 2016. On the effective date of the FNCX March 24 th  Agreement, the
Note had an outstanding principal balance of $1,875 and accrued interest in the amount of $51 (the  March 24 th 
Interest ). Pursuant to the FNCX March 24 th  Agreement, a portion consisting of $825 of the outstanding principal
of the FNCX Note was exchanged for 137,418 shares of FNCX s Common stock, and an additional portion of $110 of the
outstanding principal was exchanged for 110 shares (the  FNCX Preferred shares ) of a newly created class of Preferred
stock, the Series D Convertible Preferred stock. The FNCX Preferred shares were subsequently converted into 18,332 shares
of FNCX s Common stock. Finally, FNCX agreed to make a cash payment to MGT Sports for the total amount of March 24 th
 Interest. In exchange for the forgoing, MGT Sports and the Company agreed to waive all Events of Default under the FNCX
Note prior to the       effective
date of the FNCX March 24 th  Agreement and to release FNCX from any rights, remedies and claims related thereto. After
giving effect to the forgoing, the remaining outstanding principal balance of the FNCX Note was $940 which continued to accrue
interest a rate of 5% per annum, and all terms of the Note remained unchanged except that the maturity date was changed to July
31, 2016.  

On
June 14, 2016, the       Company
and MGT Sports entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the  FNCX June 14 th  Agreement ) with FNCX
to exchange $940 remaining outstanding principal of the FNCX Note for 132,092 shares of FNCX s Common stock and FNCX
shall make a cash payment to MGT Sports for the total amount of interest accrued until consummation of the transaction contemplated
in the FNCX June 14 th  Agreement. The closing of the FNCX June 14 th  Agreement is conditioned on FNCX s
shareholders  approval of the issuance of the FNCX Common shares and satisfaction of other closing conditions set forth
in the FNCX June 14 th  Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the Note was recorded on the balance sheet at $640, net
of an impairment charge of $300.      

On
September 16, 2016,FNCX amended its Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding
shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 20 (the  Reverse Stock Split ). The effective date of the Reverse Stock Split
is September 16, 2016. The above common stock share amounts received from FNCX have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock
Split.  

On
August 16, 2016, MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into an LLC Membership Interest Purchase Agreement
(the  Purchase Agreement ) with Jonathan Licata ( Licata ), pursuant to which the Company acquired a 25% interest
in Licata s 70% membership interest (a 17.5% membership interest) in 2MQ LLC ( 2MQ ). In exchange for the acquisition
of the membership interest, the Company paid Licata $115.      

Two
minute Quests (2MQ) LLC is introducing a game for the iwatch and iphone.  

ASC
325-20 provides guidance on investments using the cost method. ASC 325-20 notes that  the cost method is generally followed
for most investments in non-controlled corporations, in some corporate joint ventures, and to a lesser extent in unconsolidated
subsidiaries, particularly foreign.  

The
Company concluded and is accounting for the 17.5% membership interest purchase using the cost basis since the interest has a non-readily
determinable fair value and because the Company carries approximately 17.5% of the equity in the venture. The purchase of the
minority membership interest was valued based on the cash paid for such investment. The Company purchased the membership interest
at a price of $115.  

In
accordance with ASC 325-20, the membership interest in a private, non-controlled entity, should be carried under the cost method.
At each balance sheet date, management determines if any triggering event has occurred, causing the asset to potentially be impaired.  

Management
concluded that as of September 30, 2016, the membership interest was not impaired.      

On
October 19, 2016, the Company received a letter from the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE  or the  Exchange )
stating that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company s common stock (the
 Action ). NYSE Regulation cited Section 1002(c) of the NYSE MKT LLC Company Guide as the reason for the Action. The
cited section is intended to apply when a company has sold or otherwise disposed of its principal operating assets or has ceased
to be an operating company.  

The Company knows of no
facts or circumstances that would lead NYSE to take the Action. The Company has not sold or disposed of its principal operating
assets and believes that it qualifies as an operating company but the Company has decided not to pursue any appeal of the de-listing.
The Company is currently listed on the OTC Pink. 

Basis
of presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Rule 8 03 of Regulation S X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. However, in the opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
of the financial position and operating results have been included in these statements. These Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. Operating
results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for any subsequent quarters or for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

Note
2. Going concern and management plans   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred
significant operating losses since inception and continues to generate losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of
$322,204. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts
or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Commercial
results have been limited and the Company has not generated significant revenues. The Company s primary source of operating
funds since inception has been debt and equity financings. On October 19, 2016, the Company received a letter from the New
York Stock Exchange ( NYSE  or the  Exchange ) stating that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined
to commence proceedings to delist the Company s common stock (the  Action ). The delisting could have an adverse
effect on the Company s ability to secure operating funds from debt and equity financings. The Company cannot assure
its stockholders that the Company s revenues will be sufficient to fund its operations. If adequate funds are not available,
the Company may be required to curtail its operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into arrangements with
collaborative partners or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products
that the Company would not otherwise relinquish     .     

At
September 30, 2016, MGT s cash and cash equivalents were $2,113. The Company intends to raise additional capital,
either through debt or equity financings or through the continued sale of the Company s assets or equity securities
in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital;
however, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds raised will
be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company
is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail or cease its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead
until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be
successful.  

Note
3. Summary of significant accounting policies   

Use
of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions     

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).  

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact
of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company s critical accounting estimates
and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:  

(1)  Fair
value of long lived assets:  Fair value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash
flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined
remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long lived assets are
depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company considers the following to be some examples
of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant under performance or losses of assets relative
to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the
Company s overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired assets or changes in the Company s overall
business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; (v) a significant
decline in the Company s stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates
acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.  

(2)  Valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets:  Management assumes that the realization of the Company s net deferred tax assets
resulting from its net operating loss ( NOL ) carry forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset
against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss
carry forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred
recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations
by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.  

(3)  Estimates
and assumptions used in valuation of equity instruments:  Management estimates expected term of share options and similar instruments,
expected volatility of the Company s Common shares and the method used to estimate it, expected annual rate of quarterly
dividends, and risk free rate(s) to value share options and similar instruments.  

These
significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached
to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.  

Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  

Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes
in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those
estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Principles
of consolidation    

All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Non controlling interest represents the minority equity investment
in MGT subsidiaries, plus the minority investors  share of the net operating results and other components of equity relating
to the non controlling interest.  

Reclassification
of discontinued operations    

In
accordance with  ASC 205 20  regarding the presentation of discontinued operations the assets, liabilities and activity
of the DraftDay.com business have been reclassified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.  

DraftDay.com s
losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are included in  Loss from discontinued operations 
in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  

Summarized
financial information for DraftDay.com s operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are
presented below:  

Revenue
recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned
when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement and that the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to
the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. Our material revenue streams are related
to the delivery of intellectual property license fees and gaming fees:  

Digital
    currencies operating revenues:   The Company will derive its revenue by providing transaction verification services
    within the digital currency network of Bitcoin, commonly termed  Bitcoin mining.  In consideration for these services
    the Company will receive digital currency, Bitcoins ( BTC,   coins ). The coins are recorded as revenue,
    using the average spot price of Bitcoin on the date of receipt. The coins are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair
    value and re-measured at each reporting date. Revaluation gains or losses, as well gains or losses on sale of BTC are recorded
    in the statement of operations     .      Expenses
    associated with running the Bitcoin mining business, such as equipment deprecation, rent and electricity cost are recorded
    as cost of revenues.    

Licensing   
    License fee revenue is derived from the licensing of intellectual property. Revenue from license fees is recognized when notification
    of shipment to the end user has occurred, there are no significant Company obligations with regard to implementation and the
    Company s services are not considered essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement.    

Gaming   
    Gaming revenue is derived from entry fees charged in contests minus prizes paid out in contests.    

Loss
per share    

Basic
loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss applicable to Common shareholders by the weighted average number of Common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to Common shareholders
by the sum of the weighted average number of Common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive Common shares outstanding during
the period. Potential dilutive securities, comprised of the convertible Preferred Stock, unvested restricted shares and stock
options, are not reflected in diluted net loss per share because such shares are anti dilutive.  

The computation of diluted
loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, excludes 1,000,000 unvested restricted shares and 560,000
shares issuable under warrants, as they are anti dilutive due to the Company s net loss. The computation of diluted
loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluded 10,451 shares in connection to the Convertible
Preferred stock, 9,000  unvested restricted shares and
1,020,825 shares issuable under warrants, as they were anti dilutive due to the Company s net loss.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements    

In
April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued  Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016 09 ,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  (topic 718) . The FASB issued this update to
improve the accounting for employee share based payments and affect all organizations that issue share based payment
awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share based payment award transactions are simplified,
including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the new standard.  

In
February 2016, FASB issued  ASU No. 2016 02  Leases  (topic 842) , which creates new accounting and reporting
guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified
as finance or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and
cash flows arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also
requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within that reporting period, with early application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective
approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.  

Note
4.  Investments     

Equity
security investments available for sale, at market value, reflect unrealized appreciation and depreciation, as a result of temporary
changes in market value during the period, in shareholders  equity, net of income taxes in  accumulated other comprehensive
loss  in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For non publicly traded securities, market prices are determined
through the use of pricing models that evaluate securities. For publicly traded securities, market value is based on quoted market
prices or valuation models that use observable market inputs.   

Investments
available for sale   

For
non public, non controlled investments in equity securities, the Company uses the cost method of accounting.  

Investments
at cost   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $276 related to its investment in DDGG.    

Note
5. Goodwill and intangible assets    

Goodwill
represents the difference between purchase cost and the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. Indefinite
lived intangible assets, representing trademarks and trade names, are not amortized unless their useful life is determined to
be finite. Long lived intangible assets are subject to amortization using the straight line method. Goodwill and indefinite
lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of December 31, and more often if a triggering event occurs, by
comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred
based on the overall deterioration of the market capitalization of the Company and evaluated the goodwill for possible impairment.
After the evaluation as of September 30, 2016, management concluded that a full impairment existed based on the Company s
current efforts to capitalize and execute its business plan relating to the asset.  

The
Company s intangible assets for continuing operations consisted of the following:  

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded amortization expense of $0 and $55, respectively. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded amortization expense of $57 and $ 227  ,
respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1,496 related to the
goodwill and $673 related to the intangible assets.

On
September 16, 2016, FNCX amended its Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding
shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 20 (the  Reverse Stock Split ). The effective date of the Reverse Stock Split

Note
12. Segment reporting   

Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company s chief operating decision making group is composed of the Chief Executive Officer. The Company
operates in two segments, Gaming and Intellectual Property. Certain corporate expenses are not allocated to segments.  

The
Company evaluates performance of its operating segments based on revenue and operating loss. The following table summarizes our
segment information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Note
13. Investment and fair value   

The
authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the
principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact. The guidance
describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last
unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:  

Level
    1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   

Level
    2    Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar
    assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by
    observable market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   

Level
    3    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value
    of the assets or liabilities   

The
following tables provides the investments carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016:  

The
Company uses Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of digital currencies and revalues its digital currencies
at every reporting period and recognizes gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations that are attributable to
the change in the fair value of the digital currency.  

The
following table provides the investments carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015:  

Note 14. Subsequent events

cited section is intended to apply when a company has sold or otherwise disposed of its principal operating assets or has ceased

Bitcoin
mining    

Effective
July 25, 2016, the Company engaged in the business of providing transaction verification services within the digital currency
network of Bitcoin, commonly termed  Bitcoin mining.  In consideration for these services the Company receives digital
currency, Bitcoins ( BTC,   coins );  

The
    coins are recorded as revenue, using the average spot price of Bitcoin on the date of receipt;     

The
    coins are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and remeasured at each reporting date. Revaluation gains or losses,
    as well gains or losses on sale of BTC are recorded in the statement of operations; and    

Expenses
    associated with running the Bitcoin mining business, such as equipment deprecation, rent and electricity cost are recorded
    as cost of revenues.     

Bitcoin
mining is the process of adding transaction records to the Bitcoin s public ledger of past transactions. Miners are awarded
Bitcoins for each block of confirmed transactions as well as a fee for each added transaction, also paid in BTC. Payments are
made directly to the Company s Bitcoin wallet at Coinbase.  

Processing
these transactions requires massive computing power and can only be carried out using expensive, specialized hardware ( Bitcoin
machines,  the  machines ). The machines have very high electricity consumption and require constant monitoring,
power and cooling management.  

The
reason for the term  Bitcoin mining  is because it resembles the mining of physical commodities such as gold, for
it requires exertion and slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like precious
metals are mined from the ground.  

MGT s mining
operations  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016    , the
Company purchased 200 bitcoin mining machines from Bitmain Technologies Limited for $311 and power supplies from Hash The Planet
( HTP ) for $27. The       Company

and movement in working capital.

Exchange Agreement (the  Warrant Exchange Agreement ) with the holders ( Holders ) of certain 12% unsecured
promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,750 (the  Notes ) previously issued by the Company pursuant

Risks
and uncertainties related to our future capital requirements    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred
significant operating losses since inception and continues to generate losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of
$322,204. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts
or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Commercial
results have been limited and the Company has not generated significant revenues. The Company s primary source of operating
funds since inception has been debt and equity financings. The Company cannot assure its stockholders that the Company s
revenues will be sufficient to fund its operations. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to curtail
its operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that
may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products that the Company would not otherwise relinquish.  

At
September 30, 2016, MGT s cash and cash equivalents were $2,113. The Company intends to raise additional capital, either
through debt or equity financings or through the continued sale of the Company s assets in order to achieve its business
plan objectives. Management believes that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, no assurance can be provided
that the Company will be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to
attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need
to curtail or cease its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital
is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.  

Off balance
sheet arrangements    

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate
in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements.  

Item
3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.  

Item
4. Controls and procedures   

(a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who
is also our Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) or 15d 15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 (the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q), have not been designed and are not functioning effectively to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred  during  the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1. Legal proceedings   

On
September 1, 2016, MGT Capital Investments, Inc. and John McAfee filed an action in the U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York, seeking a declaration that the use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in its business,
and specifically in the context of renaming MGT Capital Investments, Inc., of which McAfee is the Executive Chairman, to  John
McAfee Global Technologies, Inc.,  does not infringe upon Intel s trademark rights or breach any agreement between
the parties.  Intel has submitted an Amended Answer and Counterclaims alleging Lanham Act and federal/state trademark violations
and common law unfair competition relating to the same factual circumstances.  MGT filed a Reply to Counterclaims on November
3, 2016, and a case management plan and scheduling order was filed on October 28, 2016.   

A number of law firms
have issued press releases announcing that they are investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of the Company regarding potential

have been filed by against the Company alleging violations of the Exchange Act.
