STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial
statements. 

Note 1   Nature of Business and Basis
of Presentation  

The consolidated interim financial statements
included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, have been prepared by the
Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate
to make the information presented not misleading. 

These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting
of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained
therein. It is suggested that these consolidated interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K annual report. The Company
follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports. 

Results of operations for the interim period
are not indicative of annual results. 

Through the Company s subsidiary, Wireless
Wisconsin, LLC, the Company provides high speed wireless Internet connections to residents in rural communities, as well as some
dial-up internet services to businesses and residents within various markets throughout rural Wisconsin. The Company operates in
both a regulated and non-regulated environment. 

Through the Company s subsidiary, Capaciti
Networks, Inc., the Company generates sales of both wired and wireless services, including products, wireless data cards, back
office platform and rate plans to their commercial and enterprise clients. 

As further discussed
in Note 8, the Company entered into an agreement with Wytec International, Inc. ( Wytec ) and its subsidiary Wylink,
Inc. ( Wylink ) pursuant to which the Company agreed to cancel shares of Wytec common stock owned by the Company in
consideration for the cancellation of intercompany debts.  After consummation of the transaction, the Company s percentage
ownership of Wytec decreased to a level such that both Wytec and Wylink are now consolidated as variable interest entities. 
The Company is the primary beneficiary of Wytec and controls it though its governing board and continuity of management . 

The consolidated financial statements are
prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which
contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
incurred continuous losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit of $19,250,532 and a working capital deficit of
$144,035 at September 30, 2016, and has reported negative cash flows from operations in most periods over the last seven
years. In addition, the Company does not currently have the cash resources to meet its operating commitments for the next
twelve months. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems,
expenses, and complications frequently encountered by entrance into established markets and the competitive nature of the
industry in which the Company operates. 

The Company s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet its cash needs
and/or to raise funds to finance ongoing operations and repay debt. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful
in its efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital and/or that cash generated by operations will be adequate to meet the
Company s needs. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern for
a reasonable period of time. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Note 2   Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment consist of the following: 

Depreciation expense totaled $159,765 and $159,140
for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 3   Construction in Process  

Construction in process consists of equipment
and materials that will be used to construct network, plant property and equipment. Equipment and materials related to links that
have not gone live is a small portion of the value of this account and when installed for that purpose will be treated as cost
of goods sold. Largely the value of the equipment and materials will be capitalized when each construction project is completed.
This account will also hold certain direct and indirect non-equipment costs until construction of a market has been completed and
capitalized. 

Note 4   Convertible Debentures   

The Company has issued unsecured convertible
promissory notes at various times from 2008 through 2015. The notes bear interest at rates of 8.0% to 12.5% per annum. The notes
mature at various times through June 2017. At September 30, 2016, convertible debentures totaling $5,000 were outstanding. 

 The principal balance of each note is convertible
into shares of the Company s common stock. The conversion terms of each note varies, but in general, the notes are convertible
at a rate equal to a specified percentage (most range from 80% to 90%) of the Company s average common stock closing price
for a short period of time prior to conversion. 

Note 5   Warrants  

The Company currently has a total of 83,380,952
common stock purchase warrants outstanding to purchase a total of 83,380,952 shares of its common stock exercisable through various
dates ranging to April 17, 2024, all of which are exercisable at $0.025 per share and only if the Company achieves certain milestones.
These warrants are held by the Company s chief executive officer, and as of September 30, 2016 these milestones have not
been met. 

During the period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company paid $88,000 to repurchase 4,190,477 of the unvested CCI common stock purchase warrants held by the Company s
chief executive officer. This is recorded as general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 

Wytec currently has a total of 5,235,342 common
stock purchase warrants outstanding to purchase a total of 5,235,342 shares of Wytec common stock exercisable until various dates
through December 31, 2017, 750,000 of which are exercisable at an exercise price of $1.00, 461,000 of which are exercisable at
an exercise price of $1.25 per share, 75,000 of which are exercisable at an exercise price of $1.45, 3,949,342 of which are exercisable

Note 8   Intercompany Transaction
with Wytec International, Inc. and Subsidiaries  

On July 26, 2016, a Certificate of Designation
for the Company s Series C Preferred Stock was recorded with the Secretary of State of Nevada designating 1,000 shares of
its authorized preferred stock as Series C Preferred Stock.  The Series C Preferred Stock does not have a dividend rate or
liquidation preference and is not convertible into shares of common stock.  For so long as any shares of the Series C Preferred
Stock remain issued and outstanding, the holders thereof, voting separately as a class, shall have the right to vote in an amount
equal to 51% of the total vote (representing a super majority voting power) with respect to all matters submitted to a vote of
the shareholders of the Company.   On July 20, 2016, the Board of Directors of Wytec International, Inc. (the  Company ),
a subsidiary of Competitive Companies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, authorized the issuance of 1,000 shares of Series C Preferred
Stock to the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, William H. Gray, upon the recording of the Certificate of Designation
with the Secretary of State of Nevada. 

An audit of Wytec International, Inc. ( Wytec )
financial statements, as a stand-alone entity, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2104 and 2015 was completed on July 28,
2016 (the  Audit ). Prior to the completion of the audit, the Company owed an intercompany debt to Wytec for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2104 and 2015 ( Intercompany Debt ). As of June 30, 2016, the Company owned 25,000,000 shares
of Wytec s common stock (the  Wytec Stock ). Prior to the completion of the Audit, management of Wytec and the
Company agreed to settle the Intercompany Debt by exchanging 24,529,389 shares of Wytec Stock owned by the Company for settlement
of its intercompany debt. The settlement of the Intercompany Debt and the exchange of 24,529,389 shares of Wytec Stock are reflected
in the Audit and are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements for the period ending September 30, 2016.
The value of the Wytec Stock was calculated based on the relative fair value of the two companies, Wytec as a separate entity and
the Company on a consolidated basis without Wytec, and then determining the relative percentage of the Company s total market
capitalization attributable to Wytec. Based on these and other considerations including relative contributed capital, management
of Wytec and the Company determined that Wytec s value represented 62% and 82% of the Company s market capitalization
as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, respectively. This value was then divided by the number of outstanding shares of
Wytec s common and preferred stock as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, respectively. When computing the number
of outstanding shares of Wytec s common and preferred stock as of December 31, 2015, the shares of Wytec Stock received by
Wytec from the Company to settle the Intercompany Debt were treated as treasury stock. During the period ended September 30, 2016,
Wytec and the Company agreed to settle additional Intercompany Debt by exchanging an additional 214,662 shares of Wytec Stock owned
by the Company for settlement its additional intercompany debt and these shares were treated as treasury stock.

Business  

Competitive Companies, Inc.  (the  Company )
was originally incorporated in the state of Nevada in October 2001 and acts as a holding company for its operating subsidiaries,
Wytec International, Inc. ( Wytec ), Wylink, Inc., Wireless Wisconsin LLC, Capaciti Networks, Inc., Innovation Capital
Management, Inc., and Innovation Capital Management LLC (collectively, the  Subsidiaries ). The Company and its Subsidiaries
(also collectively referred to as  CCI ) are involved in providing next generation fixed and mobile wireless broadband
Internet services nationally and internationally to wholesale, retail and enterprise customers. 

Due to developments in our intellectual property
and the continued development of our municipal and governmental relationships along with the addition of key personnel and consultants,
management intended to enter into 30 markets by year-end 2015. This strategy was redesigned to reduce market entry costs and enhance
marketing capabilities along with the development of a commissioned based agent sales channel and telemarketing. Included in our
market entry schedule are new products and services for small and medium businesses and our continued optimization strategies for
assisting municipalities in leveraging current assets such as utility poles for maximum utilization related to the provisioning
of telecommunications and machine to machine ( M2M ) services. 

Our current business strategy incorporates
the use of millimeter wave technology utilizing wireless frequencies from 5GHz to 80GHz spectrum. Wytec, CCI s subsidiary,
has constructed the use of these spectrums in three (3) markets including San Antonio, Texas., Columbus, Ohio and Denver, Colorado
and has commercialized a broadband Internet service directed to the small medium business (known as  SMB ) in two of
three markets. The initial focus of service is directed to highly concentrated areas such as the Central Business District (CBD)
of each market and to expand the service to high density business zones outside of the CBD. The Company plans to utilize its patent
pending LPN-16 Micro Cell technology to provide coverage to these zones. 

We believe the use of millimeter wave spectrum
is a key component to the development of a 5G network and further support to what has now become popularized as the  Smart
City . Smart Cities are designed to advance multiple mobile communications services, including but not limited to, public
safety, first responder, machine to machine, and carrier offload services. 

Currently our network design is capable of
delivering bandwidth services of up to 1.5 gigabits per second to a wide range of customers including small, midsize and large
corporate operations located in Tier One, Tier Two, and Tier Three (the term  Tier  defines the population size of
the link location) cities throughout the United States. Our millimeter wave technology serves as the backbone for our platform
networks capable of supporting a host of high capacity data throughput objectives. 

On December 18, 2015, Wytec performed an outside
speed test on the first LPN-16 working prototype and produced record performance speeds in excess of 500 Mbps to a smart phone
and 600 Mbps to a laptop computer. Earlier speed tests and network demonstrations enabled us, through Wytec, to consummate our
first services agreement with the City of Columbus on July 7, 2014, Wytec has now substantially completed its footprint coverage
of the Central Business District ( CBD ) of Columbus, Ohio and San Antonio, Texas in preparation for the Company s
new marketing and sales strategy. 

Overview of Current Operations  

We continue to shift our focus away from our
past revenue sources, such as, web hosting, dial-up, wireless, DSL, and wired internet services, and move toward the design, development,
and implementation of 4G/5G networks with an accelerated concentration towards the development and support of our  Smart
City  concept. We believe recent national and international relationships have enhanced the progression of our  Smart
City  development in conjunction with the growing relationships with city and state governments. 

On November 8, 2011, we acquired Wytec, a non-operational
company that owns five U.S. patents related to LMDS. LMDS deals primarily in the transmission of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint
data distribution utilizing millimeter wave spectrum. Though the patents are currently unusable in our current 4G/5G backhaul configuration,
we intend to advance a derivative of the technology for usage in future 5G millimeter backhaul deployments. Millimeter wave technology
continues to grow as the predominate choice in gigabyte data transmission for the future 5G network. 

On September 7, 2012, Wytec entered into a
definitive agreement with General Patent Corporation ( GPC ) to form Wytec LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
for the purpose of transferring ownership of our five patents originally owned by Wytec International, Inc. into Wytec LLC. GPC
acts as the general member of the LLC and will assist in the monetization of the five patents. On September 20, 2016, GPC, the
Managing Partner of Wytec, LLC, assigned its partial ownership in the patents to Wytec, terminating the definitive agreement. 

Wytec s current product development involves
the continued design of the LPN-16 designed to meet the stringent bandwidth needs of both government  first responder 
services as well as  carrier offload  services. Management believes the LPN-16 solution is unique in Small Cell technology
with its multiple frequency  noninterference  characteristics. Small Cells as a Service ( SCaaS ) market
has been forecasted by SNS Research to reach $15 billion globally by 2020. In addition to the SCaaS market, management believes
the LPN-16 will support the needs of the massive growth of the machine to machine ( M2M ) market forecasted by SNS
Research to account for nearly $196 billion in global revenues by the end of 2020. 

Wytec s LPN-16 is proprietary intellectual
property of Wytec International, Inc for which management has applied for U.S. patent protection rights in the second quarter of
2014 and is a significant part of Wytec s Intelligent Community Wi-Fi Network ( IWiN ). We intend to file international
patent applications for the technology in the near future. Design and engineering of the LPN-16 have been completed with development
of the first units being tested in an outdoor environment in San Antonio, Texas. 

On June 9, 2012, our wholly owned subsidiary,
Wytec, formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Wylink, Inc., a Texas corporation, to market and sell millimeter wave spectrum in the
licensed 60   90 Gigahertz frequency channels. The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) has developed a unique
application program giving the ability for qualified applicants to own millimeter spectrum under a program known as the Registered
Link Program. We sell point-to-point registered links ( Registered Links ) as part of our backhaul solution in support
of our 4G/5G Wi-Fi network. The cash received from the sale of our Registered Links is recorded as  deferred revenue 
and will be recorded as revenue once the telecommunication equipment is installed for the link owners. Management closed the Wylink
application program in January 2016. 

Management now focuses its primary business
on the development of Smart City broadband networks utilizing 4G/5G technologies capable of delivering speeds that are many times
faster than current cellular networks and which can be utilized for a range of services for carriers, governmental and business
applications. 

Most recently, CCI management has developed
a strategic business plan to spin-off its subsidiary, Wytec into the public market. On July 31, 2016, Wytec completed its two
(2) year audit as a requirement to begin the process of filing a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We anticipate that each CCI shareholder will receive one share of Wytec common stock for every 388 shares of Wytec
common stock owned ( Spin-Off Shares ) and two Wytec common stock purchase warrants ( Spin-Off Warrants )
for each share of Wytec common stock received. The Spin-Off Warrants will be exercisable until December 31, 2018 at an exercise
price of $3.00 per share. The distribution of the Spin-Off Shares and Spin-Off Warrants is expected to occur on the date Wytec s
Registration Statement on Form S-1 becomes effective. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources, are based upon our financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates
its estimates and judgments, particularly those related to the determination of the estimated recoverable amounts of trade accounts
receivable, impairment of long-lived assets, revenue recognition and deferred tax assets. We believe the following critical accounting
policies require more significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. 

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments. Management specifically analyzes
the age of customer balances, historical bad debt experience, customer credit-worthiness, and changes in customer payment terms
when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances. If we determine that the financial conditions
of any of our customers deteriorated, whether due to customer specific or general economic issues, increases in the allowance may
be made. Accounts receivable are written off when all collection attempts have failed. 

We follow the provisions of Staff Accounting
Bulletin ( SAB ) 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements  for revenue recognition and SAB 104. Under
Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that
an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable and (iv)
collection is reasonably assured. 

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Under this method, to the extent that we believe that the deferred tax asset is not likely to be recovered,
a valuation allowance is provided. In making this determination, we consider estimated future taxable income and taxable timing
differences expected in the future. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Result of Operations for the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $115,226, as compared to revenue of $62,239 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in revenue
of $52,987 or 85% was primarily due to increases in sales from Capaciti Networks, Inc, and Wireless Wisconsin, LLC and a registered
link going live with Wytec International, Inc. 

Cost of sales for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $36,579, a decrease of $3,337, or 8%, from $39,916 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our cost of sales
decreased primarily due to managing costs related to our sales operations. 

General and administrative expenses were $1,775,081
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,283,670 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This resulted
in an increase of $491,411 or 38% compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in our general and administrative expenses
was largely a result of increased activity related to our link program costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Research and development costs were $5,942 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,438 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $496,
or 8% was due to a decrease in expenses related to the development of Wytec s LPN-16. 

Salary and wage expenses were $617,849 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $607,806 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which resulted
in an increase of $10,043, or 2% compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in salary and wages was due to an increase to
the compensation of the Company s chief executive officer during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $12,169, as compared to $133,946 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This resulted in a decrease
of $121,777 or 91% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the retirement of convertible and nonconvertible
debentures. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

While we have raised capital to meet our working
capital and financing needs in the past, additional financing will be required in order to meet our current and projected cash
requirements for operations. As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $144,035. As of September 30, 2016,
$2,210,000 of our current liabilities is deferred revenue on Link sales that have been funded by the customer, for which obligations
to the customer have not yet been completed. 

As of September 30, 2016, all our outstanding
convertible debentures mature within the next twelve months and are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet. 

We anticipate that we will incur operating
losses in the next twelve months. Our revenues are not expected to exceed our investment and operating costs in the next twelve
months. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
in their early stage of operations. To address these risks, we must, among other things, seek growth opportunities through investment
and acquisitions, effectively monitor and manage our claims for payments that are owed to us, implement and successfully execute
our business strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We cannot assure
that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business
prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations
for the Next 12 Months   

As of September 30, 2016, our cash balance
was $2,920,024. Our plan for satisfying our cash requirements for the next twelve months is through sales-generated income, private
placements of Wytec s capital stock, third party financing, and/or traditional bank financing. We anticipate sales-generated
income during that same period of time, but do not anticipate generating sufficient revenue to meet our working capital requirements.
Consequently, we intend to attempt to find sources of additional capital in the future to fund our growth and expansion through
additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities. There is no assurance that we would be able to meet our working capital
requirements through the private placement of equity or debt or from any other source. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

The Company has reviewed the updates issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, and determined
that the updates are either not applicable to the Company or will not have a material impact on the Company. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
About Market Risk.  

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Our chief executive officer and principal financial
officer, William Gray, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation,
our chief executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of September 30, 2016. Specifically, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely alerting
our management to material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in our
periodic SEC filings and ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief financial officer, or person performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, for the following reasons: 

We do not have an independent board of directors or audit committee or adequate segregation of duties.   

All of our financial reporting is generated by our financial consultant.   

We do not have an independent body to oversee our internal controls over financial reporting and lack segregation of duties due to the limited nature and resources of the Company.   

We have begun to rectify these weaknesses by
hiring additional accounting personnel and will create an independent board of directors once we have additional resources to do
so. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

Our chief executive officer and principal financial
officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their control objectives. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

The Company may be involved in legal actions
and claims arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time. As of the date of the report, there are no legal matters
of which management is aware. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

There have been no material changes from risk
factors previously disclosed in our annual Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.

Item 5. Other Information.  

On August 9, 2013, the Company s Board
of Directors authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman, William H. Gray on the later of (i) August 19, 2013 or (ii) upon recording of the Certificate of Designation for
the Series D Preferred Stock. 

On August 15, 2013, the Company filed a Certificate
of Designation for its Series D Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Nevada designating 100,000 shares of its authorized
preferred stock as Series D Preferred Stock. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock have a par value of $0.001 per share. The Series
D Preferred Stock does not have a dividend rate or liquidation preference and is not convertible into shares of common stock. 

For so long as any shares of the Series D Preferred
Stock remain issued and outstanding, the holders thereof, voting separately as a class, shall have the right, on or after August
15, 2013, to vote in an amount equal to 51% of the total vote (representing a super majority voting power) with respect to all
matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company. Such vote shall be determined by the holder(s) of a majority of
the then issued and outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock. For example, if there are 10,000 shares of the Company s
common stock issued and outstanding at the time of such shareholder vote, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, voting separately
as a class, will have the right to vote an aggregate of 10,408 shares, out of a total number of 20,408 shares voting. 

The shares of the Series D Preferred Stock
shall be automatically redeemed by the Company at their par value on the first to occur of the following: (i) on the date that
Mr. Gray ceases, for any reason, to serve as officer, director or consultant of the Company, or (ii) on the date that the Company s
shares of common stock first trade on any national securities exchange provided that the listing rules of any such exchange prohibit
preferential voting rights of a class of securities of the Company, or listing on any such national securities exchange is conditioned
upon the elimination of the preferential voting rights of the Series D Preferred Stock set forth in this Certificate of Designation. 

Additionally, the Company is prohibited from
adopting any amendments to the Company s Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation, as amended, making any changes to the Certificate
of Designation establishing the Series D Preferred Stock, or effecting any reclassification of the Series D Preferred Stock, without
the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The Company may, however, by any
means authorized by law and without any vote of the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock, make technical, corrective,
administrative or similar changes to such Certificate of Designation that do not, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect
the rights or preferences of the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock. 

This brief description of the Certificate
of Designation is only a summary of the material terms and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form
of the Certificate of Designation as attached to this Report on Form10-Q as Exhibit 3.4

1. Name of Corporation:

designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and relative rights of the following class or series of stock.

The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock is 100,000,000,
100,000 of which are hereby designated as  Series D Preferred Stock,  with the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions

Competitive Companies, Inc. 

3.       Voting 

3.1       Voting Rights.  The holders of the Series D Preferred
Stock will have the voting rights as described in this Section 3 or as required by law. For so long as any shares of the Series
D Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding, the holders thereof, voting separately as a class, shall have the right to vote
on all shareholder matters fifty-one percent (51%) of the total vote. Such vote shall be determined by the holder(s) of a majority
of the then issued and outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock. For example, if there are 10,000 shares of the Company's
common stock issued and outstanding at the time of a shareholder vote, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, voting separately
as a class, will have the right to vote an aggregate of 10,400 shares out of a total number of 20,400 shares voting. For the sake
of clarity and in an abundance of caution, the total voting shares outstanding at the time of any and all shareholder votes (i.e.,
the total shares eligible to vote on any and all shareholder matters) shall be deemed to include (a) the total shares of common
stock outstanding; (b) the voting rights applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, other than the Series D Preferred
Stock, if any; and (c) the voting rights attributable to the Series D Preferred Stock, as described herein, whether such Series
D Preferred Stock shares are voted or not. 

3.2       Amendments to Articles and Bylaws.  So long as
the Series D Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3%
of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class (i) amend, alter, or repeal any provision of
the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company so as to adversely affect the designations, preferences, limitations
and relative rights of the Series D Preferred Stock, (ii) effect any reclassification of the Series D Preferred Stock, excluding
a reverse stock split or forward split, or (iii) designate any additional series of preferred stock, the designation of which adversely
effects the rights, privileges, preferences or limitations of the Series D Preferred Stock set forth herein. 

3.3       Amendment of Rights of Series D Preferred Stock.  The
Company shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of all outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred
Stock, amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Statement of Designations, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company may, by any
means authorized by law and without any vote of the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, make technical, corrective,
administrative or similar changes in this Statement of Designations that do not, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect
the rights or preferences of the holders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock. 

4.  Liquidation Preference  

(a)       In
the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding
will be entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its shareholders, a preference (the
 Liquidation Preference ), whether from capital surplus or earnings, after any payment or declaration and setting apart
for payment of any amount is made with respect to the Class A, Class B, and Class C Preferred Stock of the Company and before any
payment or declaration and setting apart for payment of any amount is made with respect to the Common Stock of the Company. The
amount of the Liquidation Preference is $0.001 per share of then outstanding Series D Preferred Stock. After the payment of the
Liquidation Preference, the remaining assets of the Company legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably
among the holders of the Common Stock of the Company. 

(b)       The
following events shall be considered a liquidation under this Paragraph 4: 

(i)       any
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization,
in which the outstanding shares of the Company are exchanged for securities or other consideration issued by or on behalf of the
acquiring corporation or as a result of which the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction hold less than
50% of the equity securities of the surviving or resulting corporation, excluding any consolidation or merger effected exclusively
to change the domicile of the Company and any consolidation or merger affected exclusively with an entity that has no meaningful
business or operations for the purpose of creating a public market for the Company's Common Stock (an   Acquisition 
 or 

Certificate of Designation of Series D Preferred Stock, page 3 
Competitive Companies, Inc. 

(ii)       a
sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (an   Asset Transfer ).  

(c)       In
any of such events, if the consideration received is other than cash, its value will be deemed to be its fair market value as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any securities shall be valued as follows: 

(i)       Securities
not subject to investment letter or other similar restrictions on free marketability covered by (ii) below: 

(1)       If
traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
prices of the securities on such quotation system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of
such Acquisition or Asset Transfer; 

(2)       If
actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable)
over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such Acquisition or Asset Transfer; and 

(3)       If
there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors. 

(ii)       The
method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions
arising solely by virtue of a shareholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount
from the market value determined as above in (i) (I), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined
by the Board of Directors. 

5       Conversion
Rights  

The shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall have no conversion
rights. 

6.       Redemption Rights  

The shares of the Series
D Preferred Stock shall be automatically, and without any required action by the Company or the holders thereof, redeemed by the
Company at their par value on the first to occur of the following triggering events: (i) on the date that William H. Gray ceases,
for any reason, to serve as an officer or director of the Company, or (ii) on the date that the Company's common stock is listed
for trading on a national securities exchange such as the NASDAQ Small Cap Market, the NASDAQ National Market System, or a higher
listing. 

7.        Notices 

Any notice required by the provisions hereof to be given to the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock
shall be deemed given when personally delivered to such holder or five business days after the same has been deposited in the United
States mail, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at
his address appearing on the books of the Company.
