Note
1 - General   

My
Size Inc. (the  Company ) developed a unique measurement technology based on sophisticated algorithms with broad applications
in a variety of areas, from the apparel e-commerce market to Do It Yourself (DIY) smartphone   tablet apps. The technology
is driven by several patent-pending algorithms which are able to calculate and record measurements in a variety of novel ways.  

As of September 30, 2016 the Company
had consolidated net loss from continuing operations of $4,120 and a negative cash flow from operating activities in the sum of
$1,748 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of the date of the reports the Company entered into fund raising agreements
in a total sum of $7,815 out of which the sum of $4,257 was received in cash and marketable securities (DIMN shares). $3,558 was
received in checks and guarantee by an ungraded financial institution. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, an additional sum of
$400 was received in cash from the guarantees. As a result of these investments the Company anticipates meeting its obligations
for the next year. 

For the purpose of meeting its
obligations in the foreseeable future the Company relies on the exercise of the guarantees, sale of marketable securities and on
the exercise of the above mentioned documents. 

Note
2 - Significant Accounting Policies   

a.    Unaudited
                                         condensed consolidated financial statements:    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries collectively referred
to as the Company. In management's opinion, the interim financial data presented includes all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain information required by U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles has been condensed or omitted in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC. Operating results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future
period or for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

b.    Use
                                         of estimates:    

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially
from these estimates.  

c.  
      Impact of recently issued accounting standard not yet
adopted:   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01)  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of
the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. With respect to our consolidated financial
statements, the most significant impact relates to the recognition and measurement for equity investments. Additionally, ASU 2016-01
will impact the disclosure and presentation of financial assets and liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting
periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption by public entities is permitted
only for certain provisions.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02) which amends the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification and created Topic 842,  Leases.  Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet for most leases and provides for enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance
or operating. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December
15, 2018. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning
of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Full retrospective application is prohibited and early adoption
by public entities is permitted.

Note
3 - Financial Instruments   

Fair
value of financial instruments:  

ASC
820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.  

In
determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring
fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most
observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that
reflect the Company's assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed
based on the best information available in the circumstances.  

The
fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
when measuring fair value.  

As
a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used
in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  

Level
    1 -  
      Valuations
    based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments
    and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and
    regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.   

Level
    2 -  
      Valuations
    based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either
    directly or indirectly.   

Level
    3 -  
      Valuations
    based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.    

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, other accounts receivable, short-term loan, accounts payable and other accounts
payable approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of such instruments.

5 - Contingencies and Commitments    

a.    On
                                         December 27, 2015, the Company received a new claim. The defendants are the Company itself,
                                         all the members of the Board of Directors, Mrs. Shoshana Zigdon, a shareholder and related
                                         party in the Company, as well as two additional defendants who are not among the members
                                         of the Board of Directors of the Company, and are not shareholders. The cause of the
                                         claim is that the plaintiff alleges that the Company violated its obligation to register
                                         the shares for trade with the Stock Exchange, causing a total of 2,622,500 NIS damage.
                                         The plaintiff seeks relief against the defendants through financial compensation at the
                                         rate of the aforementioned alleged damage; additional compensation of 400,000 NIS due
                                         to mental anguish; and if and to the extent that until the time the plaintiff can sell
                                         its shares on the Stock Exchange (hereinafter:  the exercise date  ), the rate
                                         of a Company share will rise above the amount of 20.98 NIS (hereinafter:  the base
                                         rate ), an additional amount at the rate of the difference between the base rate
                                         and the highest rate of a Company share between the time the claim was submitted and
                                         the exercise date; and also court costs and attorney's fees of the plaintiff.

b.    On
January 24, 2016, the Company filed a Statement of Defense on its behalf and a Request for Stay of Proceedings due to Lis Alibi
Pendens (in view of the fact that at the same time the claim in the United States was still pending). In a decision dated February
15, 2016, it was held that a decision in the Company's Request for Stay of Proceedings would not be made at that stage and that
the pre-trial proceedings would continue to take place. The fact that the claim in the United States was deleted (as described
below), made the above Request redundant and it should have therefore been dismissed. On May 15, 2016, the plaintiff filed an
Application to dismiss the above Request and the Company did not object said Application.    

On
May 10, 2016, the claim which was filed by the Company in the United States against the plaintiffs was deleted at the parties'
consent without an order for costs.  

In
a pre-trial hearing dated March 7, 2016, the court decided that mutual disclosure of documents proceedings would take place and
disclosure affidavits along with copies of the documents specified therein were exchanged between the parties.  

Following
the recommendation of the court, on March 20, 2016, the plaintiff filed a notice of deletion of certain defendants including board
and management members excluding the chairman of the board and the general manager of the Company from the statement of claim.  

The parties completed preliminary
proceedings and initial affidavits were filed on June 10, 2016 by the plaintiff, including expert opinion regarding the financial
damage amounts claimed by the plaintiff. The date for filing initial affidavits of evidence, including expert opinion, on behalf
of the Company and the other defendants, has not arrived. 

The Company estimates, based on
the opinion of its legal advisers that the chances of acceptance of the remedy requested by the plaintiff in his claim, namely,
that the Company was obligated to remove the restriction which was imposed on the shares and register plaintiff's shares for trade
on the stock exchange, exceed the chances of its dismissal. 

At this stage, it is difficult
to assess the financial risk inherent in the plaintiff's claim, the proportion of the financial compensation claimed by the plaintiff
is derived from the method of calculating the damage and data relating to the company's share price and trading volumes of stock.
At this stage, the time for the submission of an expert opinion on behalf of the company for the calculation of the damage has
not arrived and the appropriate method of calculating the loss based on the circumstances in this case has not been determined. 

The provision the company recognized
in its financial statements for this claim is based in part on preliminary data which were obtained from a specialist hired by
the company. The Company's management believes that the provision in the reports is sufficient at this stage. 

On May 17, 2012, the Company signed an agreement for a convertible loan with a third party (hereinafter the  Investor ). In accordance with the loan agreement, the Company received a total of NIS 200 thousand with the signing of the loan agreement and was to receive an additional amount of NIS 100 thousand at the end of a period not exceeding 21 days, during which the investor would perform due diligence on the Company. In addition, the agreement was for additional investments up to a total of NIS 2 million.  

c. 
      Under the agreement, the investor were entitled to convert
the loan amounts granted to the Company into common shares of the Company with US $ 0.001 par value each, at a price per share
equal to the amount of NIS 0.97. If the loans were not converted into the Company shares, the loan was to be repaid one year after
the date of the loan agreement plus annual interest of 10%.   

On
February 18, 2015, the Company received a claim in a summary judgement for the investor s demand of payment of the loan
amount of NIS 200 thousand, which was granted to the Company on May 17, 2012, plus interest of 10% annually as from 20 May 2012
until payment of the debt, which as of the date of filing of the claim was NIS 258 thousand. The company denies the allegations
stated in the request and is reviewing the possibilities, including the filing of reply to the court in accordance with law.

5 - Contingencies and Commitments (cont d)   

On June 13, 2016, a settlement agreement
was entered into between the parties according to which in consideration for the final and conclusive annulment of all claims
and/or demands raised by the plaintiff against the Company in the framework of the law suit, the Company would pay the plaintiff
the sum of 250 thousand NIS forthwith by wire transfer of about 95 thousand NIS and by the forfeiture of the sum of about 155
thousand NIS which had been deposited with the court. An additional amount of 50 thousand NIS would be paid within twelve months
from the approval of the settlement agreement by the court or on the closing date of a public offering of Mysize shares, pursuant
to its terms, on a stock exchange in the United States, according to the earlier. As of the date on which the financial reports
were signed the terms have not yet occurred. 

d.    On
                                         September 10, 2015, the Company reported a claim that has been filed against it by its
                                         shareholders for not registering the shares underlying the Metamorefix transaction for
                                         trade on the TASE. Also, on September 10, 2015, the Company reported two letters of counterclaim
                                         that have been filed by it in the United States.    

On

5 - Contingencies and Commitments (cont d)   

The Company undertook that
not later than within six months from the date of execution of the Agreement, the Platform would be completed and operable, namely,
that the integration between the data systems of the parties would be completed and the end-customer would be able to take his
measurements and purchase a befitting product using the Platform. Should the Company fail to fulfill its undertakings under the
Agreement to grant the license and/or fully integrate the Platform within six months from the date of execution of the Agreement,
the Company shall compensate IN SITU in the sum of 60 thousand Euros. As a result of the extended timetable there is an understanding
between the parties to continue the cooperation. 

On November 10, 2013, the Company's board of directors approved to bring before the general meeting an engagement with one of the investors for the acquisition of rights in a venture for the accumulation of physical data of human beings by portable electronic devices for the purpose of locating, based on the accumulated data, articles of clothing in internet apparel stores, which will fit the person whose measurements were accumulated.  

g.    In
                                         consideration for the acquisition of the venture the Company will undertake to pay the
                                         seller 18% the Company's operational profit arising directly or indirectly from the venture
                                         during a period of seven years from the termination of the development period of the
                                         venture. In addition the Seller received an option for a buy-back of the venture upon
                                         the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (a) if an application was filed for
                                         the liquidation of the Company or for the appointment of a receiver for the Company's
                                         assets or any material part thereof or for the imposition of a lien on a material part
                                         of the Company's assets, which were not revoked within 60 days from the date they were
                                         so filed; (b) if by the end of seven years from the execution date of the agreement the
                                         entire aggregate income of the Company arising directly or indirectly from the venture
                                         or from the commercialization of the patent was lower than 3.6 million NIS. According
                                         to the Company's evaluation the value is negligible. The buy-back option is valid for
                                         90 days from the occurrence of either one of the above events. The agreed consideration
                                         was determined based on a valuation which was prepared by an independent assessor.    

The
Agreement was approved by the general meeting on January 9, 2014.

6 - Significant Events During The Reporting Period   

A.    On
                                         January 25, 2016 the warrants granted to all of the investors since February 2015 were
                                         amended. The exercise price of the warrants was changed from $4.50 USD to 18 NIS so that
                                         the exercise price is the same as the functional currency of the Company. This amendment
                                         of the exercise price to NIS changes the accounting for the warrants in accordance with
                                         ASC 470 and the warrants are recorded as additional paid-in-capital. When the warrant
                                         exercise price was in US dollars, which is not the Company s functional currency,
                                         the accounting rules required the Company to record the warrant option as a liability.
                                         The change in the exercise price was accounted for as payment of the current warrants
                                         and reissue of warrants which were classified as equity, in the sum of $1,041.    

B.    In
                                         November, 2015 the Company entered a collaboration agreement with Israel's largest private
                                         courier under which the parties will collaborate to develop an application based on the
                                         company's technology, which will allow the end customer to measure the size of packages
                                         intended for shipment and to receive details about the cost of sending the package, based
                                         on its size,. The collaboration agreement is for a period of up to six months, which
                                         may be extended by agreement of both parties or terminated by either party with prior
                                         notice of 14 days.    

On
March 27, 2016, the Company announced that it has completed the initial development of the app on Android and iOS devices. The
app has the ability to perform 3-D scan, photograph and obtain data on the time and location of the user. It should be clarified
that this is not the final version of the application and that the Company and the shipping company continue to collaborate for
further development and testing its integration  

On
July 4, 2016, the Company announced that it completed integration of the first app (beta) that it developed in the said affiliation
in the Katz Systems  

The
application uses the company's exclusive measuring algorithm and enables measuring the package's volume by moving the telephone
over the package. This information, and the package's barcode scan, picture and location,are sent to the information servers of
the Katz company and help in its pricing.  

On
7 November 2016 the company announced the launch of BoxSizeID app, which is an intuitive application that enables customers to
quickly and easily measure the size of a package and calculate the exact shipping cost. BoxSizeID also provides shipping companies
accurate logistic data to better manage the process of shipping packages before the packages reach their distribution centers.
The company is currently carrying out a pilot to implement BoxSizeID with Katz Deliveries.

                                         derivative   options held by the loan holder. Measured according to fair value
                                         over the entire reporting period.    

The
following table presents the data used to measure the fair value of the embedded derivative of the Company's shares according
to the Black   Scholes model with respect to the above plan:  

E.    On
                                         May 16, 2016, the Company appointed a trustee with respect to investment funds in the
                                         sum of 4.05 million dollars ($3,450 according to investor agreements signed in December
                                         2015 and February 2016). The trustee is required to transfer the funds to the Company
                                         on demand of the company. During the month of July, 2016, the company received the money
                                         from investors through cash and guarantee by an ungraded financial institution, respectively,
                                         such that the trust agreements that were noted are not in effect.    

F.    Following
                                         the investment agreements which were executed by the Company in December 2015, and February
                                         2016, (as described in note 8b and 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for December
                                         31, 2015) in a total amount of $3,450 in April, 2016, the Company signed a loan repayment
                                         extension for a two year period until March 31, 2018. The above loan repayment extension
                                         was executed by the repayment of the existing instruments and the re-issue of a loan
                                         consisting of a commitment component and a conversion component. In addition, following
                                         its receipt of Nasdaq's listing approval on June 10, 2016, the Company converted loans
                                         into capital as described in note 4K. As a result of the above repayment of the existing
                                         instruments and the re-issue of the loans, the Company accrued financing costs in the
                                         sum of about $57.

DIAMANTE
MINERALS INC is engaged in exploration, development and operation of a diamond project. As of the date of the release of the financial
statement the value of DIMN shares was $506. 

H .    In
                                         May, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the Company's offers with private investors
                                         for convertible loan agreements whereby the investors will provide a loan for a total
                                         amount of $1,055, which does not bear interest, and which is convertible into common
                                         shares of the Company. The loans are convertible into 301,426 shares until March 31,
                                         2018 at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. In addition, the Company will issue non-negotiable
                                         warrants convertible into 301,426 ordinary shares of the Company until March 31, 2018
                                         at an exercise price of NIS 18 per share. From the above agreements the Company received,
                                         as of the certification date of the reports, about $560 in cash and about $495 in three
                                         checks. Accordingly, on September 5, 2016, the Company issued 159,998 shares and options
                                         in exchange for payment the payment of $560.    

On
the date of its receipt of the loan amounts were attributed to three components:  

(1)    Equity
                                         options to Company shares   measured according to the fair value on the measurement

J .    On
                                         June 10, 2016, the Company was notified that its listing application on Nasdaq had been
                                         approved.    

The
shares began trading on July 25,2016. Accordingly, the Company's convertible loans were converted into capital during the reporting
period. On July 14, 2016, the Company's board of directors resolved to act according to the provisions of the convertible loan
agreements which were signed by the Company and to carry out an automatic conversion of the loans into Company shares subject
to its receipt of the consideration and the approvals required by law. Accordingly, after the reporting date, the Company actually
issued the shares for the convertible loans the allotment of which had been approved by the stock exchange and the consideration
for which had been received. As of September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,091,566 shares for convertible loans received by it
in the sum of $7,320.  

K.    During
                                         the nine months period which ended on September 30, 2016, the Company had financial expenses
                                         mainly due creation and revaluation of the components of the options and derivatives.
                                         The Company has immaterial expenses for rate of exchange differentials and bank charges.    

L.    On
                                         August 10, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved the updated employment terms
                                         of the following officers: for Mr. Eli Walles (chairman of the board) and Ms. Billy Prado
                                         (VP Products) an updated salary of NIS 35,000 per month plus employer's cost, and for

7 - Subsequent Events   

Pro-forma
equity  

As described in Note 1 above, as
of September 30, 2016 the Company entered into fund raising agreements in a total sum of $7,815 out of which the sum of $4,258
was received in cash and $3,557 was received in checks and guarantee by an ungraded financial institution. Subsequent to September
30, 2016, an additional sum of $400 was received in cash from the bank guarantees. 

The
following proforma consolidated balance sheet is based on the September 30, 2016 balance sheet with adjustments for receipt of
$3,157 from investors for stock subscribed.  

The effect on equity and on the
assets of collecting the money from the bank guarantees and the checks is an increase of $3,157, As a result, the Company s
stockholder s equity, on a pro forma basis, is $4,614 as of September 30, 2016. 

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

You
should read the following discussion along with our financial statements and the related notes included in this report. The following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those discussed
under  Risk Factors  in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our actual results, performance
and achievements may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.    

Results
of Operations   

Nine
and three months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine and three months Ended September 30, 2015   

From
inception through September 30, 2016, we have sustained an accumulated deficit of approximately $11.3 million. From
inception through September 30, 2016, we have not generated any revenue from operations and expect to incur additional losses
to perform further research and development activities and do not currently have any commercial products. Our product development
efforts are thus in their early stages and we cannot make estimates of the costs or the time they will take to complete.   

Research
and Development Expenses    

Our
research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $500,000 compared to $217,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase between the corresponding periods primarily results from increased subcontractors
expenses and the increased expenses associated with the hiring of new employees.  

Our research and development expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $172,000 compared to $112,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
between the corresponding periods primarily results from increased subcontractors expenses and the increased expenses associated
with the hiring of new employees.   

Marketing,
General and Administrative Expenses    

Our
marketing, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $1,359,000 compared to
$1,128,000 (including approximately $300,000 in expenses for options granted to consultants) for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase between the corresponding periods in expenses derives mainly from increases in the Company's operating
activity.  

Our
marketing, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $434,000 compared
to $364,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase between the corresponding periods in expenses derives
mainly from increases in the Company's operating activity.  

Financial
income and expense, net    

Our financial expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $2,261,000 compared to financial expense of $1,526,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase between the corresponding periods in financial expenses derives mainly from the creation and revaluation
of the components of the options, derivatives and marketable securities. 

Our financial expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $118,000 compared to financial expense of $1,138,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease between the corresponding periods is mainly due to elimination of derivatives. 

Net
Loss from continuing operations    

As
a result of the foregoing research and development, marketing general and administrative expenses, and financial expenses, our
net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,120,000, compared to our net loss from
continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $2,871,000. The main reason for the change between the corresponding
periods is the increase in the Company's operating activity and the financial expenses mainly from the creation and revaluation
of the components of the financial package.  

Our
net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $724,000, compared to our net loss from
continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,614,000. The decrease between the corresponding periods
is the increase in the Company's operating activity and the financial expenses mainly from the creation and revaluation of the
components of the financial package.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Since
our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through private offerings of our equity securities in Israel.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $143,000 as compared to $919,000 as of December 31, 2015. The decrease
in cash balances is due to cash used for operating activities during the period.  

We
had negative cash flow from operating activities of $1,748,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with negative
cash flow from operating activities of $913,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
increase in cash used in operating activities derives from increased payments to service providers and Company employees. The
Company has expenses not in the ordinary course of business mainly from the registration of patents, the listing of our common
stock on Nasdaq and legal expenses associated with lawsuits involving the Company.  

We
had negative cash flow from investing activities of $31,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with negative
cash flow from investing activities of $21,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The negative cash flow resulted from
purchase of equipment.  

We
had positive cash flow from financing activities of $1,018,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,937,000
for the nine months Ended September 30, 2015. The cash flow from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 was mainly due to the issuance of a convertible loan and options.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company entered into fund raising agreements in a total sum of $7,815,000 out of which the sum of $4,258,000
was received in cash and marketable securities (DIMN shares). $3,557,000 was received in, checks and guarantee by an ungraded
financial institution. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, an additional sum of $400,000 was received in cash from the guarantees.

We
believe that our available cash, together with the amounts available to us under the bank guarantees, is sufficient capital to
carry out our intended objectives during the next 20 months. To the extent we are unable to collect on the bank guarantees currently
available to us or our intended objectives change, we will require additional financing to carry out our intended plan of operations.
There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will be available or, if it is available, that we will be able to structure
such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements until we can reach a level
of profitable operations and positive cash flows. We currently have no firm commitments for any additional capital.  

A
downturn in the United States stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of
equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs
and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to
seek alternative financing. Further, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional
dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares
of common stock or the debt securities may cause us to be subject to restrictive covenants. Even if we are able to raise the funds
required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or
experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek additional financing. If additional financing is not
available or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to curtail our operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities in which we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained
interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities
or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market
risk or credit risk support.  

Application
of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
report, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to our financial results and to the understanding
of our past and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s estimates
and assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because information
was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making our estimate; and (2)
changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  

Research
and development expenses    

Research
expenses are recognized as expenses when incurred. Costs incurred on development projects are recognized as intangible assets
as of the date as of which it can be established that it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will
flow to us considering its commercial feasibility. This is generally the case when regulatory approval for commercialization is
achieved and costs can be measured reliably. Given the current stage of the development of our products, no development expenditures
have yet been capitalized. Intellectual property-related costs for patents are part of the expenditure for the research and development
projects. Therefore, registration costs for patents are expensed when incurred as long as the research and development project
concerned does not meet the criteria for capitalization.  

Equity-based
compensation    

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation  ( ASC
718 ) which requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing
model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite
service periods in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  

The
Company recognizes compensation expenses for the value of its awards granted based on the accelerated method over the requisite
service period of each of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of
grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

The
Company selected the Binomial option pricing model ( the Binomial model ) as the most appropriate fair value method
for its stock-options awards. The Binomial model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the suboptimal
exercise factor and expected stock price volatility. The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated based on employees' historical
option exercise behavior.  

The
suboptimal exercise factor is the ratio by which the stock price must increase over the exercise price before employees are expected
to exercise their stock options.  

The
expected volatility of the share prices reflects the assumption that the historical volatility of the share prices is reasonably
indicative of expected future trends.  

The
expected option term represents the period that the Company's stock options are expected to be outstanding. The Company currently
uses simplified method until sufficient historical exercise data will support using expected life assumptions. The risk-free interest
rate is based on the yield from Israel treasury zero-coupon bonds with an equivalent term.  

The
Company has historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay dividends.  

The
Company applies ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  with respect to options and warrants issued to
non-employees.  

If
any of the assumptions used in the binomial model change significantly, equity-based compensation for future awards may differ
materially compared with the awards granted previously.  

Convertible
promissory notes:    

The
Company applies ASC 470-20,  Debt with Conversion and Other Options  ( ASC 470-20 ). Under the guidelines
of ASC 470-20, the Company measures and recognizes the beneficial conversion feature on the commitment date. The beneficial conversion
feature is measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of the feature to additional paid-in-capital.
The intrinsic value of the feature is calculated on the commitment date using the conversion price. This intrinsic value is limited
to the portion of the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt.  

The
Company applied ASC 470-20 and ASC 815 to the Convertible promissory notes.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

We
carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above.
Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements
due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  

Changes
in Internal Controls   

During
the most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Part
II   Other Information   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time
to time that may harm our business.  

We
are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings except as described below.  

On
December 27, 2015, the Company received a new claim. The defendants are the Company itself, all the members of the Board of Directors,
Mrs. Shoshana Zigdon, a shareholder and related party in the Company, as well as two additional defendants who are not among the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company, and are not shareholders. The cause of the claim is that the plaintiff alleges
that the Company violated its obligation to register the shares for trade with the Stock Exchange, causing a total of 2,622,500
NIS damage. The plaintiff seeks relief against the defendants through financial compensation at the rate of the aforementioned
alleged damage; additional compensation of 400,000 NIS due to mental anguish; and if and to the extent that until the time the
plaintiff can sell its shares on the Stock Exchange (hereinafter:  the exercise date  ), the rate of a Company share
will rise above the amount of 20.98 NIS (hereinafter:  the base rate ), an additional amount at the rate of the difference
between the base rate and the highest rate of a Company share between the time the claim was submitted and the exercise date;
and also court costs and attorney's fees of the plaintiff.  

On January 24, 2016, the Company filed a Statement of Defense on its behalf and a Request for Stay of
Proceedings due to Lis Alibi Pendens (in view of the fact that at the same time the claim in the United States was still pending).
In a decision dated February 15, 2016, it was held that a decision in the Company's Request for Stay of Proceedings would not be
made at that stage and that the pre-trial proceedings would continue to take place. The fact that the claim in the United States
was deleted (as described below), made the above Request redundant and it should have therefore been dismissed. On May 15, 2016,
the plaintiff filed an Application to dismiss the above Request and the Company did not object said Application. On May 10, 2016,
the claim which was filed by the Company in the United States against the plaintiffs was deleted at the parties' consent without
an order for costs. In a pre-trial hearing dated March 7, 2016, the court decided that mutual disclosure of documents proceedings
would take place and disclosure affidavits along with copies of the documents specified therein were exchanged between the parties.
Following the recommendation of the court, on March 20, 2016, the plaintiff filed a notice of deletion of certain defendants including
board and management members excluding the chairman of the board and the general manager of the Company from the statement of claim. 

The parties completed preliminary proceedings
and initial affidavits were filed on June 10, 2016 by the plaintiff, including expert opinion regarding the financial damage amounts
claimed by the plaintiff. The date for filing initial affidavits of evidence, including expert opinion, on behalf of the Company
and the other defendants, has not arrived. 

The Company estimates, based on the opinion of its legal advisers that the chances of acceptance of the remedy
requested by the plaintiff in his claim, namely, that the Company was obligated to remove the restriction which was imposed on
the shares and register plaintiff's shares for trade on the stock exchange, exceed the chances of its dismissal. 

At this stage, it is difficult to assess the financial risk inherent in the plaintiff's claim, the proportion of the financial
compensation claimed by the plaintiff is derived from the method of calculating the damage and data relating to the company's share
price and trading volumes of stock. At this stage, the time for the submission of an expert opinion on behalf of the company for
the calculation of the damage has not arrived and the appropriate method of calculating the loss based on the circumstances in
this case has not been determined. 

The provision the company recognized in its financial statements for this claim is based in part on preliminary data which were
obtained from a specialist hired by the company. The Company's management believes that the provision in the reports is sufficient
at this stage. 

On
May 17, 2012, the Company signed an agreement for a convertible loan with a third party (hereinafter the  Investor ).
In accordance with the loan agreement, the Company received a total of NIS 200 thousand with the signing of the loan agreement
and was to receive an additional amount of NIS 100 thousand at the end of a period not exceeding 21 days, during which the investor
would perform due diligence on the Company. In addition, the agreement was for additional investments up to a total of NIS 2 million.
Under the agreement, the investor were entitled to convert the loan amounts granted to the Company into common shares of the Company
with US $ 0.001 par value each, at a price per share equal to the amount of NIS 0.97. If the loans were not converted into the
Company shares, the loan was to be repaid one year after the date of the loan agreement plus annual interest of 10%. On February
18, 2015, the Company received a claim in a summary judgement for the investor s demand of payment of the loan amount of
NIS 200 thousand, which was granted to the Company on May 17, 2012, plus interest of 10% annually as from 20 May 2012 until payment
of the debt, which as of the date of filing of the claim was NIS 258 thousand. The company denies the allegations stated in the
request and is reviewing the possibilities, including the filing of reply to the court in accordance with law.  

On June 13, 2016,
a settlement agreement was entered into between the parties according to which in consideration for the final and conclusive annulment
of all claims and/or demands raised by the plaintiff against the Company in the framework of the law suit, the Company would pay
the plaintiff the sum of 250 thousand NIS forthwith by wire transfer of about 95 thousand NIS and by the forfeiture of the sum
of about 155 thousand NIS which had been deposited with the court. An additional amount of 50 thousand NIS would be paid within
twelve months from the approval of the settlement agreement by the court or on the closing date of a public offering of Mysize
shares, pursuant to its terms, on a stock exchange in the United States, according to the earlier. As of the date on which the
financial reports were signed the terms have not yet occurred.  

On
September 10, 2015, the Company reported a claim that has been filed against it by its shareholders for not registering the shares
underlying the Metamorefix transaction for trade on the TASE. Also, on September 10, 2015, the Company reported two letters of
counterclaim that have been filed by it in the United States. On November 6, 2015, the Company reported another letter of claim
filed by it with the Tel-Aviv District Court. According to a decision dated March 22, 2016, affidavits of primary testimony were
filed on behalf of the litigants and on July 18-19, 2016, evidentiary hearings were held in the above case.  

On
January 16, 2014, the Company received from the legal counsel of one of its shareholders a demand letter for the payment of about
$1,400 as compensation for alleged breaches by several parties including the Company and its previous controlling shareholder
(who is not the current controlling shareholder of the Company) of an allotment agreement between the Company and its previous
controlling shareholder and shareholders of Metamorefix. The execution of the allotment agreement was completed in December 2011
and thereafter, in January 2013, the entire share capital of Metamorefix was sold by the Company. A response letter was sent
by the Company which stated that the Company did not consider itself as a party to the allegations which were raised in said letter
and that in any event all such allegations were denied by it. The Company did not make an allowance in the reports in connection
with said demand.  

On
November 14, 2014, the Company entered into a cooperation agreement for a period of six months with IN SITU S.A. (hereinafter
respectively: the  Agreement  and  IN SITU ) the owner of the rights in the fashion brand-name TRUCCO, which
includes women's fashion, belts and footwear and which is marketed and sold all over the world by IN SITU through a chain of stores
and sale points as well as through TRUCCO's website (hereinafter: the  Website ). According to the Agreement IN SITU
and the Company will cooperate in a bid to integrate the Company's measurement technology (hereinafter: the  Platform )
in IN SITU's computerized data system and any other system which would enable to use the Platform on the Website as well as in
the store and sale points for the examination of the Platform's efficiency in relation to IN SITU's sales and customers' satisfaction.
The Company undertook that not later than within six months from the date of execution of the Agreement, the Platform would be
completed and operable, namely, that the integration between the data systems of the parties would be completed and the end-customer
would be able to take his measurements and purchase a befitting product using the Platform. Should the Company fail to fulfill
its undertakings under the Agreement to grant the license and/or fully integrate the Platform within six months from the date
of execution of the Agreement, the Company shall compensate IN SITU in the sum of 60 thousand Euros. As a result of the extended
timetable there is an understanding between the parties to continue the cooperation.

2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

On July 14, 2016, the Company's board of directors
resolved to act according to the provisions of the convertible loan agreements which were signed by the Company and to carry out
an automatic conversion of the loans into Company shares subject to its receipt of the consideration and the approvals required
by law. The Company issued the shares for the convertible loans the allotment of which had been approved by the stock exchange
and the consideration for which had been received. As of September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,091,566 shares for convertible
loans received by it in the sum of $7,320. In connection with the sale of these shares, the Company relied upon the exemption
from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for transactions not involving a public
offering.
