NOTE 1   DESC  RIPTION OF  B USINESS
AND GOING CONCERN  

MetaStat, Inc. ( we,   us, 
 our,  the  Company,  or
 MetaStat ) is a pre-commercial molecular diagnostic
company focused on the development and commercialization of novel
diagnostics to provide physicians and patients actionable
information regarding the risk of systemic metastasis and adjuvant
chemotherapy treatment decisions. We believe cancer treatment
strategies can be personalized and outcomes improved through new
diagnostic tools that identify the aggressiveness and metastatic
potential of primary tumors. The Company was incorporated on March
28, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MetaStat
Biomedical, Inc., a Delaware corporation and all significant
intercompany balances have been eliminated by
consolidation. 

These interim unaudited financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles ( GAAP ) in the United States and should be
read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated
financial statements and related footnotes for the year ended
February 29, 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) on May 31, 2016. These unaudited
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary for a fair presentation of the
Company s financial position as of August 31, 2016 and its
results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods
presented and are not necessarily indicative of results for
subsequent interim periods or for the full year. These interim
financial statements do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and
allowed by the relevant SEC rules and regulations; however, the
Company believes that its disclosures are adequate to ensure that
the information presented is not misleading. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has experienced net losses and negative
cash flows from operations since its inception.  The
Company has sustained cumulative losses of approximately $25.5
million as of August 31, 2016, has a negative working capital and
has not generated revenues or positive cash flows from
operations. The continuation of the Company as a going concern
is dependent upon continued financial support from its
shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity
and/or debt financing to continue operations, and the attainment of
profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt
regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional
financings will be available to it and, if available, completed on
a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company
is unable to complete a debt or equity offering, or otherwise
obtain sufficient financing when and if needed, it would negatively
impact its business and operations and could also lead to the
reduction or suspension of the Company s operations and
ultimately force the Company to cease operations. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. 

Subsequent to August 31, 2016, the Company completed closings of
the Additional Unit Private Placement (as defined in Note 3),
whereby the Company issued an aggregate of 135   units for 192,000   shares of common stock, 48,300 shares of its
Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible into 483,000
shares of common stock, and five-year common stock purchase
warrants to purchase 337,500 shares of common stock with an
exercise price of $3.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of
$1.35 million   and net proceeds
of approximately $1.23 million.  See Note 12-Subsequent
Events.

NOTE 2   CAPITAL STOCK 

The Company has authorized 160,000,000 shares of capital stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of which 150,000,000 are shares of common
stock and 10,000,000 are shares of  blank-check 
preferred stock. 

Our Board is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue
preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or
other rights, which could adversely affect the voting power or
other rights of the holders of common stock. The preferred stock
could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or
preventing a change in control of the Company. 

Common Stock 

The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share.
In addition, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to
receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by our
Board out of legally available funds; however, the current policy
of our Board is to retain earnings, if any, for operations and
growth. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of
our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in all assets
that are legally available for distribution. 

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 

Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Rights and
Preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (the  Series A
Certificate of Designation ), the terms of the Series A
Preferred Stock are as follows: 

Ranking 

The Series A Preferred Stock will rank senior to our common stock
with respect to distributions of assets upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company. 

Dividends 

The Series A Preferred Stock is not entitled to any
dividends. 

Liquidation Rights 

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the
assets of the Company, whether such assets are capital or surplus,
for each share of Series A Preferred Stock an amount equal to the
fair market value as determined in good faith by the
Board. 

Voluntary Conversion; Anti-Dilution Adjustments 

Each fifteen (15) shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
convertible into one share of common stock (the  Series A
Conversion Ratio ). The Series A Conversion Ratio is subject
to customary adjustments for issuances of shares of common stock as
a dividend or distribution on shares of the common stock, or
mergers or reorganizations. 

Voting Rights 

The Series A Preferred Stock has no voting rights. The common stock
into which the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible shall, upon
issuance, have all of the same voting rights as other issued and
outstanding common stock, and none of the rights of the Series A
Preferred Stock.

Series B Convertible Preferred Stock 

Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Rights and
Preferences of the Series B Preferred Stock (the  Series B
Certificate of Designation ), the terms of the Series B
Preferred Stock are as follows: 

Ranking 

The Series B Preferred Stock will rank senior to the Series A
Preferred Stock and common stock with respect to distributions of
assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company. 

Stated Value 

Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will have a stated value of
$5,500, subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations and
similar events (the  Stated Value ). 

Dividends 

Cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock accrue at the
rate of 8% of the Stated Value per annum, payable quarterly on
March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, from
and after the date of the initial issuance.  Dividends
are payable in kind in additional shares of Series B Preferred
Stock valued at the Stated Value or in cash at the sole option of
the Company. At August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the dividend
payable to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock amounted to
approximately $48,812 and $48,317, respectively. During the three
and six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company issued 13.4407
and 26.6178 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, for
payment of dividends amounting to $73,925 and $146,399. During the
three and six months ended August 31, 2015, the Company issued
12.4175 and 17.2354 shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
respectively, for payment of dividends amounting to $68,295 and
$94,793. 

Liquidation Rights 

If the Company voluntarily or involuntarily liquidates, dissolves
or winds up its affairs, each holder of the Series B Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive out of the Company s assets
available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of
liabilities to creditors, if any, but before any distribution of
assets is made on the Series A Preferred Stock or common stock or
any of the Company s shares of stock ranking junior as to
such a distribution to the Series B Preferred Stock, a liquidating
distribution in the amount of the Stated Value of all such
holder s Series B Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon. At August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the
value of the liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock
aggregated to approximately $3.7 million and $3.7 million,
respectively. 

Conversion; Anti-Dilution Adjustments 

Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible at the
holder s option into common stock in an amount equal to the
Stated Value plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon through the
conversion date divided by the then applicable conversion price.
The initial conversion price was $8.25 per share (the  Series
B Conversion Price ) and is subject to customary adjustments
for issuances of shares of common stock as a dividend or
distribution on shares of common stock, or mergers or
reorganizations, as well as  full ratchet 
anti-dilution adjustments for future issuances of other Company
securities (subject to certain standard carve-outs) at prices less
than the applicable Series B Conversion Price. 

The issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the 2016 Unit
Private Placement (as defined in Note 3) triggered the full ratchet
anti-dilution price protection provision of the Series B Preferred
Stock. Accordingly, the Series B Conversion Price was adjusted from
$8.25 to $2.00 per share. See Note 3 for the accounting treatment
of the conversion price adjustment.

The Series B Preferred Stock is subject to automatic conversion
(the  Mandatory Conversion ) at such time when the
Company s common stock has been listed on a national stock
exchange such as the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange or NYSE MKT;
provided, that, on the Mandatory Conversion date, a registration
statement providing for the resale of the shares of common stock
underlying the Series B Preferred Stock is effective. In the event
of a Mandatory Conversion, each share of Series B Preferred Stock
will convert into the number of shares of common stock equal to the
Stated Value plus accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the
applicable Series B Conversion Price. 

Voting Rights 

On March 27, 2015, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock
entered into an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Purchase
Agreement, whereby the Company filed an Amended and Restated Series
B Preferred Certificate of Designation. The Amended and Restated
Series B Preferred Certificate of Designation provides that the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the
number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into
which such Series B Preferred Stock could be converted for purposes
of determining the shares entitled to vote at any regular, annual
or special meeting of stockholders of the Company, and shall have
voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of
the common stock (voting together with the common stock as a single
class). 

Most Favored Nation 

For a period of up to 30 months after March 31, 2015, if the
Company issues any New Securities (as defined below) in a private
placement or public offering (a  Subsequent
Financing ), the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may
exchange all of the Series B Preferred Stock at their Stated Value
plus all Series A Warrants (as defined below) issued to the
Series B Preferred Stock investors in the Series B Private
Placement for the securities issued in the Subsequent Financing on
the same terms of such Subsequent Financing.  This right
expires upon the earlier of (i) September 30, 2017 and (ii) the
consummation of a bona fide underwritten public offering in which
the Company receives aggregate gross proceeds of at least
$5,000,000.  New Securities  means shares of the
common stock, any other securities, options, warrants or other
rights where upon exercise or conversion the purchaser or recipient
receives shares of the common stock, or other securities with
similar rights to the common stock, subject to certain standard
carve-outs. 

See Note 3 for the accounting treatment of the Series B Preferred
Stock. 

NOTE 3   EQUITY ISSUANCES 

Common stock financing   the 2016 Unit Private
Placement 

During the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company entered
into a subscription agreement pursuant to a private placement (the
 2016 Unit Private Placement ) with a number of
accredited investors pursuant to which the Company issued units for
an offering price of $10,000 per unit, with each unit consisting of
(i) 5,000 shares of its common stock, and (ii) five-year warrants
(the  Warrants ) to purchase 2,500 shares of common
stock (the  Warrant Shares ), at an exercise price of
$3.00 per share. 

First Closing of the 2016 Unit Private Placement 

On May 26, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 20 units
consisting of an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock and
50,000 Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000. After
deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses,
including legal expenses, net proceeds amounted to approximately
$126,000. Additionally, the Company issued an aggregate of 10,000
placement agent warrants in substantially the same form as the
Warrants.

Second and Final Closing of the 2016 Unit Private
Placement 

On June 8, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 29.5 units
consisting of an aggregate of 147,500 shares of common stock and
73,750 Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $295,000. After
deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, the
Company received net proceeds of approximately $264,000.
Additionally, the Company issued an aggregate of 14,750 placement
agent warrants in substantially the same form as the
Warrants. 

Registration Rights Agreement 

Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into by the
parties, the Company agreed to file a registration statement with
the SEC providing for the resale of the shares of common stock and
the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants issued pursuant
to the 2016 Unit Private Placement on or before the date which is
forty-five (45) days after the date of the final closing of the
2016 Unit Private Placement.  The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement
to become effective within one hundred fifty (150) days from the
filing date. The Company has received a waiver from a majority of
the 2016 Unit Private Placement investors extending the filing date
of the registration statement to no later than November 21,
2016. 

Most Favored Nation Exchange   the MFN Exchange 

On July 12, 2016, the Company and one Series B Preferred Stock
shareholder (the  Exchange Purchaser ) entered into an
exchange agreement effective July 1, 2016 (the  Exchange
Agreement ) whereby the Exchange Purchaser elected to
exercise their Most Favored Nation exchange right into the
securities offered pursuant to the 2016 Unit Private Placement (the
 MFN Exchange ). Accordingly, the Exchange
Purchaser tendered all of their 19.4837 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and $2,143 of accrued and unpaid dividends for an
aggregate exchange amount of $109,304, plus 9,000 Series A Warrants
with an exercise price of $10.50 per share originally issued in
connection with the Series B Private Placement for an aggregate of
54,652 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 27,326
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share.
Additionally, the parties entered into a joinder agreement, and the
Exchange Purchaser was granted all rights and benefits under the
2016 Unit Private Placement financing agreements. 

The Company analyzed and determined that the MFN Exchange is a
contingent beneficial conversion feature that should be recognized
upon the occurrence of the contingent event based on its intrinsic
value at the commitment date. Since the Company had fully
recognized all allocated proceeds of the Series B Preferred Stock
in previously recognized beneficial conversion features, no
beneficial conversion was recognized upon the exchange of the
Series B Preferred Stock in the MFN Exchange. 

For the three and six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company has
recorded a non-cash deemed dividend to Additional Paid-in Capital
of $29,311 in connection with the MFN Exchange equal to the excess
fair value of the warrants received over the fair value of the
Series A Warrants. 

Common stock financing   Additional Unit Private
Placement 

First Closing of the Additional Unit Private Placement 

On August 31, 2016, the Company entered into a subscription
agreement pursuant to a private placement (the  Additional
Unit Private Placement ) with an accredited investor pursuant
to which the Company issued an aggregate of 8.75 units consisting
of an aggregate of 43,750 shares of common stock at an effective
price of $2.00 per share (the  Effective Price ) and
five-year warrants to purchase 21,875 shares of common stock at a
purchase price of $3.00 per share (the  Warrants ) for
an aggregate purchase price of $87,500. After deducting placement
agent fees and other offering expenses, including legal expenses,
net proceeds amounted to approximately $73,000. Additionally, the
Company issued an aggregate of 438 placement agent warrants in
substantially the same form as the Warrants. 

Pursuant to the subscription agreement, for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days following the final closing of the Additional
Unit Private Placement, the investors shall have
 full-ratchet  anti-dilution price protection (the
 Price Protection ) based on certain issuances by the
Company of common stock or securities convertible into shares of
common stock at an effective price per share less than the
Effective Price (a "Down-round Issuance"), whereby the Company
would be required to issue the investors additional shares of
common stock and Warrants.

Accounting for the Price Protection Provision 

The Company analyzed the Price Protection provision for embedded
derivatives that require bifurcation. The Company evaluated the
Price Protection provision for both the issuance of additional
shares of common stock and additional Warrants in connection with a
Down-round Issuance in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815. In
connection with the potential issuance of additional shares of
common stock, the Company concluded that since the embedded
down-round feature is within the equity host contract, the embedded
Price Protection provision would be considered clearly and closely
related to the equity host under ASC 815-15-25-1(a) and that the
Price Protection provision should not be bifurcated. In connection
with the potential issuance of additional Warrants, the Company
concluded that the freestanding Warrants are not indexed to the
Company s common stock within the scope of ASC 815-40 and
therefore was initially bifurcated and measured at fair value and
recorded as a derivative liability in the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet.  The derivative liability will be measured
at fair value on an ongoing basis, with changes in fair value
recognized in the statement of operations. 

Issuances of common stock for services

Series B preferred stock financing   the Series B Private
Placement 

The Company entered into an amended and restated securities
purchase agreement (the  A R Series B Purchase
Agreement ) on March 27, 2015 and March 31, 2015 with a
number of new and existing accredited investors (collectively, the
 Series B Investors ) pursuant to which it sold
$2,130,750 of Series B Preferred Stock convertible into common
stock at $8.25 per share in a private placement (the  Series
B Private Placement ).  In addition, pursuant to
the A R Series B Purchase Agreement, the Company issued series
A warrants (the  Series A Warrants ) to purchase up to
193,708 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price per
share of $20.50 to the Series B Investors. The Series A Warrants
expire on March 31, 2020.

In connection with the March 2015 closings of the Series B Private
Placement, the placement agents were paid a total cash fee of
$147,451 including expense allowances and reimbursements, and were
issued an aggregate of 20,668 Series A Warrants. On the grant
dates, the fair value of the placement agent warrants amounted to
$158,441 and was recorded as a stock issuance cost. Net proceeds
amounted to $1,945,244 after deducting offering expenses to be paid
in cash, including the placement agent fees and legal fees and
other expenses. 

Accounting for the Series B Preferred Stock 

The Company determined the Series B Preferred Stock should be
classified as equity as it is not mandatorily redeemable, and there
are no unconditional obligations in that the Company must or may
settle in a variable number of its equity shares. 

Because the Series B Preferred Stock contain certain embedded
features that could affect the ultimate settlement of the Series B
Preferred Stock, the Company analyzed the instrument for embedded
derivatives that require bifurcation. The Company s analysis
began with determining whether the Series B Preferred Stock is more
akin to equity or debt.  The Company evaluated the
following criteria/features in this determination: redemption,
voting rights, collateral requirements, covenant provisions,
creditor and liquidation rights, dividends, conversion rights and
exchange rights. The Company determined that the preponderance of
evidence suggests the Series B Preferred Stock was more akin to
equity than to debt when evaluating the economic characteristics
and risks of the entire Series B Preferred Stock, including the
embedded features. The Company then evaluated the embedded features
to determine whether their economic characteristics and risks were
clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the Series B Preferred Stock. Since, the Series B
Preferred Stock was determined to be more akin to equity than debt,
and the underlying that causes the value of the embedded features
to fluctuate would be the value of the Company s common
stock, the embedded features were considered clearly and closely
related to the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, the embedded
features would not need to be bifurcated from the Series B
Preferred Stock. 

Any contingent beneficial conversion features will be recognized
upon the occurrence of the contingent events based on its intrinsic
value at the commitment date. 

Accounting for the Series A Warrants 

The Company concluded the freestanding Series A Warrants were
indexed to the Company s common stock and should be
classified in stockholder s equity, based on their relative
fair value. 

Allocation of Proceeds of the Series B Private Placement on March
27 and 31, 2015 

The $2,130,750 proceeds from the Series B Private Placement on
March 27 and 31, 2015 were allocated to the Series B Preferred
Stock and Series A Warrant instruments based on their relative fair
values. 

The Series B Preferred Stock was valued on an as-if-converted basis
based on the underlying common stock.  The Series A
Warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes model with the
following weighted-average input at the time of issuance: expected
term of 5.0 years based on their contractual life, volatility of
125% based on the Company s historical volatility and risk
free rate of 1.4% based on the rate of the 5-years U.S. treasury
bill. 

After allocation of the proceeds, the effective conversion price of
the Series B Preferred Stock was determined to be beneficial and,
as a result, the Company recorded a non-cash deemed dividend of
$1,067,491 equal to the intrinsic value of the beneficial
conversion feature since the Series B Preferred Stock was
immediately convertible. 

Deemed Dividend due to Conversion Price Adjustment 

During the six months ended August 31, 2016, as a result of the
adjustment of the Series B Conversion Price from $8.25 to $2.00 per
share due to the 2016 Unit Private Placement, the Company recorded
a non-cash deemed dividend, amounting to $708,303 (the
 Deemed Dividend due to Conversion Price
Adjustment ).  The expense was measured at the
intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature for each
issuance of Series B Preferred Stock in the Series B Private
Placement and was limited to the amount of Series B Preferred
Stock allocated proceeds less previously recognized beneficial
conversion features.

The Series B Registration Rights Agreement 

In connection with the closing of the Series B Private Placement,
the Company entered into an amended and restated registration
rights agreement (the  A R Series B Registration Rights
Agreement ) with the Series B Investors, in which the Company
agreed to file a registration statement (the  Registration
Statement ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") to register for resale the shares of common stock
underlying the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series A Warrants and
the Series B Warrants within 30 calendar days of the final closing
date of March 31, 2015 (the  Filing Date ), and to have
the registration statement declared effective within 120 calendar
days of the Filing Date. 

If the Registration Statement has not been filed with the SEC on or
before the Filing Date, the Company shall, on the business day
immediately following the Filing Date, and each 15th day
thereafter, make a payment to the Series B Investors as partial
liquidated damages for such delay (together, the  Late
Registration Payments ) equal to 2.0% of the purchase price
paid for the Series B Preferred Stock then owned by the Series B
Investors for the initial 15 day period and 1.0% of the purchase
price for each subsequent 15 day period until the Registration
Statement is filed with the SEC.  Late Registration
Payments will be prorated on a daily basis during each 15-day
period and will be paid to the Series B Investors by wire transfer
or check within five business days after the end of each 15-day
period following the Filing Date. 

The Company filed the Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the
SEC on April 10, 2015, and as a result no penalty was
incurred.

NOTE 6   NOTES PAYABLE 

Promissory Note and Promissory Note Amendment 

The Company entered into a note purchase agreement effective July
31, 2015 (the  Note Purchase Agreement ) with one its
existing institutional investors (the  Note
Holder ).  Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement,
the Company issued and sold a non-convertible promissory note in
the principal amount of $1.2 million (the  Promissory
Note ) and a warrant (the  Note Warrant ) to
purchase 43,636 shares of the Company s common stock in a
private placement (the  Note Private
Placement ). 

The Promissory Note matured on July 31, 2016, accrued interest at a
rate of eight percent (8%) per annum and may be prepaid by the
Company at any time prior to the maturity date without penalty or
premium.  The Note Holder has the right at its option to
exchange (the  Note Voluntary Exchange ) the
outstanding principal balance of the Promissory Note plus the
Conversion Interest Amount (as defined below) into such number of
securities to be issued in a Public Offering (as defined
below). Upon effectuating such Note Voluntary Exchange, the
Note Holder shall be deemed to be a purchaser in the Public
Offering.  Public Offering  means a registered
offering of equity or equity-linked securities resulting in gross
proceeds of at least $5.0 million to the Company; and
 Conversion Interest Amount  means interest payable in
an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid interest assuming the
Promissory Note had been held from the issuance date to the
maturity date.  In the event the Company completes a
Public Offering and the Note Holder elected not to effectuate the
Note Voluntary Exchange, then the Company shall promptly repay the
outstanding principal amount of the Promissory Note plus all
accrued and unpaid interest following completion of the Public
Offering. 

The Note Warrant contains an adjustment clause affecting its
exercise price, which may be reduced if the Company issues shares
of common stock or convertible securities at a price below the
then-current exercise price of the Note Warrant. As a result, we
determined that the Note Warrant was not indexed to the
Company s common stock and therefore should be recorded as a
derivative liability. The detachable Note Warrant issued in
connection with the Promissory Note was recorded as a debt discount
based on its fair value (see Note 7 for fair value measurement).
The adjustment clause lapses upon listing of the Company s
common stock on a national stock exchange such as the NASDAQ, New
York Stock Exchange or NYSE MKT. 

The Company evaluated the Note Voluntary Exchange provision, which
provides for settlement of the Promissory Note at an 8% premium to
the Promissory Note s stated principal amount, in accordance
with ASC 815-15-25. The Voluntary Exchange provision is a
contingent put that is not clearly and closely related to the debt
host instrument and therefore was initially bifurcated and measured
at fair value and recorded as a derivative liability in the
consolidated balance sheet.  The derivative liability
will be measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, with changes in
fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The proceeds
of the Note Private Placement were first allocated to the fair
value of the Note Warrant in the amount of $150,544 and to the fair
value of the Note Voluntary Exchange provision in the amount of
$227,740, with the difference of $821,716 representing the initial
carrying value of the Promissory Note. Further, approximately
$105,000 of debt issuance cost was recorded as additional debt
discount at issuance.   

On February 12, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment (the
 Note Amendment ) with the Note Holder, whereby the
Company and the Note Holder agreed to extend the maturity date of
the Promissory Note from July 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and
increase the interest rate commencing August 1, 2016 to 12% per
annum. The Company also obtained the Note Holder s consent to
the consummation of the OID Note Private Placement (as defined
below), as required under the Promissory Note. 

Additionally, pursuant to the Note Amendment, the Note Voluntary
Exchange was modified to effect a voluntary exchange of $600,000
principal amount ( Initial Exchange Principal Amount )
of the Promissory Note plus the Initial Conversion Interest Amount
into a Qualified Offering (as defined below) or Public Offering.
 Initial Conversion Interest Amount  shall mean
interest payable in an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid
interest assuming the Initial Exchange Principal Amount has been
held from the issuance date to the original maturity date of July
31, 2016 (for the avoidance of doubt, such amount that is
calculated using the following formula: (a) 8% multiplied by the
Initial Exchange Principal Amount ($600,000), multiplied by (b) the
actual number of days elapsed in a year of three hundred and
sixty-five (365) days, which amount shall equal $48,000 in the
aggregate).  Qualified Offering  means one or a series
of offerings of equity or equity-linked securities resulting in
aggregate gross proceeds of at least $2,000,000 to the
Company.

Further, under the modified Note Voluntary Exchange, the Note
Holder shall have the right to effect a voluntary exchange with
respect to the remaining $600,000 principal amount (the
 Remaining Principal Amount ) plus the Remaining
Conversion Interest Amount into a Qualified Offering or Public
Offering.  Remaining Conversion Interest Amount  shall
mean interest payable in an amount equal to the sum of (A) all
accrued but unpaid interest on such portion of the Remaining
Principal Amount subject to such Voluntary Exchange assuming such
portion of the Remaining Principal Amount had been held from the
original maturity date of July 31, 2016 to the amended maturity
date of December 31, 2016 (for the avoidance of doubt, such amount
that is calculated using the following formula: (a) 12% multiplied
by such portion of the Remaining Principal Amount subject to such
Voluntary Exchange, multiplied by (b) the actual number of days
elapsed in a year of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days, which
amount shall equal $30,000 in the aggregate assuming the aggregate
Remaining Principal Amount of $600,000 is used in such
calculation), plus (B) all accrued but unpaid interest assuming
such portion of the Remaining Principal Amount had been held from
the issuance date to the original maturity date of July 31, 2016
(for the avoidance of doubt, such amount that is calculated using
the following formula: (a) 8% multiplied by such portion of the
Remaining Principal Amount, multiplied by (b) the actual number of
days elapsed in a year of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days,
which amount shall equal $48,000 in the aggregate assuming the
aggregate Remaining Principal Amount of $600,000 is used in such
calculation). 

In consideration for entering into the Note Amendment, the Company
issued the Note Holder a warrant to purchase 43,636 shares of the
Company s common stock (the  Amendment Warrant )
in substantially the same form as the Note Warrant issued in the
Note Private Placement, provided, however, that with respect to the
 full-ratchet  anti-dilution price protection
adjustments for future issuances of other Company equity or
equity-linked securities (subject to certain standard carve-outs),
such price protection adjustment shall be equal to 110% of the
consideration price per share of the issued equity or equity-linked
securities. 

The Company evaluated the Note Amendment transaction in accordance
with ASC 470-50-40-12 and determined the Note Amendment did not
constitute a substantive modification of the Promissory Note and
that the transaction should be accounted for as a debt
modification. 

The Company evaluated the Note Voluntary Exchange provision, which
provides for settlement of the Promissory Note at an 8% premium to
the Promissory Note s stated principal amount, in accordance
with ASC 815-15-25. The Note Voluntary Exchange provision is a
contingent put that is not clearly and closely related to the debt
host instrument and therefore was initially separately measured at
fair value and will be measured at fair value on an ongoing basis,
with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of
operations. 

The Amendment Warrant contains an adjustment clause affecting its
exercise price, which may be reduced if the Company issues shares
of common stock or convertible securities at a price below the
then-current exercise price of the Amendment Warrant. As a result,
the Company determined that the Amendment Warrant was not indexed
to the Company s common stock and therefore should be
recorded as a derivative liability. The fair value of the
detachable Amendment Warrant issued in connection with the Note
Amendment was recorded as a debt discount. The adjustment clause
lapses upon the Company completing a Qualified
Offering. 

Accordingly, the Company recorded a debt discount related to the
warrant liability of approximately $85,000 and a debt discount
related to the Voluntary Exchange of approximately
$104,000. 

During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $153,174 of interest expense related to the Promissory
Note, as amended, including amortization of debt discount of
$125,174 and accrued interest expense of $28,000. Additionally, the
Company recognized a gain of $294,114 in the three months ended
August 31, 2016 due to the change in estimated fair value of the
Voluntary Exchange provision. 

During the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company recognized
$291,177 of interest expense related to the Promissory Note, as
amended, including amortization of debt discount of $239,177 and
accrued interest expense of $52,000. Additionally, the Company
recognized a gain of $265,438 in the six months ended August 31,
2016 due to the change in estimated fair value of the Voluntary
Exchange provision.

OID Notes 

In February 2016, the Company entered into an OID note purchase
agreement dated February 12, 2016 (the  February 2016 OID
Note Purchase Agreement ) in a private placement (the
 OID Note Private Placement ) with various
accredited investors (the  OID Note Holders ). Pursuant
to the OID Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may issue and sell
non-convertible OID promissory notes (the  OID Notes )
up to an aggregate purchase price of $1,000,000 (the
 Purchase Price ) and warrants (the  OID
Warrants ) to purchase 7,273 shares of the Company s
common stock for every $100,000 of Purchase Price. The OID Notes
shall have an initial principal balance equal to 120% of the
Purchase Price (the  OID Principal
Amount ). Pursuant to the February 2016 OID Note
Purchase Agreement, the Company received an aggregate Purchase
Price of $500,000 and issued OID Notes in the aggregate OID
Principal Amount of $600,000 and OID Warrants to purchase an
aggregate of 36,367 shares of the Company s common
stock. 

During the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company entered
into OID note purchase agreements between March 4 and 15, 2016 (the
 March 2016 OID Note Purchase Agreements ) with various
accredited investors. Pursuant to the March 2016 OID Note Purchase
Agreements, the Company issued OID Notes with an aggregate Purchase
Price of $125,000 and OID Warrants to purchase 9,902 shares of the
Company s common stock. The OID Notes issued in March 2016
have an OID Principal Amount equal to $150,000 or 120% of the
Purchase Price. 

The OID Notes mature six (6) months following the issuance date of
each OID Note and may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior
to the maturity date without penalty or premium. In the event the
OID Notes are prepaid in full on or before the date that is ninety
(90) days following the issuance date of each OID Note, the
prepayment amount shall be equal to 110% of the Purchase Price and
in the event the OID Notes are prepaid following such initial
ninety (90) day period, the prepayment amount shall be equal to the
OID Principal Balance (the  Optional Redemption ). The
Company determined the Optional Redemption feature represents a
contingent call option. The Company evaluated the Optional
Redemption provision in accordance with ASC 815-15-25. The Company
determined that the Optional Redemption feature is clearly and
closely related to the debt host instrument and is not an embedded
derivative requiring bifurcation. 

Each OID Note Holder has the right at its option to act as a
purchaser in a Qualified Offering and, in lieu of investing new
cash subscriptions, mechanically effect a voluntary exchange (the
 OID Note Voluntary Exchange ) of the OID Principal
Amount of the OID Notes into such number of securities to be issued
in a Qualified Offering. Upon effectuating such OID Voluntary
Exchange, the OID Note Holders shall be deemed to be purchasers in
the Qualified Offering. The Company evaluated the OID Note
Voluntary Exchange provision, which provides for settlement of the
OID Notes at the OID Principal Amount in accordance with ASC
815-15-25. The Company determined the OID Note Voluntary Exchange
provision is a contingent put that is not clearly and closely
related to the debt host instrument and therefore was initially
separately measured at fair value and will be measured at fair
value on an ongoing basis, with changes in fair value recognized in
the statement of operations. 

The OID Warrants contain an adjustment clause affecting their
exercise price, which may be reduced if the Company issues shares
of common stock or convertible securities at a price below the
then-current exercise price of the OID Warrants. As a result, we
determined that the OID Warrants were not indexed to the
Company s common stock and therefore should be recorded as a
derivative liability. The detachable OID Warrants issued in
connection with the OID Notes were recorded as a debt discount
based on their fair value (see Note 7 for fair value measurement).
The adjustment clause lapses upon the Company completing the
Qualified Offering. 

Pursuant to the March 2016 closings of the OID Note Private
Placement, the OID Principal Amount was first allocated to the fair
value of the OID Warrants in the amount of $15,225, next to the
value of the original issuance discount in the amount of $25,000,
then to the fair value of the OID Note Voluntary Exchange provision
in the amount of $32,497, and lastly to the debt discount related
to offering costs of $2,210 with the difference of $75,069
representing the initial carrying value of the OID Notes issued in
March 2016.

Between August 12, 2016 and August 19, 2016, the Company entered
into certain amendments (the  OID Note
Amendments ), to its outstanding non-convertible OID
Notes originally issued between February 12, 2016 and March 15,
2016 (the  OID Notes ), with the holders of an
aggregate of $750,000 principal amount of OID Notes, whereby the
holders of the OID Notes extended the maturity date of the OID
Notes an additional three (3) months to between November 12, 2016
and December 15, 2016. In consideration for entering into the Note
Amendments, the Company (i) increased the principal amount of the
OID Notes by 10% to $825,000 in the aggregate from $750,000 in the
aggregate, (ii) issued an aggregate of 45,459 common stock purchase
warrants with an exercise price of $2.00 per share and a term of
five years, and (iii) modified the voluntary exchange provision of
the OID Notes by reducing the  Qualified Offering 
threshold amount to $500,000 from $2,000,000. Additionally, the
Company will have the sole option to extend the maturity date of
the OID Notes an additional three (3) months in consideration for a
further 10% increase in the principal amount from $825,000 to
$907,500. 

The Company evaluated the OID Note Amendments transactions in
accordance with ASC 470-50-40-12 and determined the OID Note
Amendments did not constitute a substantive modification of the OID
Notes and that the transaction should be accounted for as a debt
modification. 

During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $ 248,113  of interest
expense related to the OID Notes, as amended, including
amortization of debt discount. Additionally, the Company recognized
a gain of $216,753 in the three months ended August 31, 2016 due to
the change in estimated fair value of the OID Note Voluntary
Exchange provision.  

During the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company recognized
$ 413,703  of interest expense
related to the OID Notes, as amended, including amortization of
debt discount. Additionally, the Company recognized a gain of
$191,430 in the six months ended August 31, 2016 due to the change
in estimated fair value of the OID Note Voluntary Exchange
provision.  

The following table summarizes the notes payable: 

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, financial
instruments were measured at fair value using a three-level
hierarchy which maximizes use of observable inputs and minimizes
use of unobservable inputs: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets
for identical instruments 

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments that are directly or
indirectly observable in the market 

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs supported by little or no
market activity.  Financial instruments whose values are
determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques, for which determination of
fair value requires significant judgment or
estimation. 

Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified in
their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. At August 31, 2016 and
February 29, 2016, the warrant liability and put exchange feature
liability balances were classified as Level 3
instruments.

Derivative Warrant Liability 

The following table sets forth the changes in the estimated fair
value for our Level 3 classified derivative warrant
liability: 

The Series B Warrants contain an adjustment clause affecting the
exercise price of the Series B warrants, which may be reduced if
the Company issues shares of common stock or convertible securities
at a price below the then-current exercise price of the Series B
warrants. As a result, we determined that the Series B warrants
were not indexed to the Company s common stock and therefore
should be recorded as a derivative liability. The Series B Warrants
were measured at fair value on the issuance date using a Monte
Carlo simulation and will be re-measured to fair value at each
balance sheet date, and any resultant changes in fair value will be
recorded in earnings. The Monte Carlo simulation as of August 31,
2016 and February 29, 2016 used the following assumptions: (1) a
stock price of $1.40 and $1.80, respectively; (2) a risk free rate
of 0.99% and 1.08%, respectively; (3) an expected volatility of
134% and 134%, respectively; and (4) a fundraising event to
occur on October 31, 2016 and May 15, 2016, respectively, that
would result in the issuance of additional common
stock. 

In connection with the issuance of the Promissory Note on July 31,
2015, the Company issued a warrant to purchase an aggregate of
43,636 shares of common stock.  The warrant was issued on
July 31, 2015, was originally exercisable at $8.25 per share and
expires on July 31, 2020. The warrant contains a full-ratchet
anti-dilution price protection provision that requires liability
treatment and the exercise price of this warrant was adjusted to
$2.00 during the six months ended August 31, 2016. The fair value
of the warrant at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 was
determined to be $50,228 and $64,438, respectively, as calculated
using the Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation as of
August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 used the following
assumptions: (1) stock price of $1.40 and $1.80, respectively; (2)
a risk free rate of 1.04% and 1.13%, respectively; (3) an expected
volatility of 134% and 134%, respectively; and (4) a fundraising
event to occur on October 31, 2016 and May 15, 2016, respectively,
that would result in the issuance of additional common
stock. 

In connection with the execution of the Note Amendment on
February 12, 2016, the Company issued a warrant to purchase an
aggregate of 43,636 shares of common stock. The warrant was
issued on February 12, 2016, initially exercisable at $8.25 per
share and expires on February 11, 2021. The warrant contains a
full-ratchet anti-dilution price protection provision that requires
liability treatment and the exercise price of this warrant was
adjusted to $2.20 during the six months ended August 31, 2016. The
fair value of the warrant at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016
was determined to be $50,877 and $68,292, respectively, as
calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo
simulation as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016 used the
following assumptions: (1) stock price of $1.40 and $1.80,
respectively; (2) a risk free rate of 1.12% and 1.20%,
respectively; (3) an expected volatility of 134% and 134%,
respectively; and (4) a fundraising event to occur on October 31,
2016 and May 15, 2016, respectively, that would result in the
issuance of additional common stock.

February 29, 2016 was determined to be $42,316 and $55,621,
respectively, as calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation. The
Monte Carlo simulation as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016
used the following weighted-average assumptions: (1) stock price of
$1.40 and $1.80, respectively; (2) a risk free rate of 1.12% and
1.21%, respectively; (3) an expected volatility of 134% and 134%,

adjusted to $2.00 during the six months ended August 31, 2016. The
fair value of these warrants at August 31, 2016 and at issuance
between March 4 and 15, 2016 was determined to be $10,281 and
$15,225, respectively, as calculated using the Monte Carlo
simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation as of August 31, 2016, and
between March 4 and 15, 2016, used the following weighted-average
assumptions: (1) stock price of $1.40 and $1.97, respectively; (2)
a risk free rate of 1.12% and 1.41%, respectively; (3) an expected
volatility of 134% and 136%, respectively; and (4) a fundraising
event to occur on October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, respectively,
that would result in the issuance of additional common
stock. 

In connection with the Additional Unit Private Placement, the
Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 21,875 shares
of common stock.  These warrants were issued on August
31, 2016, are exercisable at $3.00 per share and expire on August
30, 2021. As described in Note 3, the Price Protection provision
associated with these warrants requires liability treatment. The
fair value of these warrants at August 31, 2016 was determined to
be $38,834 as calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation. The
Monte Carlo simulation as of August 31, 2016 used the following
weighted-average assumptions: (1) stock price of $1.40; (2) a risk
free rate of 1.22%; (3) an expected volatility of 134%; and (4) a
fundraising event to occur on January 31, 2017, that would result
in the issuance of additional common stock. 

Put Exchange Feature Liability 

The following table sets forth the changes in the estimated fair
value for our Level 3 classified put exchange feature
liabilities: 

The Promissory Note issued on July 31, 2015, as amended on February
12, 2016, contains a Note Voluntary Exchange provision that is a
contingent put that requires liability treatment (see Note 6). The
fair value of this put exchange feature at February 29, 2016 and
August 31, 2016 was determined to be $339,979 and $74,541,
respectively. The fair value was calculated using a probability
weighted present value methodology. The significant inputs to the
fair value model were 1) the timing of a Qualified Offering
expected to occur in May 2016 at February 29, 2016 and October 31,
2016 at August 31, 2016; 2) the combined probability of both a
Qualified Offering and a voluntary exchange to occur, which was
determined to be 71% at both February 29 and August 31, 2016 and 3)
a discount rate of 18%, approximating high yield distressed debt
rates, used for all measurement dates.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS 

Lease Agreements 

On August 28, 2014, we entered into a lease agreement (the
 Boston Lease ) for our diagnostic laboratory and
office space located in Boston, MA. The term of the Boston
Lease is for two years, from September 1, 2014 through August 31,
2016, and the basic rent payable thereunder is $10,280 per month
for the first year and $10,588 per month for the second year.
Additional monthly payments under the Boston Lease shall include
tax payments and operational and service costs. Additionally, we
paid a $40,000 security deposit in connection with entering into
the Boston Lease. Effective April 6, 2016, we entered into an
amendment to the Boston Lease (the  Boston Lease
Amendment ) whereby we extended the term by one year from
September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017. The basic rent payable under

NOTE 10   LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH ASET THERAPEUTICS,
LLC 

Effective August 31, 2016, the Company and ASET Therapeutics, LLC
( ASET ) entered into a mutual release of claims with
respect to the termination of the Memorandum of Understanding dated
July 14, 2014, as amended, the License and Development and
Commercialization Agreement dated November 25, 2014 and all other
related documents and agreements. 

The Company assessed the collectability of its notes receivable in
connection with two past due promissory notes of ASET in the
aggregate principal amount of $125,000 held by the Company (the
 ASET Notes ). The Company determined that the
probability of repayment of the ASET Notes had decreased
significantly and were to be written off. On August 30, 2016, the
Company entered into a sale and assignment agreement with a
non-affiliated shareholder, whereby the Company sold the ASET Notes
for gross proceeds of $12,500. The Company recorded a loss on sale
of notes receivable of $112,500 for the three and six months ended
August 31, 2016. 

NOTE 11   NET LOSS PER SHARE 

Basic net loss per common share is computed based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the
period.  Restricted shares issued with vesting condition
that have not been met at the end of the period are excluded from
the computation of the weighted average shares. As of August 31,
2016 and 2015, 10,417 and 31,188 restricted shares of common stock,
respectively, were excluded from the computation of the weighted
average shares. 

Diluted net loss per common share is calculated giving effect to
all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during
the period. Diluted potential common shares generally consist of
incremental shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and
warrants, shares issuable from convertible securities, and unvested
restricted shares. When dilutive, warrants classified as
liabilities are included in the potential common shares and any
change in fair value of the warrant for the period presented is
excluded from the net loss. For the periods ended August 31, 2016
and 2015, the liability warrants were not dilutive. 

In computing diluted loss per share for the periods ended August
31, 2016 and 2015, no effect has been given to the common shares
issuable at the end of the period upon the conversion or exercise
of the following securities as their inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive:

NOTE 12   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Additional Closings of the Additional Unit Private
Placement 

Subsequent to August 31, 2016, the Company completed additional
closings of the Additional Unit Private Placement (as defined in
Note 3), whereby the Company issued an aggregate of 135 
 units for 192,000   shares of common stock, 48,300 shares of its newly
created Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series
A-2 Preferred ), convertible into 483,000 shares of common
stock, and five-year common stock purchase warrants to purchase
337,500   shares of common stock
with an exercise price of $3.00 per share for aggregate gross
proceeds of $1.35 million   and
net proceeds of approximately $1.23 million. The Company may
issue shares of Series A-2 Preferred in lieu of issuing shares of
common stock in the Additional Unit Private Placement for the
benefit of certain purchasers that would be deemed to have
beneficial ownership in excess of 4.99% or 9.99%. Additionally, the
Company will issue an aggregate of 54,000 placement agent warrants
in substantially the same form as the warrants issued to the
investors in the Additional Unit Private
Placement.  

Research Collaboration 

On September 29, 2016, the Company and Celgene Corporation
( Celgene ) entered into an amendment (the
   Amendment   ) to a previously executed pilot materials
transfer agreement (the  Research Agreement ), to
conduct a mutually agreed upon pilot research project (the
 Pilot Project ). The Amendment provides for milestone
payments to the Company of up to $973,482. Under the terms of the
Research Agreement, Celgene will provide certain proprietary
materials to the Company and the Company will evaluate
Celgene s proprietary materials in the Company s
metastatic cell line and animal nonclinical models. The milestone
schedule calls for Celgene to pay the Company $486,741 upon
execution of the Amendment, which the Company has received, and the
balance in accordance with the completion of three (3) milestones
to Celgene s reasonable satisfaction. The term of the
Research Agreement is one (1) year, unless extended by the parties.
Either party may terminate the Research Agreement with thirty (30)
days prior written notice.

financial statements and the related notes thereto and other
financial information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended February 29, 2016. 

Business Overview 

We are a pre-commercial biotechnology company focused on the
development and commercialization of diagnostic tests that are
prognostic for risk of cancer metastasis, companion diagnostics to
predict drug response, and anti-metastatic drugs. Our driver-based
platform technology is based on the pivotal role of the Mena
protein and its isoforms, a common pathway for the development of
metastatic disease in epithelial-based solid tumors. 

Our product development strategy is based on identifying patients
most at risk for cancer metastasis and targeting the underlying
mechanisms that drive the metastatic cascade. Unlike most oncology
therapeutics that kill cancer cells directly or inhibit cancer cell
proliferation, we focus on preventing aggressive tumors from
spreading. This is particularly relevant as most cancer deaths are
caused by aggressive tumors that spread throughout the body and not
due to growth of the primary tumor. 

Our novel diagnostic tests provide oncologists with
clinically-actionable information to optimize cancer treatment
strategies based on the specific biological nature of each
patient s tumor. We believe cancer treatment strategies can
be personalized, outcomes improved and costs reduced through new
diagnostic tools that identify the aggressiveness of primary
tumors, predict benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, and response to
existing therapeutics including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
and taxane-based drugs. The MetaSite   Breast    and MenaCalc  assays are designed to
accurately stratify patients based on the aggressiveness of their
tumor and risk the cancer will spread. During 2016 and 2017, we
plan to complete additional breast cancer clinical studies with the
aim of providing additional prognostic and chemo-predictive
clinical evidence and to further define specificity, sensitivity
and clinical utility of our tests. Our diagnostic assays will be
offered as Laboratory Developed Tests (LDT) through our
state-of-the-art CLIA-certified central reference laboratory
located in Boston, MA.  

Going Concern 

Since our inception, we have generated significant net losses. As
of August 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$25.5 million. At August 31, 2016 we have a negative working
capital. We incurred net losses of approximately $2.1 million and
$2.3 million for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. We expect our net losses to continue for at
least the next several years. We anticipate that a substantial
portion of our capital resources and efforts will be focused on
research and development, both to develop additional tests for
breast cancer and to develop products for other cancers, to scale
up our commercial organization, and other general corporate
purposes. Our financial results will be limited by a number of
factors, including establishment of coverage policies by
third-party insurers and government payers, and our ability in the
short term to collect from payers often requiring a case-by-case
manual appeals process. Until we receive routine reimbursement
and are able to record revenues as tests are processed and reports
delivered, we are likely to continue reporting net
losses. 

Subsequent to August 31, 2016, we
completed additional closings of the Additional Unit Private
Placement for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.35 million 
 and net proceeds of approximately
$1.23 million.

Table of Contents  

We currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and the
proceeds from our Additional Unit Private Placement will be
sufficient to fund our operations through February 28, 2017, 
 without raising additional capital.
Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued
financial support from our shareholders, our ability to obtain
necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations, and
the attainment of profitable operations. These factors raise
substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern. We cannot make any assurances that additional financings
will be available to us and, if available, completed on a timely
basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to complete
a debt or equity offering, or otherwise obtain sufficient financing
when and if needed, it would negatively impact our business and
operations and could also lead to the reduction or suspension of
our operations and ultimately force us to cease our
operations.  

ASET License Agreement 

On November 25, 2014, we entered into the ASET License Agreement
with ASET, a private third party entity affiliated with one of the
Company s directors.  The ASET License Agreement
sets forth the rights and obligations of the parties with respect
to the grant by the Company to ASET of an exclusive license of
certain of the Company s therapeutic assets and an exclusive
sublicense, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, of
all rights and obligations under the Company s existing
Alternative Splicing Therapeutic License Agreement dated as of as
of December 7, 2013. The licensed technology includes: (i)
Alternative Splicing Event (ASE) technology based on International
Patent Application WO 2012/116248 A1 entitled "Alternatively
Spliced mRNA Isoforms as Prognostic and Therapeutic Tools for
Metastatic Breast Cancer and Other Invasive/Metastatic Cancers";
and (ii) Technology and know-how stemming from all ASE discovery
work carried out in our labs at SUNY Stony Brook from September
2013 through November 25, 2014. The ASET License
Agreement provides that the Company has the right to commercialize
any Companion Diagnostics arising from the work performed by ASET
under the ASET License Agreement, pursuant to an exclusive
sublicense.   

The ASET License Agreement calls for certain customary payments,
such as annual license maintenance payments ranging from $5,000 to
$25,000, and milestone payments upon the achievement of specified
regulatory and sales milestones.  The ASET License
Agreement also requires the payment by ASET of a low single-digit
royalty on net sales, at such time, if ever, as ASET s
products are fully developed, receive the required regulatory
approvals and are commercialized. 

We determined that ASET met the criteria for variable interest
entities ( VIEs ) because it lacked substantial equity
investment. VIEs are consolidated by the primary
beneficiary. 

The primary beneficiary is the party who has both the power to
direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most
significantly impact the entity s economic performance and an
obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive
benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to
the entity. We determined that the Company was not the primary
beneficiary of ASET based primarily on the facts that we did not
have the power to direct ASET s operations nor did we have
any obligation to absorb ASET losses.  As a result, ASET
had not been consolidated by the Company based on our determination
that the Company was not the primary beneficiary. 

Our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of the
VIE is based upon the facts and circumstances for the VIE and
requires significant judgment regarding whether we have power to
direct the VIE s most significant activities, which includes,
but is not limited to, the VIE s purpose and design and the
risks passed through to investors, the voting interests of the VIE,
management, service and/or other agreements of the VIE, involvement
in the VIE s initial design and the existence of explicit or
implicit financial guarantees. 

On December 31, 2015, the ASET License Agreement was terminated due
to ASET s failure to meet certain obligations due to us. All
intellectual property licensed to ASET pursuant to the ASET License
Agreement has been returned to the Company and the parties entered
into a mutual release effective August 30,
2016.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles. The
preparation of these financial statements requires management to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as
well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We
evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore
differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. 

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to
our consolidated financial statements included in the Form
10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016.  We believe
the following critical accounting policies reflect our more
significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of
our financial statements. 

Stock-based Compensation 

We account for share-based payment awards issued to employees and
members of our Board by measuring the fair value of the award on
the date of grant and recognizing this fair value as stock-based
compensation using a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, generally the vesting period.  For awards issued
to non-employees, the measurement date is the date when the
performance is complete or when the award vests, whichever is the
earliest. Accordingly, non-employee awards are remeasured at each
reporting period until the final measurement date. The fair value
of the award is recognized as stock-based compensation over the
requisite service period, generally the vesting
period. 

Debt and Equity Instruments 

We analyze debt and equity issuance for various features that
would generally require either bifurcation and derivative
accounting, or recognition of a debt discount or premium under
authoritative guidance. 

Detachable warrants issued in conjunction with debt are measured at
their relative fair value, if they are determined to be equity
instrument, or their fair value, if they are determined to be
liability instruments, and recorded as a debt
discount. 

Conversion features that are in the money at the commitment date
constitute a beneficial conversion feature that is measured at its
intrinsic value and recognized as debt discount or deemed dividend.
Debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the maturity
period of the debt using the effective interest
method. 

Any contingent beneficial conversion feature would be recognized
when and if the contingent event occurs based on its intrinsic
value at the commitment date. 

Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value 

We account for certain warrants and exchange features embedded in
notes payable that are not deemed to be indexed to the
Company s own stock in accordance with the guidance contained
in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ) and ASC Topic 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity ( ASC 480 ).
Such instruments are classified as liabilities and measured at
their fair values at the time of issuance and at each reporting
period, which change in fair value being recognized in the
statement of operations. The fair values of these instruments have
been estimated using Monte Carlo simulations and other valuation
techniques.

Financial Operations Overview 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of
personnel related costs, legal costs, including intellectual
property, accounting costs and other professional and
administrative costs. 

Research and Development Expenses 

The majority of the research and development expenses were focused
on the research and development of the MetaSite   Breast  
 and the MenaCalc      platform. In 2014, initial research on our
therapeutic platform was sublicensed to ASET pursuant to the ASET
License Agreement. On December 31, 2015, the ASET License Agreement
terminated and rights to the therapeutic platform reverted back to
us.  

We charge all research and development expenses to operations as
they are incurred. All potential future product programs, apart
from our breast cancer diagnostic are in the clinical research and
development phase, and the earliest we expect another cancer
indication to reach the commercialization stage is
2018. 

We do not record or maintain information regarding costs incurred
in research and development on a program or project specific
basis. Our research and development staff working under
sponsored research agreements and consulting agreements and
associated infrastructure resources are deployed across several
programs. Additionally, many of our costs are not attributable
to individual programs. Therefore, we believe that allocating
costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not
accurately reflect the actual costs of a project. 

As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to
determine the duration and completion costs of our research and
development programs or when, if ever, and to what extent we will
receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a
product. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the
Three Months Ended      
August   31, 2016 and 
 August 
 31,
2015   

Revenues  .  There were
no revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, because we have not yet commercialized any of our
function-based diagnostic tests.  

General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expense was $615,849
for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to
$1,076,032 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. This
represents an aggregate decrease of $460,183. Stock-based
compensation was $200,094 for the three months ended August 31,
2016 as compared to approximately $261,017 for the three months
ended August 31, 2015. Excluding non-cash stock-based
compensation expense and depreciation expense, general and
administrative expenses decreased by $399,155 to $412,176 for the
three months ended August 31, 2016 from $811,331 for the three
months ended August 31, 2015.   

Consulting expense, investor relations and corporate communications
expense, corporate legal expense, travel expense, and board
compensation, all decreased by $257,202, $64,715, $30,229, $18,825
and $12,500, respectively. Decreased general and administrative
expenses were partially offset by increased intellectual property
legal expense and D O insurance expense of approximately
$30,521 and $12,415, respectively. We expect general and
administrative expenses to remain relatively stable for the
remainder of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2017, as projected
increases in payroll and related expenses and consulting expenses
will be offset by reduced offering and one-time costs. 

Research and Development Expenses.   Research and development expenses increased by
$38,200 to $356,168 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 from
$317,968 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. Excluding
non-cash stock-based compensation expense
and depreciation expense, research and development expenses
increased by $19,227 to $292,838, for the three months ended August
31, 2016 from $273,611 for the three months ended August 31,
2015.  

-28- 

Table of Contents  

Research and development consulting expense increased by $53,983,
which was partially offset by decreased laboratory consumable
expense of approximately $40,633. We expect research and
development expenses to increase for the remainder of this fiscal
year ending February 28, 2017 as we conduct addition breast cancer
clinical studies and other research and development
activities. 

Other (Income) Expense.   Other
expense amounted to income of $92,516 for the three months ended
August 31, 2016 as compared to income of approximately $132,129 for
the three months ended August 31, 2015.  This represents
a change of $39,613. This change was due in part to
an increase in interest expense on the notes payable of
$361,546, a loss from the change in fair value of the warrant
liability of $59,841, a loss on sale of notes receivable of
$112,500, offset by the change in fair value of the put liability
on the notes payable of $514,001.  

Net Loss.   As a result of
the factors described above, we had a net loss of $879,501 for the
three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to a net loss of
$1,261,871 for the three months ended August 31,
2015.  

Comparison of the
Six Months Ende     d 
 August 
 31, 2016
and   August 
 31,
2015   

Revenues  .  There were
no revenues for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, because we have not yet commercialized any of our
function-based diagnostic tests.  

General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expense was $1,171,530
for the six months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $2,024,928
for the six months ended August 31, 2015. This represents an
aggregate decrease of $853,398. Stock-based compensation was
$287,860 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to
$468,129 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. Excluding
non-cash stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense,
general and administrative expenses decreased by $673,038 to
$876,390 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 from $1,549,428
for the six months ended August 31, 2015.   

Consulting expense, investor relations and corporate communications
expense, corporate legal expense, accounting, audit and tax
expense, payroll and related expense, board compensation, and
travel expense all decreased by $311,867, $164,261, $99,053,
$84,537, $33,183, $25,000 and $18,279, respectively. Decreased
general and administrative expenses were partially offset by
increased intellectual property legal expense and D O insurance
expense of approximately $74,630 and $25,708, respectively. We
expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively
stable for the next fiscal year ending February 28, 2017, as
projected increases in payroll and related expenses and consulting
expenses will be offset by reduced one-time and uplisting-related
costs. 

Research and Development Expenses.   Research and development expenses increased by
$89,997 to $627,291 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 from
$537,294 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. Excluding
non-cash stock-based compensation expense
and depreciation expense, research and development expenses
increased by $54,849 to $526,626 for the six months ended August
31, 2016 from $471,777 for the six months ended August 31,
2015.  

Research and development consulting expense increased by $125,353,
which was partially offset by decreased laboratory consumable
expense, and payroll and related expenses of $77,690 and $29,660,
respectively. We expect research and development expenses to
increase for the remainder of this fiscal year ending February 28,
2017 as we conduct addition clinical studies and other research and
development activities. 

Other (Income) Expense.   Other
expense amounted to an expense of $300,469 for the six months ended
August 31, 2016 as compared to income of $225,444 for the six
months ended August 31, 2015.  This represents a change
of $525,913. This change was due in part to an increase in
interest expense on the notes payable of $706,636,
an increase in other income of $139,953, gain from the change
in fair value of the warrant liability of $111,151, and a loss from
the change in fair value of the put liability on the notes payable
of $460,002.  

Net Loss.   As a result of
the factors described above, we had a net loss of $2,099,290 for
the six months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to a net loss of
$2,336,778 for the six months ended August 31,
2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and, as of
August 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$25.5 million. We have not yet achieved profitability and
anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the
foreseeable future. We expect that our research and
development, general and administrative and commercialization
expenses will continue to grow and, as a result, we will need to
generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability. We
may never achieve profitability. 

Sources of Liquidity 

Since our inception, substantially all of our operations have been
financed through the sale of our common stock, preferred stock, and
promissory notes. Through August 31, 2016, we had received net
proceeds of approximately $6.7 million through the sale of common
stock to investors, approximately $0.3 million through the sale of
Series A Preferred Stock to investors, approximately $3.4 million
through the sale of Series B Preferred Stock to investors,
approximately $3.5 million from the issuance of convertible
promissory notes and approximately $1.8 million from the issuance
of non-convertible promissory notes.  As of August 31,
2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $86,233 and net debt of
approximately $2.0 million.  Through August 31, 2016, we
have issued and outstanding warrants to purchase 1,142,532 shares
of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $11.23,
which could result in proceeds to us of approximately $12.8 million
if all outstanding warrants were exercised for cash. Subsequent to
August 31, 2016, we have received net proceeds of approximately
$1.23 million through the sale of common stock, Series A-2
Preferred stock and warrants to investors in the Additional Unit
Private Placement.

At August 31, 2016, we had $86,173 in cash and cash equivalents,
compared to $1,087,982 on August 31, 2015.  

Net cash used in operating activities was $796,110 for the six
months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $1,854,459 for the six
months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease in cash used of
$1,058,349 was primarily due to reduced payroll and related
expenses, public company and professional fees associated with
offerings and non-recurring transaction costs. We expect amounts
used in operating activities to increase in fiscal year 2017 and
beyond as we grow our corporate operations. 

Net cash provided by investing activities was $12,500 for the six
months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $146,561 of cash used for
the six months ended August 31, 2015. The $159,061 of net cash used
in investing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2015
was mainly attributable to laboratory equipment purchases for our
research and development and CLIA-certified reference laboratory
facility in Boston. We expect amounts used in investing activities
to increase in fiscal year 2017 and beyond as we grow our corporate
operations, expand research and development activities and
establish and add capacity in our commercial laboratory, which is
expected to result in an increase of our capital
expenditures. 

Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months
ended August 31, 2016 was $506,060 compared to $2,831,182 for the
three months ended August 31, 2015. Financing activities
consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of non-convertible
OID promissory notes and warrants and common stock and warrants for
the six months ended August 31, 2016, and from the sale of Series B
Preferred Stock and warrants and the issuance of promissory notes
and warrants for the six months ended August 31, 2015.

Contractual Obligations 

As of August 31, 2016, we had the following contractual
commitments: 

(1) 

Amount of additional payments depends on several factors, including

issued. 

(2) 

Amount of additional payments depends on several factors, including
the duration of the Second License Agreement, which depends on
expiration of the last patent to be issued pursuant to the Second

(3) 

No annual license maintenance fee payments are due on the
Alternative Splicing Therapeutic License Agreement so as long as
the Alternative Splicing Diagnostic License Agreement is in
effect. 

(4) 

Amount of additional payments depends on several factors, including
the duration of the Alternative Splicing Diagnostic License

Pursuant to the Second License Agreement, we are required to make
annual license maintenance fee payments beginning on January 3,
2013. The license maintenance payment of $30,000 for 2016 is
currently outstanding. We are required to make additional payments
of $50,000 in 2017, $75,000 in 2018 and $100,000 in 2019 and every
year the license is in effect thereafter. These annual license
maintenance fee payments will be credited to running royalties due
on net sales earned in the same calendar year, if any. We are in
compliance with the Second License Agreement. 

We paid a license-signing fee of $15,000 in connection with
entering into the Alternative Splicing Diagnostic License Agreement
and a license-signing fee of $5,000 in connection with entering
into the Alternative Splicing Therapeutic License
Agreement.  Pursuant to these agreements, we are required
to make annual license maintenance fee payments for each license
beginning on January 1, 2015. As of August 31, 2016, the license
maintenance payment of $15,000 for 2016 was outstanding. 
Subsequent to August 31, 2016, the license maintenance payment of
$15,000 has been satisfied.  We are required to make
additional payments of $25,000 in 2017, $37,500 in 2018, and
$50,000 in 2019 and every year each license is in effect
thereafter.  On November 25, 2014, we entered into the
ASET License Agreement with ASET who will assume responsibility for
payment of half of the annual license maintenance fees as long as
the Alternative Splicing Diagnostic License Agreement remains in
effect. These annual license maintenance fee payments will be
credited to running royalties due on net sales earned in the same
calendar year, if any. No annual license maintenance fee payments
are due on the Alternative Splicing Therapeutic License Agreement
so as long as the Alternative Splicing Diagnostic License Agreement
is in effect. We are in compliance with the Alternative Splicing

license maintenance payment of $10,000 has been satified.  We
are required to make additional payments of $15,000 in 2017,
$15,000 in 2018, and $20,000 in 2019 and every year the license is
in effect thereafter. These annual license maintenance fee payments
will be credited to running royalties due on net sales earned in
the same calendar year, if any. We are in compliance with the
Antibody License Agreement. 

Lease Agreements 

On August 28, 2014, we entered into a lease agreement (the
 Boston Lease ) for our diagnostic laboratory and
office space located in Boston, MA. The term of the Boston
Lease is for two years, from September 1, 2014 through August 31,
2016, and the basic rent payable thereunder is $10,280 per month
for the first year and $10,588 per month for the second year.
Additional monthly payments under the Boston Lease shall include
tax payments and operational and service costs. Additionally, we
paid a $40,000 security deposit in connection with entering into
the Boston Lease. Effective April 6, 2016, we entered into an
amendment to the Boston Lease (the  Boston Lease
Amendment ) whereby we extended the term by one year from
September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017. The basic rent payable under
the Boston Lease Amendment increased to $17,164 per month plus
additional monthly payments, including tax payments and operational
and service costs. 

Effective March 1, 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for
short-term office space in New York, NY.  The term of the
lease is month-to-month and may be terminated upon twenty-one
days  notice. The basic rent payment is $1,400 per month and
we paid a $2,100 security deposit in connection with entering into
the lease. Effective December 1, 2015, we amended our lease
agreement for the short-term office space in New York,
NY.  The term of the lease remains month-to-month and may
still be terminated with twenty-one days  notice. The basic
rent payment increased to $2,400 per month and we paid an
additional $1,500 security deposit in connection with the amended
lease. 

We intend to enter into arrangements for the acquisition of
additional laboratory equipment, computer hardware and software,
including data storage, leasehold improvements and office equipment
in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as we prepare for
commercialization of our metastatic breast cancer
diagnostic. We cannot at this time provide assurances that we
will be able to enter into agreements with vendors on terms
commercially favorable to us or that we will be able to enter into
such arrangements without securing additional
financing.

Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements 

We currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and the
proceeds from our Additional Unit Private Placement will be
sufficient to fund our operations through February 28, 2017,
without raising additional capital. We expect to continue to incur
substantial operating losses in the future and to make capital
expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and
development programs and to scale up our commercial operations,
which we expect to fund in part with the proceeds of the recent
financing activities. It may take several years to move any
one of a number of product candidates in clinical research through
the development and validation phases to commercialization. We
expect that the remainder of the net proceeds and our existing cash
and cash equivalents will be used to fund working capital and for
capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, such as
licensing technology rights, partnering arrangements for the
processing of tests outside the United States or reduction of
contractual obligations. A portion of the net proceeds may
also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses,
technologies, services or products. We have no current plans,
agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition or
investment, and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations
with respect to any such transaction. 

The amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending upon a number of factors, such as the progress of our
product development, regulatory requirements, commercialization
efforts, the amount of cash used by operations and progress in
reimbursement. We expect that we will receive limited payments
for our breast cancer diagnostic tests, including the
MetaSite   Breast  TM 
 and MenaCalc  TM 
 Breast 
 test billings from the beginning of
our marketing efforts into the foreseeable future. As
reimbursement contracts with third-party payers are put into place,
we expect an increase in the number and level of payments received
for our breast cancer diagnostic, including the MetaSite 
 Breast  TM 
 and MenaCalc  TM 
 Breast 
 test billings.  

We cannot be certain that any of our future efforts to develop
future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise
sufficient additional funds to see these programs through to a
successful result. 

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors,
including the following: 

the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements
with third-party payers; 

the success of billing, and collecting receivables; 

the cost of expanding our commercial and laboratory operations,
including our selling and marketing efforts; 

the rate of progress and cost of research and development
activities associated with expansion of products for breast cancer;
and 

the rate of progress and cost of research and development
activities associated with products in the research phase focused
on cancer, other than breast cancer. 

Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to
finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to
finance future cash needs primarily through public or private
equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic
collaborations. The issuance of equity securities may result in
dilution to stockholders. We cannot make any assurances that
additional financings will be completed on a timely basis, on
acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to complete a debt or
equity offering, or otherwise obtain sufficient financing when and
if needed, it would negatively impact our business and operations,
which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. It
could also lead to the reduction or suspension of our operations
and ultimately force the Company to cease operations.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or
submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including principal executive and
financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to
the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and
procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can
only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control
objectives. 

Management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of the
Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance, of the
effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of August
31, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance, concluded that
the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. 

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31,
2016.  In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth by   Internal
Control Integrated Framework   (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its
assessment using those criteria, management concluded that internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31,
2016.  

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to obtain an
attestation report from our registered public accounting firm
regarding internal controls over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have had no changes in internal control over financial reporting
during the three months ended August 31, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal
control over financial reporting.

If the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, its
securities will have little or no value. 

The report of the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm that accompanies the Company's audited consolidated
financial statements for the years ended February 29, 2016 and
February 28, 2015 contains a going concern qualification in which
such firm expressed substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. As of August 31, 2016, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of approximately $25.5 million. The
Company currently anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents
will be sufficient to fund its operations through February 28,
2017  , without raising
additional capital. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon continued financial support from its
shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity
and/or debt financing to continue operations, and the attainment of
profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt
regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional
financings will be completed on a timely basis, on acceptable terms
or at all. If the Company is unable to complete a debt or equity
offering, or otherwise obtain sufficient financing when and if
needed, it would negatively impact its business and operations,
which could cause the price of its common stock to decline. It
could also lead to the reduction or suspension of the
Company s operations and ultimately force the Company to go
out of business.
