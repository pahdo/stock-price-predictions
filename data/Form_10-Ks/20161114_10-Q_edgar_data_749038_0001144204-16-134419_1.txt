1.  Overview of Business and Basis of Presentation   

References herein to  Concurrent, 
the  Company,   we,   our,  or  us  refer to Concurrent Computer Corporation and
its subsidiaries unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. 

We provide software, hardware
and professional services for the content delivery market, storage solutions market and the high-performance, real-time
market. Effective July 1, 2016, we changed the way our chief operating decision maker views our operating results by providing
more discrete segment financial information. As a result, our reportable operating segments now consist of Content Delivery
and Real-Time. 

Our content delivery solutions consist of software,
hardware and services for intelligently streaming video content to a variety of consumer devices and storing and managing content
in the network. Our streaming video and storage products and services are deployed by service providers to support consumer-facing
video services including live broadcast video, video-on-demand and time-shifted video applications such as cloud-based digital
video recording. In fiscal year 2016, we introduced Aquari , our new unified scale-out storage solutions product to our content
delivery customers. 

Our real-time solutions consist of real-time
Linux    operating system versions, development and performance optimization tools, simulation software and other
system software combined, in many cases, with computer platforms and services. These real-time products are sold to a wide variety
of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets
around the world. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a
normal recurring nature which were considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. The year-end condensed consolidated
balance sheet data as of June 30, 2016 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but do not include all disclosures
required by U.S. GAAP. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on August 30, 2016. 

There have been no changes to our Significant
Accounting Policies as disclosed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2016. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not be regarded
as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. 

Smaller Reporting Company  

We meet the SEC s definition of a  Smaller
Reporting Company,  and therefore qualify for the SEC s reduced disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2.    Recent Accounting Guidance    

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance  

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2015-05,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software
(Subtopic 350-40)  ( ASU 2015-05 ).    The pronouncement was issued to provide guidance concerning accounting
for fees in a cloud computing arrangement. The pronouncement was effective for us on July 1, 2016, and we adopted the guidance
prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), as part of its ongoing efforts to assist
in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue
recognition. Under ASU 2014-09, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In
addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) :
 Deferral of the Effective   Date  and deferred the original effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result,
ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018. Early adoption is not permitted. Additionally, in March 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
Revenue Gross versus Net ) ( ASU  2016-08 ); in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ); and in
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ), all of which provide additional clarification on certain topics addressed
in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 follow the same implementation guidelines as ASU 2014-09 and
ASU 2015-14. We anticipate that ASU 2014-09 and its related standards may have a material impact, and we are currently evaluating
the impact these standards will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
 Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), which provides guidance on determining when and how to
disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim period and
annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements
are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if  conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect ASU 2014-15 to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
 Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ). This amendment requires that
an entity measure its inventory at the  lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
Current literature requires measurement of inventory at  lower of cost or market.  Market could be replacement cost,
net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 applies to all entities and
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.
We do not expect ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize a lease liability for the obligation
to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU
2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including
income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU
2016-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We do not expect ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements or disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which eliminates the diversity in
practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying
guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively
to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case, prospective application is permitted. We do not expect ASU
2016-15 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 

3.    Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share    

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares including dilutive common share
equivalents. Under the treasury stock method, incremental shares representing the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued are included in the computation. Common share equivalents
of 342,361 and 127,190 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were excluded from the calculation
as their effect was anti-dilutive. 

The following table presents a reconciliation
of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated:

4.    Fair Value Measurements    

Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement
date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed
at fair value, we consider the most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would
use when pricing the asset or liability. 

The Accounting Standards Codification requires
certain disclosures around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the
inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair
value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: 

Level 1 
     Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

Level 2 
     Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  

Level 3 
     Assets or liabilities for which fair value is based on valuation models with significant unobservable pricing inputs and which result in the use of management estimates.  

We have money market funds that are highly liquid
and have a maturity of three months or less, and as such, are considered cash equivalents and fall within Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy. We have no financial assets that are measured on a recurring basis that fall within Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy. 

Our financial assets that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:

5.    Income Taxes    

Components of Provision (Benefit) for Income
Taxes  

The domestic and foreign components of income
(loss) before the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows: 

We recorded income tax expense for our domestic
and foreign subsidiaries of $128 and an income tax benefit of $117 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows: 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, the domestic tax expense is higher than the prior year due to the full valuation allowance that is now being applied to
any tax benefit generated from operating losses. The domestic expense is primarily attributable to interest and penalties on
uncertain tax positions and minimum state taxes in a number of jurisdictions for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
The foreign tax expense is lower than the prior year primarily due to (1) lower pretax book income in Japan and (2) a
reduction in the statutory tax rate in Japan for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period from
the prior year. 

Net Operating Losses  

As of June 30, 2016, we had U.S.
federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) of approximately $89,937 for income tax purposes, of which none
expire in fiscal year 2017, and the remainder expire at various dates through fiscal year 2035. We recently completed an
evaluation of the potential effect of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ) on our ability to
utilize these net operating losses. The study concluded that we have not had an ownership change for the period from July 22,
1993 to June 30, 2016. If we experience an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Code, our ability to use these
NOLs will be substantially limited, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset. On March 1, 2016, we
adopted a Tax Asset Preservation Plan ( TAPP ) in order to protect the value of our NOLs. At our 2016 Annual
Meeting held on October 26, 2016, our shareholders adopted a formal amendment to our certificate of incorporation with terms
substantially similar to the TAPP. The TAPP terminated in accordance with its terms on November 3, 2016 concurrent with the
effectiveness of the amendment to our certificate of incorporation. 

As of June 30, 2016, we had state NOLs of $51,346
and foreign NOLs of $28,208. The state NOLs expire between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2035. The foreign NOLs expire according
to the rules of each country. Currently, none of the jurisdictions in which the Company has foreign NOLs are subject to expiration
due to indefinite carryforward periods.

Valuation Allowance  

Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent
primarily on the generation of future taxable income. In considering the need for a valuation allowance, we consider our historical
and future projected operations along with other positive and negative evidence in assessing if sufficient future taxable income
will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. The following summarizes our conclusions on the need for a valuation
allowance in each jurisdiction as of September 30, 2016: 

U.S.    As of June 30, 2016, we
believed the weight of negative evidence was greater than the existing positive evidence and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not
that we would be unable to realize our U.S. net deferred tax assets. As a result, a full valuation allowance was established on
our U.S. net deferred tax assets which continue to remain in place as of September 30, 2016. For future periods in which we remain
in a full valuation allowance position, we would expect our U.S. tax provision expense to be limited to the alternative minimum
tax (if applicable) for federal tax purposes, which approximates 2% of earnings before income taxes, state taxes in various jurisdictions,
and interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions. 

U.K.  - During our fiscal year 2014, a
change in U.K. tax law relative to treatment of research and development expenses allowed us to release $214 of valuation allowances
against deferred tax assets that we believe are now realizable as a result of the current period tax law change. We believe that
in light of this law change, we will now generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our net deferred tax assets in the
U.K. 

Japan  - Our subsidiary in Japan has a
long history of profitable operations, and we continue to project profitability in Japan for the foreseeable future. Therefore,
we continue to believe that we will fully realize the net deferred tax assets in Japan, and no valuation allowance is needed. 

Other Foreign Jurisdictions  - We also
evaluated the need for a continued full valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets in other jurisdictions. We
concluded that a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for other foreign jurisdictions was warranted due to,
among other reasons, (i) the realized cumulative accounting losses, (ii) our long history of taxable losses and (iii) our uncertainty
with respect to generating future taxable income in the near term given our recently completed projections and other inherent uncertainties
in our business. 

We are beginning to show greater profitability
in our German operations. While we continue to have cumulative losses over a 12-quarter period, it is possible that we could become
cumulatively profitable over a 12-quarter period in the next 12 to 24 months should profitable operations continue. We will continue
to monitor results in Germany to determine if a change in our valuation allowance conclusion is needed. 

Each quarter, we assess the total weight of
positive and negative evidence and evaluate whether release of all or any portion of the valuation allowance is appropriate. Should
we come to the conclusion that a release of our valuation allowances is required, or that additional valuation allowance is required,
there could be a significant increase or decrease in net income and earnings per share in the period of release, or the additional
valuation allowance, due to the impact on the tax rate. 

Unrecognized Tax Benefits  

The Company has evaluated its unrecognized tax
benefits and determined that there has not been a material change in the amount of such benefits for the three months ended September
30, 2016.

6.    Share-Based Compensation    

As of September 30, 2016, we had share-based
compensation plans which are described in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. We recognize stock compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual
grantees, which generally equals the vesting period. As of September 30, 2016, we had 70,509 stock options outstanding and 652,125
restricted shares outstanding. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, no stock options were granted or exercised; however,
13,910 stock options were cancelled. We recorded share-based compensation related to the issuance of restricted stock to employees
and board members as follows: 

A summary of the activity of our time-based,
service condition restricted shares during the three months ended September 30, 2016, is presented below: 

In conjunction with the resignation of one of
our directors (See Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies   Board Representation and Standstill Agreement), we accelerated
the vesting of 5,400 shares of restricted stock. This acceleration of vesting resulted in stock compensation expense of $27 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, we issued 50,000 performance-based restricted shares ( PSAs ) to senior and executive management. The PSAs issued
in fiscal year 2016 will be released only if certain company financial performance criteria are achieved over a cumulative three-year
performance period. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share for these PSAs was established on the date the cumulative
three-year performance criteria was approved by our Board of Directors ( Board ).

7.    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits    

Defined Contribution Plans  

We maintain a retirement savings plan available
to U.S. employees that qualifies as a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50%
of the first 5% of the participants  compensation invested by the employee in the 401(k) plan. We made matching contributions
of $133 and $124 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We also maintain a defined contribution plan
(the  Stakeholder Plan ) for our U.K. based employees. The Stakeholder Plan provides for discretionary matching contributions
of between 4% and 7% of the employee s salary. We contributed $13 and $14 to the Stakeholder Plan for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Defined Benefit Plans  

The following table provides the components
of net periodic pension cost of our German defined benefit pension plans recognized in earnings for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015: 

We contributed $4 to our German defined benefit
pension plans for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to make additional,
similar, quarterly contributions during the remaining quarters of our fiscal year 2017.

On September 9, 2015, we sold the customer contracts
and intellectual property related to our multi-screen video analytics product line for $3,500 pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement
( APA ) dated August 31, 2015 with Verimatrix, Inc. ( Verimatrix ), a privately-held video revenue security
company based in San Diego, California. The APA included customary terms and conditions, including provisions that require the
Company to indemnify Verimatrix for certain losses that it incurs as a result of a breach by the Company of its representations
and warranties in the APA and certain other matters. Proceeds from the sale were payable to the Company as follows: (1) a $2,750
payment to the Company in cash (received on September 10, 2015) , (2) a $375 deferred payment (received in full on June
30, 2016) and (3) $375 placed in escrow (released and received in full on June 30, 2016). No amounts were held back pusuant
to indemnification provisions in the APA. 

The customer contracts and intellectual property
sold had a net book value of $188 (which was included in intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheet). As a result
of the sale, we also included $1,016 (net liability, consisting primarily of unearned deferred revenue) of related assets and liabilities
not sold or transferred in the transaction in the calculation of the recorded gain. Additionally, through September 30, 2015, we
incurred $212 in legal, accounting and other expenses that would not have been incurred otherwise. As a result, we recorded a net
gain of $4,116 in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

On July 1, 2015, we had adopted ASU No. 2014-08,
 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations
and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  ( ASU 2014-08 ). As a result, we evaluated the sale of
our multi-screen video analytics product line in light of this new standard. We concluded that the sale of our multi-screen video
analytics product line in September 2015 was not a  material shift  (as defined in ASU 2014-08) for us and therefore,
was not considered a discontinued operation. The operating profit related to the multi-screen video analytics product line for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 (through the date of sale) was $179. 

13.    Segment Information    

Reportable Operating
Segments  

The  management approach  has
been used to present the following segment information. This approach is based upon the way the management organizes segments within
the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Financial information is reported on the basis that it is
used internally by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) for evaluating segment performance and deciding how
to allocate resources to segments. The Company s chief executive officer has been identified as the CODM. 

Effective July 1, 2016, we changed the way
our CODM views our operating results by providing more discrete segment financial information. As a result, our reportable operating
segments now consist of Content Delivery and Real-Time. 

Content Delivery  - Our content delivery solutions product line consists of software, hardware and services for intelligently
streaming video content to a variety of consumer devices and storing and managing content in the network. Our streaming video and
storage products and services are deployed by service providers to support consumer-facing video services including live broadcast
video, video-on-demand and time-shifted video applications such as cloud based digital video recording. The Content Delivery segment
also includes Aquari, our unified scale-out storage solutions product line currently marketed to our content delivery and other
third-party customers. Additionally, the Content Delivery segment for the three months ended September 30, 2015 includes the results
of our multi-screen data analytics product line sold on September 9, 2015 (through the date of sale)   

Real-Time  - Our real-time solutions product line consist of real-time Linux operating system versions, development and
performance optimization tools, simulation software and other system software combined, in many cases, with computer platforms
and services. These real-time products are sold to a wide variety of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions
in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets around the world.

These operating segments were
determined based on the nature of the products and services offered and the nature and industry of customers serviced. The
measures that are used to assess the reportable segment s operating performance are  revenue, gross margin and
operating income. Operating income for reportable segments is defined as gross margin less selling and marketing, research
and development expenses, and certain general and administrative expenses. Any transactions between operating segments
are eliminated in consolidation. 

Additionally, corporate and unallocated
costs include certain corporate sales and marketing and corporate general and administrative expenses (executive, finance, legal,
risk management and human resources). These expenses are not included in the measure of segment operating income but are included
in the reconciliation to income (loss) before income taxes. 

Segment assets may be either directly
attributable or allocated to the operating segment depending on their nature. However, segment assets are not regularly
reviewed by the CODM for evaluating performance or allocating resources and therefore, are not presented. We recast our
segment footnote to conform the presentation with our current reportable segments.

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, our Board approved quarterly cash dividends as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, we recorded $287 of
dividends payable to holders of restricted common stock who held restricted shares at the time of the dividend record dates and
still hold those restricted shares as of September 30, 2016. Such dividends will be paid when the restrictions on a holder s
restricted common shares lapse. This dividend payable is divided between current payable and non-current payable in the amounts
of $95 and $192, respectively, based upon the expected vesting date of the underlying shares. These holders of restricted common
stock will receive the dividend payments as long as they remain eligible at the vesting date of the shares. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, $25 of dividends payable were forfeited and returned to capital for restricted shares that were forfeited
prior to meeting vesting requirements. Because the participants are not entitled to these dividends unless they complete the requisite
service period for the shares to vest, they are not  participating dividends  as defined under ASC Topic 260-10,  Earnings
per Share .

17.    Commitments and Contingencies    

From time to time, we are involved in litigation
incidental to the conduct of our business. We believe that such pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition. 

We enter into agreements in the ordinary course
of business with customers that often require us to defend and/or indemnify the customer against intellectual property infringement
claims brought by a third-party with respect to our products. For example, we were notified that certain of our customers have
settled with or been sued by the following companies, in the noted jurisdictions, regarding the listed patents: 

We continue to review our potential obligations
under our indemnification agreements with these customers and the indemnity obligations to these customers from other vendors that
also provided systems and services to these customers. From time to time, we also indemnify customers and business partners for
damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability,
and environmental claims relating to the use of our products and services or resulting from our acts or omissions, our employees,
authorized agents or subcontractors. We have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial
statements and do not expect any other material costs as a result of such obligations. The maximum potential amount of future payments
that we could be required to make is unlimited, and we are unable to estimate any possible loss or range of possible loss. 

Severance Arrangements  

Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements
with our executive officers and certain other employees, employment may be terminated by either the respective executive officer
or us at any time. In the event the employee voluntarily resigns (except as described below) or is terminated for cause, compensation
under the employment agreement will end. In the event an agreement is terminated by us without cause or in certain circumstances
constructively by us, the terminated employee will receive severance compensation for a period from 6 to 12 months, depending on
the officer, in an annualized amount equal to the respective employee's base salary then in effect. In the event our CEO resigns
within three months of a change in control or the CEO s agreement is terminated by us within one year of a change of control
other than for due cause, disability or non-renewal by our CEO, our CEO will be entitled to severance compensation multiplied by
two, as well as incremental medical costs. Additionally, if terminated, our CEO and CFO may be entitled to bonuses during the severance
period. At September 30, 2016, the maximum contingent liability under these agreements is $2,272. Our employment agreements
with certain of our employees contain certain offset provisions, as defined in their respective agreements.

Overview  

We provide software, hardware and professional
services for the content delivery market, storage solutions market and the high-performance, real-time market.  Effective July 1, 2016, we changed the way our chief operating decision maker views our operating results by providing
more discrete segment financial information. As a result, our reportable operating segments now consist of Content Delivery
and Real-Time. Our Content Delivery Segment includes both our content delivery solutions and Aquari storage product lines. 

Our content delivery solutions consist of software,

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

The following table sets forth our revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for each of our operating segments as well as comparative data showing increases
and decreases between periods (dollars in thousands): 

Product Revenue  - Total product revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7.9 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 7.5%, from $8.5 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. An analysis by operating segment is described below. 

Content Delivery  

Content delivery product revenue decreased
$1.5 million, or 38.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. Additionally, the
three months ended September 30, 2016 includes $0.2 million of revenue from our Aquari storage product solution. The period-over-period
decrease in content delivery product revenue resulted from the following: 

North American content delivery product revenue decreased by $1.7 million, or 50.4%. The current year period includes $0.2
million in revenue for sales of our Aquari storage systems to existing content delivery customers in North America; however, we
experienced an overall decline in content delivery system revenues due to delays in purchases from existing content delivery customers.   

European content delivery product revenue decreased by $0.4 million, or 81.0%. European content delivery product revenue fluctuates
from period to period primarily due to the product upgrade and expansion patterns of our customers.   

Asia-Pacific content delivery product revenue increased by $0.6 million, as our largest customer in Japan purchased systems
in the current period compared to no purchases in the prior year period. Included in this increase is approximately $0.1 million
from favorable foreign exchange rate changes.   

Fluctuation in content delivery product
revenue is often due to the fact that we have a small number of customers making periodic large purchases that account for a significant
percentage of revenue. Our content delivery product revenue is also subject to customers  capital spending cycles and may
be impacted in the future by consolidation of the industry in which our customers operate. 

Real-Time  

Real-time product revenue increased $0.9 million,
or 19.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The period-over-period increase in real-time
product revenue resulted primarily from the following: 

North American real-time product revenue decreased by $0.3 million, or 11.7%.   

23   

Asia-Pacific real-time product revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 41.8%, primarily in Japan. Included in this increase is
approximately $0.2 million from favorable foreign exchange rate changes.   

Revenue from defense contractors and the
government tend to vary by quarter and year, and are dependent upon government initiatives and funding availability. 

Service Revenue  - Total service revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $5.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 8.2%, from $4.9 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. An analysis by operating segment is described below. 

Content Delivery  

Content delivery services revenue increased
by $0.2 million, or 7.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period despite the loss of $0.5 million
in content delivery service revenue as a result of the sale of our multi-screen video analytics product line in September 2015.
The increase period-over-period is primarily due to (1) an increase in content delivery installations and out-of-warranty repairs
and (2) an increase in storage solutions installations. 

Real-Time  

Real-time service revenue increased by $0.2
million, or 9.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily due
to incremental time and material service projects in Japan. 

Gross Margin  

The following tables set forth our gross
margins and gross margin percentage of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for each of our operating
segments as well as comparative data showing increases and decreases between periods (dollars in thousands): 

Consolidated gross margin was $7.2 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 8.6%, from $7.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Consolidated gross margin percentage declined to 54.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 58.8%
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. An analysis by operating segment is described below. 

Total product gross margin was $4.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 19.3%, from $5.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Total product gross margin percentage declined to 51.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
59.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

24   

Total service gross margin was $3.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.3 million, or 10.6%, from $2.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Total service gross margin percentage increased to 59.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
58.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Content Delivery  

Segment gross margin dollars were $2.5 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 32.2%, from $3.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross margin dollars is due to the decrease in content delivery product revenue. The decline
in gross margin percentage of product revenue is primarily due to (1) lower gross margins on certain content delivery sales to
some of our larger customers and (2) lower than average gross margins on the sales of our Aquari storage product solution. 

An increase in gross margin dollars on content
delivery services revenue had a minimal impact on the overall change in segment gross margin dollars. However, an increase in service
gross margin percentage of service revenue was primarily due to higher services revenues from out-of-warranty repairs despite the
loss of high margin service revenue from our multi-screen video analytics product line, which was sold in September 2015. 

Real-Time  

Segment gross margin dollars were $4.7 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.5 million, or 12.8%, from $4.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in gross margin dollars is a primarily due to the increase in real-time product revenue. The slight
decline in gross margin percentage is primarily due a lower volume of high margin software-only sales period-over-period. 

An increase in gross margin dollars on real-time
services revenue had a minimal impact on the overall change in segment gross margin dollars. Service gross margin percentage of
service revenue remained stable period-over-period. 

Segment Operating Expenses  

Segment operating expenses include selling
and marketing, research and development expenses, and certain general and administrative expenses. The following tables set forth
our segment operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for each of our operating segments as well
as comparative data showing increases and decreases between periods (dollars in thousands): 

25   

Sales and Marketing  - Total operating
segment sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $0.8 million, or 25.8%, to $4.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. An analysis by operating segment is described
below. 

Content Delivery  

Segment sales and marketing expenses were
$2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.7 million, or 37.0%, from $1.9 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This period-over-period increase primarily resulted from (1) a $0.4 million increase in sales
personnel and related costs to help expand penetration of our existing products in our target markets and new markets for our Aquari
storage solutions product and (2) a $0.3 million increase in travel and trade show expenses to promote visibility of our products. 

Real-Time  

Segment sales and marketing expenses were
$1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.2 million, or 9.9%, from $1.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This period-over-period increase primarily resulted from an increase in sales personnel and related
costs. 

Research and Development  - Total
operating segment research and development expenses decreased approximately $0.5 million, or 13.8%, to $3.3 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. An analysis by operating
segment is described below. 

Content Delivery  

Segment research and development expenses
were $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 22.5%, from $2.9 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The period-over-period decrease primarily resulted from (1) a $0.5 million decrease from
a reduction of headcount in the U.S. within our development teams, (2) a $0.2 million decrease in subcontractor and outsourced
development costs, (3) a $0.2 million decrease in overall research and development expenses as a result of the sale of our multi-screen
video analytics product line in September 2015, primarily related to personnel costs, partially offset by (4) a $0.2 increase in
severance related to the reduced headcount noted above. 

Real-Time  

Segment research and development expenses
were $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.1 million, or 12.0%, from $1.0 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The period-over-period increase primarily resulted from an increase in personnel and related
costs. 

Segment Operating Income  

Segment operating income is defined as gross
margin less selling and marketing, research and development expenses, and certain general and administrative expenses. The following
tables set forth our segment operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for each of our operating
segments as well as comparative data showing increases and decreases between periods (dollars in thousands): 

26   

Total segment operating income decreased
approximately $1.0 million, or 167.0%, to a loss of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. An analysis by operating segment is described below. 

Content Delivery  

The period-over-period decrease primarily
resulted from lower product revenues and gross margin dollars, as described above. 

Real-Time  

The period-over-period increase primarily
resulted from higher product and services revenues and related gross margin dollars partially offset by slightly higher sales and
marketing and research and development costs, as described above. 

Corporate and Unallocated Costs  

Corporate and unallocated costs include
certain corporate sales and marketing and corporate general and administrative expenses (executive, finance, legal, risk management
and human resources). These expenses are not included in the measure of segment operating income but are included in the reconciliation
to income (loss) before income taxes. The following tables set forth our corporate and unallocated for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 as well as comparative data showing increases and decreases between periods (dollars in thousands): 

Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing
expenses increased approximately $0.2 million, or 157.4%, to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.2
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to (1) a $0.1 million increase related to
the addition of a sales executive in Europe starting in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year and (2) a $0.1 million increase
in outsourced marketing activities. 

General and Administrative.  General
and administrative expenses increased approximately $0.5 million, or 33.4%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to (1) a $0.4 million
increase in legal and other professional fees primarily associated with our entry into a Board Representation and Standstill Agreement
with an investor and affiliate of that investor and (2) a $0.2 million increase in personnel-related costs, including an increase
in share-based compensation costs. 

Gain on Sale of Product Line, net. 
During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we sold the customer contracts and intellectual property related to our multi-screen
video analytics product line for $3.5 million. The recorded net gain of $4.1 million included (1) customer contracts and intellectual
property with a net book value of $0.2 million, (2) related assets and liabilities not sold or transferred in the transaction of
$1.0 million (net liability, consisting primarily of unearned deferred revenue) and (3) legal, accounting and other expenses of
$0.2 million that would not have been incurred otherwise. 

27   

Other  

Other Income, net . During each of
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.1 million in net realized currency translation gains. These
gains and losses result from the impact of the changes in value of the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, relative to the U.S.
dollar, on foreign currency transactions related to short-term intercompany accounts which are settled in the normal course of
business by our European and Japanese subsidiaries for which the British pound, euro and Japanese yen are the functional currencies. 

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes.
 We recorded consolidated income tax expense of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a $0.1
million consolidated income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30,
2016, the domestic tax expense is higher than the prior year due to the full valuation allowance that is now being applied to any
tax benefit generated from operating losses in the U.S. The domestic expense is primarily attributable to interest and penalties
on uncertain tax positions and minimum state taxes in a number of jurisdictions for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
The foreign tax expense is lower than the prior year primarily due to (1) lower pretax book income in Japan and (2) a reduction
in the statutory tax rate in Japan for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period from the prior year. 

In jurisdictions other than the U.K. and
Japan, we either generate net operating losses or occasionally utilize some of the net operating loss carryforward amounts. However,
because of the cumulative accounting losses in those jurisdictions, we maintain a full valuation allowance on those losses. This
results in no net income tax provision impact in those jurisdictions as of September 30, 2016. 

Net Income (Loss).  Our consolidated
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.9 million, or a $0.32 loss per basic and diluted share, compared
to consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $3.2 million, or $0.35 income per basic and diluted
share. 

28   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our liquidity is dependent upon many factors,
including sales volume, product and service costs, operating results and the efficiency of asset use and turnover. Our future liquidity
will be affected by, among other things: 

our reliance on a small customer base, typically represented by a small number of large, concentrated orders (the largest three
customers accounted for 22% and 41% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, giving
effect to recent mergers and acquisitions);   

our content delivery product revenue is subject to customers  capital spending cycles and may be impacted in the future
by consolidation of the industry in which our customers operate;   

the rate of growth or decline or change in market, if any, of content delivery market expansions and the pace that video service
companies implement, upgrade or replace content delivery technology;   

our investment strategy into the storage solutions market;   

the impact of the global economic conditions on our business and our customers, including European Union austerity measures
and the impact of the U.K. exiting the European Union;   

our ability to renew maintenance and support service agreements with customers and retain existing customers;   

the impact of U.S. Government sequestration on our business and our customers;   

the rate of growth or decline, if any, of deployment of our real-time products;   

the actual versus anticipated decline in revenue from maintenance and product sales of real-time proprietary systems;   

our future access to capital;   

our ability to manage expenses consistent with the rate of growth or decline in our markets;   

our exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives;   

ongoing cost control actions and expenses, including capital expenditures;   

the margins on our product and service sales;   

timing of product shipments, which typically occur during the last month of the quarter;   

the impact of delays of product acceptance from our customers;   

the percentage of sales derived from outside the U.S. where there are generally longer accounts receivable collection cycles;   

the number of countries in which we operate, which may require maintenance of minimum cash levels in each country and, in certain
cases, may restrict the repatriation of cash, by requiring us to maintain levels of capital;   

the rate of growth or decline, if any, of sales to the government and government related entities; and   

the use of cash to pay quarterly and special dividends.   

Uses and Sources of Cash  

We generated $0.4 million and used $2.1
million of cash from operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating
cash flows during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to the collection of accounts
receivable for sales shipped late in the prior quarter, offset by the current period net loss and the timing of payments
made against our accounts payable to settle the previous quarter s inventory purchase and other obligations.
Operating cash outflows during the three months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily attributable to the timing of
payments made against our accounts payable subsequent to the prior fiscal year end to settle that quarter s
inventory purchase obligations.   

29   

We invested $0.3 million and $0.4 million in
property and equipment during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital additions during each of
these periods were primarily related to: (1) development and test equipment for our development group, (2) demonstration
systems used by our sales and marketing group and (3) facilities improvements. We expect capital additions to increase during
the remainder of our current fiscal year, primarily to support our continuing investment in our Aquari storage solutions product
line. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2015, we sold the customer contracts and intellectual property related to our multi-screen video analytics product line for $3.5
million. Cash proceeds from the transaction consisted of $2.8 million paid immediately after closing. The balance of the sales
price was collected in full in June 2016. 

We paid one quarterly cash dividend of $0.12
per share during each of the three months ended September, 2016 and 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, we also paid less than $0.1 million of additional dividends in each period that had been held as dividends payable from previous
declarations to restricted stockholders for whom restrictions lapsed during each period. We intend to pay a regular quarterly cash
dividend on shares of our common stock subject to, among other things, our results of operations, cash balances, future cash requirements,
financial condition, statutory requirements of Delaware law, and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. We believe that
a portion of our dividends may be treated as a return of capital to stockholders, rather than dividend income, as we believe dividend
payments may exceed our cumulative earnings and profits. 

Although we do not have any outstanding debt
or borrowing facilities in place at September 30, 2016, we periodically review the need for credit arrangements. However, based
upon our existing cash balances, historical cash usage, and anticipated operating cash flow in the near term, we believe that existing
cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital, capital expenditure requirements and any dividend payments
for at least the next twelve months. 

At September 30, 2016, we had working capital
(current assets less current liabilities) of $18.5 million including cash and cash equivalents of $19.3 million. At June 30, 2016,
we had working capital of $22.6 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $20.3 million. At September 30, 2016, we had no
material commitments for capital expenditures. 

As
of September 30, 2016, approximately $2.1 million, or 11.0% of our cash is in foreign accounts and there is no expectation that
any foreign cash would need to be transferred from these foreign accounts to cover operations in the next 12 months.  Based
upon our existing cash balances and short-term investments, historical cash usage and anticipated operating cash flow in the current
fiscal year, we believe that existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital, dividend payments
and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We provide indemnifications of varying scope
and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of
our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the
degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations
did not have a material impact on our financial statements during the periods presented. See Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies
to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the additional disclosures regarding indemnification. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The SEC defines  critical accounting estimates 
as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.  Our
critical accounting policies and estimates are disclosed under the section   Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.
Our critical accounting estimates have not changed in any material respect during the three months ended September 30, 2016.
