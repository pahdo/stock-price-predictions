     Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements    
   (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)        
       Note 1. Principal Business and Organization
      FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC), or the Company, was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State
of Maryland on December 21, 2007 and formally commenced investment operations on January 2, 2009. The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a
business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, the Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated
investment company, or RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had two wholly-owned financing subsidiaries and four wholly-owned subsidiaries
through which it holds equity interests in non-controlled portfolio companies. The consolidated financial statements include both the Company s accounts and the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.      The Company s investment objectives are to
generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private U.S. companies. The Company seeks to generate superior risk-adjusted returns by
focusing on debt investments in a broad array of private U.S. companies, including middle market companies, which the Company defines as companies with annual revenues of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment. The Company may
purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the  over-the-counter  market or directly from the Company s target companies as
primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with the Company s debt investments, the Company may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. The Company may also purchase or
otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or
other equity, in the Company s target companies, generally in conjunction with one of the Company s debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In
addition, a portion of the Company s portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps.   
   Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies        Basis of Presentation:  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for
interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. For a more complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other information, the
Company s interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s annual report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The
December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet and consolidated schedule of investments are derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company is considered
an investment company under GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies under Accounting

Standards Update No. 2013-08,  Financial Services Investment Companies . The Company has evaluated the impact of subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements
were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.       Use of Estimates:  The preparation
of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Many of the amounts have been rounded, and all amounts are in thousands, except share
and per share amounts.       Capital Gains Incentive Fee:  At the Company s 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, the
Company received stockholder approval to amend and restate the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, dated February 12, 2008 (as amended on August 5, 2008), or the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement,
by and between the Company and FB Income Advisor, LLC, or FB Advisor, effective upon a listing of the Company s shares of common stock on a national securities exchange. The Company s shares of common stock were listed and commenced
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, on April 16, 2014. On April 16, 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement, or the April 2014 investment advisory agreement, with FB Advisor. Also on
April 16, 2014, the Company entered into an administration agreement with FB Advisor, or the administration agreement, which governs the administrative services provided to the Company by FB Advisor that had previously been addressed in the 2008
investment advisory and administrative services agreement.      At a special meeting of stockholders of the Company that was
adjourned on June 23, 2014 and reconvened on July 17, 2014, the Company received stockholder approval to amend and restate the April 2014 investment advisory agreement. On July 17, 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated investment
advisory agreement, or the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, with FB Advisor.      Pursuant to the terms of each of the
2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory agreement and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of
each calendar year (or upon termination of such agreement). Such fee will equal 20.0% of the Company s incentive fee capital gains (i.e., the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end
of the applicable period, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues for the
capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.      While none of
the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory agreement or the July 2014 investment advisory agreement include or contemplate the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the
capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, the Company includes unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital
gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to FB Advisor if the Company s entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet
date even though FB Advisor is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.

    Subordinated Income Incentive Fee:  Pursuant to the terms of each of the 2008
investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory agreement and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, FB Advisor may also be entitled to receive a subordinated incentive fee on income. The
subordinated incentive fee on income under the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, which was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equaled 20.0% of the Company s  pre-incentive fee net investment
income  for the immediately preceding quarter and was subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, as defined in the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, equal to 2.0% per quarter,
or an annualized hurdle rate of 8.0%. As a result, FB Advisor did not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeded the hurdle rate of 2.0%. Once the
Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeded the hurdle rate, FB Advisor was entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate,
until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equaled 2.5%, or 10.0% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FB Advisor received 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income. Under the April 2014 investment
advisory agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income was calculated in the same manner, except that the hurdle rate used to compute the subordinated incentive fee on income was based on the value of the Company s net assets rather than
adjusted capital.      Under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, the hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on the
value of the Company s net assets, was reduced from 2.0% to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. As a result, FB Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net
investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FB Advisor will be entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the
amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375%, or 9.375% annually, of net assets. Thereafter, FB Advisor will be
entitled to receive 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income.      Under both the April 2014 investment advisory agreement
and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be
payable except to the extent that 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the eleven
preceding calendar quarters. Accordingly, any subordinated incentive fee on income that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for
such calendar quarter exceeds the applicable quarterly hurdle rate, subject to the  catch-up  provision, and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then-current and eleven preceding
calendar quarters  minus  (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the eleven preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the  cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations  is the sum of
pre-incentive fee net investment income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters. There will be no accumulation of
amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and, accordingly, there will be no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the applicable quarterly hurdle rate and there will be no delay of payment if prior quarters
are below the applicable quarterly hurdle rate.

    Partial Loan Sales:  The Company follows the guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 860,  Transfers and   Servicing , or ASC Topic 860, when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. This guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a
participating interest, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on the Company s consolidated balance
sheets and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the participation or other partial loan sale meets the definition. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair
value. See Note 8 for additional information.       Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in the unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 may have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used to prepare the
unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. These reclassifications had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as
previously reported.      In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest , or ASU 2015-03, to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under pre-existing guidance, debt issuance costs were recognized as a deferred charge and
presented as an asset on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability for indebtedness be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that liability,
consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15,  Interest Imputation of Interest,  or ASU 2015-15, to update the guidance to include SEC staff views regarding the presentation and
subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC indicated that it would not
object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding
borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.      Commencing January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and changed its
method of disclosing debt issuance costs for its repurchase agreement and unsecured notes. ASU 2015-03 affects the presentation and disclosure of such costs in the Company s financial statements. There is no change to the Company s
recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. In accordance with ASU 2015-15, the Company elected to continue to present debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset, unchanged from its prior method of
disclosure.      Comparative financial statements of prior interim and annual periods have been adjusted to apply the new method
retrospectively. The adoption and retrospective adjustment of ASU 2015-03 had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as previously reported.

    Note 3. Share Transactions    
  Below is a summary of transactions with respect to shares of the Company s common stock during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015:       
    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 641,574 shares of common stock
pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan, or DRP, for gross proceeds of $5,665 at an average price per share of $8.83 and the administrator for the Company s DRP purchased 1,232,012 shares of common stock in the open market at an average
price per share of $9.10 (totaling $11,216) pursuant to the Company s DRP, and distributed such shares to participants in the Company s DRP. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued 1,377,813 shares of common
stock pursuant to its DRP for gross proceeds of $13,631 at an average price per share of $9.89. During the period from October 1, 2016 to November 8, 2016, the Company issued an additional 574,726 shares of common stock pursuant to its DRP
for gross proceeds of $5,426 at an average price per share of $9.44. For additional information regarding the terms of the DRP, see Note 5.   
   Note 4. Related Party Transactions    
   Compensation of the Investment Adviser       Pursuant to the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory agreement and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, FB Advisor is entitled
to an annual base management fee based on the average value of the Company s gross assets and an incentive fee based on the Company s performance. The Company commenced accruing fees under the 2008 investment advisory and
administrative services agreement on January 2, 2009, upon commencement of the Company s investment operations. Base management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. The annual base management fees under the 2008 investment advisory
and administrative services agreement and the April 2014 investment advisory agreement were equal to 2.0% of the average value of the Company s gross assets.      In anticipation of the listing of the Company s shares of common stock on the NYSE, FB Advisor recommended that the April 2014 investment advisory agreement be further amended to (i) reduce the
annualized hurdle rate used in connection with the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income, expressed as a rate of return on the Company s net assets, from 8% to 7.5% and (ii) assuming the reduction to the hurdle rate was
approved, reduce the base management fee from 2.0% to 1.75% of the average value of the Company s gross assets. At a special meeting of stockholders that was adjourned on June 23, 2014 and reconvened on July 17, 2014, the Company received
stockholder approval to amend and restate the April 2014 investment advisory agreement to reflect the amendments approved by the Company s stockholders. On July 17, 2014, the Company entered into the July 2014 investment advisory agreement.
While stockholder approval of the proposal was pending, FB Advisor agreed, effective April 1, 2014, to waive a portion of the base management fee to which it was entitled under the April 2014 investment advisory agreement so that the fee received
equaled 1.75% of the average value of the Company s gross assets.

   The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part of the incentive fee, which is
referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, and equals 20.0% of the Company s  pre-incentive fee net investment income  for the immediately preceding quarter. Under the 2008
investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income was subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, as defined in the 2008 investment advisory and administrative
services agreement, equal to 2.0% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 8.0%. As a result, FB Advisor did not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter
exceeded the hurdle rate of 2.0%. Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeded the hurdle rate, FB Advisor was entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net
investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equaled 2.5%, or 10.0% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FB Advisor received 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net
investment income. Under the April 2014 investment advisory agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income was calculated in the same manner, except that the hurdle rate used to compute the subordinated incentive fee on income was based on the
value of the Company s net assets rather than adjusted capital.      Under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, the
hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets, was reduced from 2.0% to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. As a result, FB Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter
until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FB Advisor will be entitled
to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375%, or 9.375% annually, of
the value of the Company s net assets. Thereafter, FB Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income.      Under both the April 2014 investment advisory agreement and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a total return requirement, which provides
that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent that 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then-current and eleven
preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the eleven preceding calendar quarters. Accordingly, any subordinated incentive fee on income that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the
lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the applicable quarterly hurdle rate, subject to the  catch-up  provision, and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the
cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters  minus  (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the eleven preceding calendar quarters. For the
foregoing purpose, the  cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations  is the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
the Company for the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters. There will be no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and, accordingly, there will be no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent
quarters are below the applicable quarterly hurdle rate and there will be no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the applicable quarterly hurdle rate.

   The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on
capital gains, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the July 2014 investment advisory agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of the Company s incentive fee capital gains, which equal the
Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate
amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. The Company accrues for the capital gains incentive fee, which, if earned, is paid annually. The Company accrues the incentive fee based on net realized and unrealized gains; however, the
fee payable to FB Advisor is based on realized gains and no such fee is payable with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. The methodology for calculating the capital gains incentive fee is identical under
the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory agreement and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement.      Pursuant to an investment sub-advisory agreement, or the investment sub-advisory agreement, between FB Advisor and GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, or GDFM, GDFM will receive 50% of all
management and incentive fees payable to FB Advisor under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement with respect to each year.      Pursuant to the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the Company reimbursed FB Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company s administration
and operations. The amount of this reimbursement was set at the lesser of (1) FB Advisor s actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimated it would be required to pay alternative service
providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FB Advisor was required to allocate the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The
Company s board of directors then assessed the reasonableness of such reimbursements based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining similar services from third-party
providers known to be available. In addition, the Company s board of directors considered whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the
Company s board of directors compared the total amount paid to FB Advisor for such services as a percentage of the Company s net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs.   
  Pursuant to the administration agreement, the Company reimburses FB Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the
Company s administration and operations, including FB Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of Franklin Square Holdings, L.P., or FS Investments, providing administrative services to the
Company on behalf of FB Advisor. The Company reimburses FB Advisor no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FB Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the administration agreement. FB
Advisor allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Company s board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how
the expenses are allocated to the Company and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among the Company and certain affiliates of FB Advisor. The Company s board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements
for expenses allocated to the Company based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, the

whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Company s board of directors compares the total
amount paid to FB Advisor for such services as a percentage of the Company s net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs.      The following table describes the fees and expenses accrued under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement and the administration agreement, as applicable, during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015:       

(2)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reversed capital gains incentive fees of $18,418 based on the performance of its portfolio, all of which
was based on unrealized gains and none of which is payable by the Company unless and until those gains are actually realized. The Company paid FB Advisor no capital gains incentive fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of
September 30, 2016, no capital gains incentive fees were accrued.     

(4)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $2,633 and $2,318, respectively, of administrative services expenses related to the allocation of costs of
administrative personnel for services rendered to the Company by FB Advisor and the remainder related to other reimbursable expenses. The Company paid $3,078 and $3,782, respectively, in administrative services expenses to FB Advisor during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.         Potential Conflicts of Interest    
  FB Advisor s senior management team is comprised of substantially the same personnel as the senior management teams of FS Investment
Advisor, LLC, FSIC II Advisor, LLC, FSIC III Advisor, LLC, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC and FS Global Advisor, LLC, the investment advisers to certain other BDCs and a closed-end management investment company affiliated with FS Investments. As a result,
such personnel provide investment advisory services to the Company and each of FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV and FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund. While none of

LLC or FS Global Advisor, LLC, is currently making private corporate debt investments for clients other than the Company, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment
Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV or FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund, respectively, any, or all, may do so in the future. In the event that FB Advisor undertakes to provide investment advisory services to other clients in the future,
it intends to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies, if necessary, so that the Company will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other client of FB
Advisor or its management team. In addition, even in the absence of FB Advisor retaining additional clients, it is possible that some investment opportunities may be provided to FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment
Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV and/or FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund rather than to the Company.       Exemptive Relief
      As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally
are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in
transactions where price is the only negotiated term. In an order dated June 4, 2013, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated
investment transactions with certain affiliates of FB Advisor, including FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV and any future BDCs that are advised by FB Advisor or its
affiliated investment advisers, or collectively the Company s co-investment affiliates. The Company believes this relief has and may continue to enhance its ability to further its investment objectives and strategy. The Company believes this
relief may also increase favorable investment opportunities for it, in part, by allowing the Company to participate in larger investments, together with its co-investment affiliates, than would be available to the Company if such relief had not been
obtained. Because the Company did not seek exemptive relief to engage in co-investment transactions with GDFM and its affiliates, the Company is permitted to co-invest with GDFM and its affiliates only in accordance with existing regulatory guidance
(e.g., where price is the only negotiated term).       Trademark License Agreement    
  On April 16, 2014, in connection with the listing of its common stock on the NYSE, the Company entered into a trademark license agreement,
or the trademark license agreement, with FS Investments. Pursuant to the trademark license agreement, FS Investments granted the Company a non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free right and license to use the name  FS Investment
Corporation  and certain other trademarks, or the licensed marks, as a component of the Company s name (and in connection with marketing the investment advisory and other services that FB Advisor may provide to the Company). Other than
with respect to this limited license, the Company has no other rights to the licensed marks. The trademark license agreement may be terminated by FS Investments or the Company on sixty days  prior written notice and expires if FB Advisor or one
of FS Investments  affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Company. Furthermore, FS Investments may terminate the trademark license agreement at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that FS Investments or the Company
receives notice of any third-party claim arising out of the Company s use of the licensed marks or if the Company attempts to assign or sublicense the trademark license agreement or any of the Company s rights or duties under the trademark
license agreement without the prior written consent of FS Investments. FB Advisor is a third-party beneficiary of the trademark license agreement.

    Note 5. Distributions       The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that the Company has declared on its common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   
   
    On November 2, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash
distribution of $0.22275 per share, which will be paid on or about January 4, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2016. The timing and amount of any future distributions to stockholders are subject to
applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company s board of directors.      Pursuant to the
Company s DRP, the Company will reinvest all cash dividends or distributions declared by the Company s board of directors on behalf of stockholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if the Company s
board of directors declares a distribution, then stockholders who have not elected to  opt out  of the DRP will have their distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock.   
  With respect to each distribution pursuant to the DRP, the Company reserves the right to either issue new shares of common stock or
purchase shares of common stock in the open market in connection with implementation of the DRP. Unless the Company, in its sole discretion, otherwise directs the plan administrator, (A) if the per share market price (as defined in the DRP) is equal
to or greater than the estimated net asset value per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of the Company s common stock on the payment date for the distribution, then the Company will issue shares of common stock at the greater of (i)
net asset value per share of common stock or (ii) 95% of the market price; or (B) if the market price is less than the net asset value per share, then, in the sole discretion of the Company, (i) shares of common stock will be purchased in open
market transactions for the accounts of participants to the extent practicable, or (ii) the Company will issue shares of common stock at net asset value per share. Pursuant to the terms of the DRP, the number of shares of common stock to be issued
to a participant will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to a participant by the price per share at which the Company issues such shares; provided, however, that shares purchased in open market transactions
by the plan administrator will be allocated to a participant based on the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of common stock purchased in the open market.   
  If a stockholder receives distributions in the form of common stock pursuant to the DRP, such stockholder generally will be subject to
the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if it elected to receive distributions in cash. If the Company s common stock is trading at or below net asset value, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional common
stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of cash that they would have received if they had elected to receive the distribution in cash. If the

Company s common stock is trading above net asset value, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the
amount of the fair market value of the Company s common stock. The stockholder s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of common stock received in a distribution will be equal to the total dollar amount of the distribution
payable to the stockholder. Any stock received in a distribution will have a holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares of common stock are credited to the stockholder s account.   
  The Company may fund its cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds legally available to it, including proceeds from
the sale of shares of the Company s common stock, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, and dividends or other distributions paid
to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. During certain periods, the
Company s distributions may exceed its earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions the Company makes may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder s investment
rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on the
sale of securities, and/or a return of capital, which is a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to the Company s stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all.
     The following table reflects the sources of the cash distributions on a tax basis that the Company has paid on its common
stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       

(1)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 90.6% and 93.6%, respectively, of the Company s gross investment income was attributable to cash income
earned, 2.0% and 2.2%, respectively, was attributable to non-cash accretion of discount and 7.4% and 4.2%, respectively, was attributable to paid-in-kind, or PIK, interest.     
  The Company s net investment income on a tax basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $156,642 and $164,390,
respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $152,324 and $158,249 of undistributed net investment income, respectively, and $45,008 and $35,010, respectively, of accumulated capital losses on a tax basis.

       Note 5. Distributions (continued)
       
   The difference between the Company s GAAP-basis net investment income and its
tax-basis net investment income is primarily due to the reclassification of unamortized original issue discount and prepayment fees recognized upon prepayment of loans from income for GAAP purposes to realized gains for tax purposes.   
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation between GAAP-basis net investment income and tax-basis net investment income during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       
    The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions is made annually as of the
end of the Company s fiscal year based upon the Company s taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax
attributes of the Company s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis were as follows:

(1)  
  Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, net capital losses recognized for tax years beginning after December 22, 2010 may be carried
forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term or long-term losses. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had short-term and long-term capital loss carryforwards available to offset future realized capital gains of $2,919
and $42,089, respectively.

   The aggregate cost of the Company s investments for U.S. federal income tax
purposes totaled $4,021,994 and $4,216,052 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The aggregate net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on a tax basis was $(77,810) and $(178,724) as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.      As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred tax liability of $13,603
resulting from unrealized appreciation on investments held by the Company s wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries and a deferred tax asset of $16,630 resulting from net operating losses of the Company s wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries. As of
September 30, 2016, certain wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries anticipated that they would be unable to fully utilize their generated net operating losses, therefore the deferred tax asset was offset by a valuation allowance of $3,027. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not record a provision for taxes related to wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries.       Note 6. Investment Portfolio       The following table summarizes the
composition of the Company s investment portfolio at cost and fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

  Amortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on investments.
       As of September 30, 2016, except for JW Aluminum Co., in which the Company had a second lien secured loan
investment and two equity/other investments, the Company did not  control  any of its portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, except for ASG Technologies Group, Inc. (formerly Allen Systems Group,
Inc.), in which the Company had two senior secured loan investments and two equity/other investments, and Fronton Investor Holdings, LLC, in which the Company had an equity/other investment, the Company was not an  affiliated person  of
any of its portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act.      As of December 31, 2015, except for JW Aluminum Co., in
which the Company had a second lien secured loan investment and two equity/other investments, the Company did not  control  any of its portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2015, except for Allen Systems
Group, Inc., in which the Company had a senior secured loan investment and an equity/other investment, and Fronton Investor Holdings, LLC, in which the Company had an equity/other investment, the Company was not an  affiliated person  of
any of its portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act.

       Note 6. Investment Portfolio (continued)
       
   In general, under the 1940 Act, the Company would be presumed to  control  a
portfolio company if it owned more than 25% of its voting securities or it had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company, and would be an  affiliated person  of a portfolio company if it owned
5% or more of its voting securities.      The Company s investment portfolio may contain loans and other unfunded
arrangements that are in the form of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, delayed draw credit facilities or other investments, which require the Company to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms
of the underlying agreements. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had nineteen unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $137,196. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had nineteen unfunded debt investments with
aggregate unfunded commitments of $129,660, one unfunded commitment to purchase up to $467 in shares of preferred stock of Altus Power America Holdings, LLC and one unfunded equity investment in Sunnova Holdings, LLC with an unfunded commitment of
$123. The Company maintains sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. For additional details regarding the Company s unfunded debt investments, see the Company s unaudited
consolidated schedule of investments as of September 30, 2016 and the Company s audited consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2015.      The table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such industries as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:

    Note 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
  Under existing accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. This accounting guidance emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are
inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The Company classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy as defined by current
accounting guidance:       Level 1 : Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.       Level 2 : Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.   
   Level 3 : Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability.   
  A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s investments were
categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy:       
    The Company has elected the fair value option under ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments , relating
to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value for its secured borrowings which arose due to partial loan sales which did not meet the criteria for sale treatment under ASC Topic 860. The Company reports changes in the fair value of its
secured borrowing as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on secured borrowing in the consolidated statements of operations. The net gain or loss reflects the difference between the fair value and the principal
amount due on maturity.      The secured borrowing as of September 30, 2016 was valued using Level 3 inputs under the fair
value hierarchy. The Company s approach to determining fair value of the Level 3 secured borrowing is consistent with its approach to determining fair value of the Level 3 investments that are associated with the secured borrowing. See Note 2
and Note 8 for additional information.

       Note 7. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments (continued)        
   As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s secured
borrowing was categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy:       
    The Company s investments as of September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that
were acquired directly from the issuer. Sixty-two senior secured loan investments, three senior secured bond investments and fifteen subordinated debt investments, for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by independent valuation
firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features and other
relevant terms of the debt. Except as described below, all of the Company s equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors,
contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or
liquidation value. Two equity investments, which were traded on an active public market, were valued at their respective closing price as of September 30, 2016. Except as described above, the Company valued its other investments by using the
midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services.   
  The Company s investments as of December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the
issuer. Sixty senior secured loan investments, three senior secured bond investments, fourteen subordinated debt investments and one collateralized security, for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by independent valuation firms,
which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features and other
relevant terms of the debt. Except as described below, all of the Company s equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors,
contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. One equity investment, which was traded on an
active public market, was valued at its closing price as of December 31, 2015. Two senior secured loan investments, which were newly issued and purchased near December 31, 2015, were valued at cost as the Company s board of directors
determined that the cost of each such investment was the best indication of its fair value. Except as described above, the Company valued its other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of
the relevant period end, which were provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services.      The Company periodically benchmarks the bid and ask prices it receives from the third-party pricing services and/or dealers, as applicable, against the actual prices at which the Company purchases and
sells its

investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of the Company s management in purchasing and selling these investments, the Company believes that these prices
are reliable indicators of fair value. However, because of the private nature of this marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), the Company believes that these valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 within the fair
value hierarchy. The Company may also use other methods, including the use of an independent valuation firm, to determine fair value for securities for which it cannot obtain prevailing bid and ask prices through third-party pricing services or
independent dealers, or where the Company s board of directors otherwise determines that the use of such other methods is appropriate. The Company periodically benchmarks the valuations provided by the independent valuation firms against the
actual prices at which the Company purchases and sells its investments. The valuation committee of the Company s board of directors, or the valuation committee, and the board of directors, reviewed and approved the valuation determinations made
with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with the Company s valuation policy.      The following is a
reconciliation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of investments for which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) were used in determining fair value:   

(1)  
  There was one transfer of an investment from Level 3 to Level 1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. It is the Company s policy to recognize transfers
between levels at the beginning of the reporting period.

    Broad Street Credit Facility    
  On January 28, 2011, Broad Street Funding LLC, or Broad Street, the Company s former wholly-owned, special-purpose financing
subsidiary, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, or Deutsche Bank, and the other lenders party thereto entered into an amended and restated multi-lender, syndicated revolving credit facility, or the Broad Street credit facility, which amended and
restated the revolving credit facility that Broad Street originally entered into with Deutsche Bank on March 10, 2010 and the amendments thereto. On December 15, 2015, Broad Street and Deutsche Bank entered into an amendment to the
facility which extended the maturity date to January 19, 2016. The Broad Street credit facility matured and terminated on January 19, 2016. The Broad Street credit facility provided for borrowings of up to $125,000 at a rate of LIBOR, for
an interest period equal to the weighted average LIBOR interest period of debt securities owned by Broad Street, plus 1.50% per annum. Deutsche Bank was a lender and served as administrative agent under the facility.   
  Under the Broad Street credit facility, the Company transferred debt securities to Broad Street from time to time as a contribution to
capital and retained a residual interest in the contributed debt securities through its ownership of Broad Street. The obligations of Broad Street under the facility were non-recourse to the Company and its exposure under the facility was limited to
the value of its investment in Broad Street.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no amounts remained
outstanding under the Broad Street credit facility. The Company incurred costs of $2,566 in connection with obtaining and amending the facility, which the Company recorded as deferred financing costs on its consolidated balance sheets and
amortized to interest expense over the life of the facility. As of September 30, 2016, all of the deferred financing costs have been amortized to interest expense.      For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of total interest expense for the Broad Street credit facility were as follows:   
   
    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the cash paid for interest expense, average
borrowings, effective interest rate and weighted average interest rate for the Broad Street credit facility were as follows:

  Interest under the Broad Street credit facility was paid quarterly in arrears.

  The average borrowings under the Broad Street credit facility were calculated for the period the Company had borrowings outstanding under the facility. The weighted
average interest rate presented for periods of less than one year is annualized.        Borrowings of Broad Street
were considered borrowings of the Company for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act.   
   ING Credit Facility       On
April 3, 2014, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with ING Capital LLC, or ING, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, or the ING credit facility. The ING credit facility provides for borrowings
in U.S. dollars and certain agreed upon foreign currencies in an initial aggregate amount of up to $300,000, with an option for the Company to request, at one or more times after closing, that existing or new lenders, at their election, provide up
to $100,000 of additional commitments. The ING credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount not to exceed $25,000. The Company s obligations under the ING credit facility are guaranteed by all of
the Company s subsidiaries, other than its special-purpose financing subsidiaries. The Company s obligations under the ING credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company
and the subsidiary guarantors thereunder other than the equity interests of its special-purpose financing subsidiaries.      As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $81,286 and $34,625, respectively, was outstanding under the ING credit facility, which includes borrowings in Euro in an aggregate amount of  42,963 and  29,125, respectively. The
carrying amount of the amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value. The Company incurred costs of $3,406 in connection with obtaining the ING credit facility, which the Company has recorded as deferred financing costs on its
consolidated balance sheets and amortizes to interest expense over the life of the facility. As of September 30, 2016, $573 of such deferred financing costs had yet to be amortized to interest expense.   
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of total interest expense for the ING credit facility
were as follows:

        JPM Financing       On July 21, 2011, through its two wholly-owned, special-purpose financing subsidiaries, Locust Street Funding LLC, or Locust Street, and Race Street Funding LLC, or Race Street, the Company entered into a
debt financing arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, or JPM, which has been subsequently amended from time to time. The Company elected to structure the financing in the manner described more fully below in order to, among other
things, obtain such financing at a lower cost than would be available through alternate arrangements. The Company and JPM most recently amended the financing arrangement on April 28, 2016 to, among other things, reduce the amount of outstanding
available debt financing from $725,000 to $650,000.      Pursuant to the financing arrangement, the assets held by Locust Street
secure the obligations of Locust Street under certain Class A Floating Rate Notes, or the Class A Notes, issued by Locust Street to Race Street pursuant to the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of September 26, 2012 and as supplemented by
Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated April 23, 2013, Supplemental Indenture No. 2, dated May 8, 2015, Supplemental Indenture No. 3, dated March 1, 2016, and Supplemental Indenture No. 4, dated April 28, 2016, in each case, with Citibank N.A., as
trustee, or the Amended and Restated Indenture. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes issued by Locust Street remaining outstanding is $780,000. All principal and interest on the Class A
Notes will be due and payable on the stated maturity date of April 15, 2024. Race Street has purchased all Class A Notes issued by Locust Street at a purchase price equal to their par value.   
  Race Street, in turn, has entered into an amended repurchase transaction with JPM pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated global
master repurchase agreement, or the Amended and Restated Global Master Repurchase Agreement, and the related annex and amended and restated confirmation thereto, each dated as of April 28, 2016, or, collectively, the JPM Facility. Pursuant to the
JPM Facility, JPM has purchased the $780,000 of Class A Notes held by Race Street for a purchase price equal to $650,000. Under the JPM Facility, Race Street will, on a quarterly basis, repurchase the Class A Notes sold to JPM under the JPM Facility
and subsequently resell the Class A Notes to JPM. The final repurchase transaction must occur no later than April 15, 2017. The repurchase price paid by Race Street to JPM for each repurchase of Class A Notes will be equal to the purchase price paid
by JPM for the Class A Notes, plus interest thereon accrued at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum. Race Street is permitted to reduce (based on certain thresholds during specific periods) the aggregate principal amount of Class A Notes subject to the
JPM Facility. Such reductions, and any other reductions of the principal amount of Class A Notes, including upon an

Facility.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Class A Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$780,000 and $960,000, respectively, had been purchased by Race Street from Locust Street and subsequently sold to JPM under the JPM Facility for aggregate proceeds of $650,000 and $800,000, respectively. The carrying amount outstanding under the
JPM Facility approximates its fair value. The Company funded each purchase of Class A Notes by Race Street through a capital contribution to Race Street. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Race Street s liability
under the JPM Facility was $650,000 and $800,000, plus $4,577 and $5,633, respectively, of accrued interest expense. The Class A Notes issued by Locust Street and purchased by Race Street eliminate in consolidation on the Company s
financial statements.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of assets held by Locust

  The indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to comply with the asset coverage requirements of
Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act, as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, whether or not it is subject to those requirements, and to provide financial information to the holders of the 4.000% notes and U.S. Bank if the Company

    Partial Loan Sale       Certain partial loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860 because these sales do not meet the definition of a participating interest, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale
treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain as an investment on the consolidated balance sheets and the portion sold is recorded as a secured borrowing in
the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets. For these partial loan sales, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within interest income and the interest earned by the buyer in the partial loan sale is recorded
within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.      As of September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a
secured borrowing at fair value of $2,863 and the fair value of the loan that is associated with the secured borrowing was $14,907. The secured borrowing was the result of the Company s completion of a partial sale of a senior secured loan
associated with one portfolio company that did not meet the definition of a participating interest. As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and the partial loan sale was treated as a secured borrowing.   
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was a partial loan sale of $2,829 which was issued at a discount to par
of $28, and no fundings on revolving and delayed draw secured borrowings or repayments on secured borrowings.      For the three

(3)  
  The per share data for distributions reflect the actual amount of distributions paid per share during the applicable period.     

(4)  
  The issuance of common stock on a per share basis reflects the incremental net asset value changes as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock, as applicable,
pursuant to the Company s DRP. The issuance of common stock at a price that is greater than the net asset value per share results in an increase in net asset value per share. The per share impact of the Company s DRP is an increase to the
net asset value of less than $0.01 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015.         

(5)  
  The total return based on net asset value for each period presented was calculated by taking the net asset value per share as of the end of the applicable period,
adding the cash distributions per share that were declared during the period and dividing the total by the net asset value per share at the beginning of the period. Total return based on net asset value does not consider the effect of any sales
commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of the Company s common stock. The historical calculation of total return based on net asset value in the table should not be considered a representation of the
Company s future total return based on net asset value, which may be greater or less than the return shown in the table due to a number of factors, including the Company s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its
investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of the Company s expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which
the Company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. The total return
calculations set forth above represent the total return on the Company s investment portfolio during the applicable period and do not represent an actual return to stockholders.     

(6)  
  The total return based on market value for each period presented was calculated based on the change in market price during the applicable period, including the impact
of distributions reinvested in accordance with the Company s DRP. Total return based on market value does not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of the
Company s common stock. The historical calculation of total return based on market value in the table should not be considered a representation of the Company s future total return based on market value, which may be greater or less than
the return shown in the table due to a number of factors, including the Company s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires,
the level of the Company s expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets, general economic conditions and fluctuations
in per share market value. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.

  Weighted average net assets during the applicable period are used for this calculation. The following is a schedule of supplemental ratios for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015:

  Asset coverage per unit is the ratio of the carrying value of the Company s total consolidated assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior
securities, to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness.         Note 11. Subsequent Events
       Term Loan Agreement and Termination of the JPM Repurchase Facility    
  On November 1, 2016, Locust Street entered into a Loan Agreement with JPM, as lender and Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., as
Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary, and Virtus Group, LP, as Collateral Administrator, or the Locust Street Term Loan Facility, pursuant to which JPM advanced $625,000 to Locust Street. The outstanding advances bear interest at a rate
equal to LIBOR for a three-month interest period plus a spread of 2.6833% per annum. Interest is payable in arrears beginning on January 15, 2017 and each quarter thereafter. Under the Locust Street Term Loan Facility, Locust Street has agreed
to prepay $200,000 of the aggregate principal amount of the advances on or before January 31, 2017, and thereafter all outstanding advances under the Locust Street Term Loan Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder, will
be due and payable on November 1, 2020.      In connection with the Locust Street Term Loan Facility, the Company, Locust Street,
Race Street and JPM terminated the JPM Facility by (i) effecting a redemption of the Class A Notes issued by Locust Street to Race Street pursuant to the Amended and Restated Indenture and (ii) terminating the Amended and Restated Global Master
Repurchase Agreement.

reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the

  We were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on December 21, 2007 and formally commenced
investment operations on January 2, 2009. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.      On April 16, 2014, shares of our
common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol  FSIC . This listing accomplished our goal of providing our stockholders with greatly enhanced liquidity.   
  Our investment activities are managed by FB Advisor and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. Under
the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay FB Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. FB Advisor has engaged GDFM to act as our
investment sub-adviser. GDFM assists FB Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FB Advisor according to guidelines set by FB Advisor.   
  Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We have identified and
intend to focus on the following investment categories, which we believe will allow us to generate an attractive total return with an acceptable level of risk.       Direct Originations:  We intend to leverage our relationship with GDFM and its global sourcing and origination platform, including its industry relationships, to directly source investment
opportunities. Such investments are originated or structured for us or made by us and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments may include both debt and equity components, although we do not generally make equity
investments independent of having an existing credit relationship. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.   
   Opportunistic:  We intend to seek to capitalize on market price inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds and other securities
where the market price of such investment reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by our fundamental analysis. We believe that market price inefficiencies may occur due to, among other things, general dislocations in the markets, a
misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an industry being out of favor with the broader investment community. We seek to allocate capital to these securities that have been misunderstood or mispriced by the market and where we
believe there is an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. Such opportunities may include event driven investments, anchor orders and CLOs.   
         60   

Table of Contents  

   In the case of event driven investments, we intend to take advantage of dislocations that
arise in the markets due to an impending event and where the market s apparent expectation of value differs substantially from our fundamental analysis. Such events may include a looming debt maturity or default, a merger, spin-off or other
corporate reorganization, an adverse regulatory or legal ruling, or a material contract expiration, any of which may significantly improve or impair a company s financial position. Compared to other investment strategies, event driven investing
depends more heavily on our ability to successfully predict the outcome of an individual event rather than on underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, successful event driven strategies may offer both substantial diversification benefits
and the ability to generate performance in uncertain market environments.      We may also invest in certain opportunities that
are originated and then syndicated by a commercial or investment bank, but where we provide a capital commitment significantly above the average syndicate participant, i.e., an anchor order. In these types of investments, we may receive fees,
preferential pricing or other benefits not available to other lenders in return for our significant capital commitment. Our decision to provide an anchor order to a syndicated transaction is predicated on a rigorous credit analysis, our familiarity
with a particular company, industry or financial sponsor, and the broader investment experiences of FB Advisor and GDFM.      In
addition, our relationship with GSO Capital Partners LP, the parent of GDFM, and one of the largest CLO managers in the world, allows us to opportunistically invest in CLOs. CLOs are a form of securitization where the cash flow from a pooled basket
of syndicated loans is used to support distribution payments made to different tranches of securities. While collectively CLOs represent nearly fifty percent of the broadly syndicated loan universe, investing in individual CLO tranches requires a
high degree of investor sophistication due to their structural complexity and the illiquid nature of their securities.   
   Broadly Syndicated/Other:  Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions and opportunistic
investments, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our
less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we typically receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that
maximizes the levered return potential of our portfolio.      Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior
secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle market U.S. companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of
subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the
 over-the-counter  market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as
additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or
other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private
equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. FB Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as
market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments.   
  The senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we invest generally have stated terms of three to
seven years and subordinated debt investments that we make generally have stated   
         61   

Table of Contents  

terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and seven years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security in
our portfolio. Our debt investments may be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than  Baa3  by Moody s Investors Service,
Inc. or lower than  BBB-  by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services). We also invest in non-rated debt securities.       Revenues
      The principal measure of our financial performance is net increase in net assets resulting from operations, which includes
net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is
the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of
portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain
or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency
for those foreign denominated investments. Net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.   
  We principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate revenues in the
form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with
our investments will be recognized as earned. We may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we hold.       Expenses       Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management
and incentive fees and other expenses under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement and the administration agreement, interest expense from financing facilities and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The
management and incentive fees compensate FB Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. FB Advisor is responsible for compensating our investment sub-adviser.   
  FB Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services,
investor relations and other administrative services. FB Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are
required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FB Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and
dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.   
  Pursuant to the administration agreement, we reimburse FB Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our
administration and operations, including FB Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FB Advisor. We reimburse FB Advisor no
less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FB Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the administration agreement. FB Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such
as total assets, revenues,   
         62   

Table of Contents  

time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of
administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of FB Advisor. Our board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared
to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such
services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of directors compares the total amount paid to FB Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs.   
  We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions. For additional information regarding these expenses, please see our annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      In addition, we have contracted with State Street Bank and
Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FB Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and
corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.       Portfolio
Investment Activity for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and for the Year Ended December 31, 2015    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $662,756. During the same period, we
sold investments for proceeds of $369,844 and received principal repayments of $503,087. As of September 30, 2016, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $3,937,526 (52% in first lien senior secured loans, 16% in second lien
senior secured loans, 4% in senior secured bonds, 11% in subordinated debt, 2% in collateralized securities and 15% in equity/other), consisted of interests in 103 portfolio companies. The portfolio companies that comprised our portfolio as of such
date had an average annual EBITDA of approximately $104.1 million. As of September 30, 2016, the debt investments in our portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 98.2% of par, and our estimated gross portfolio yield (which
represents the expected annualized yield to be generated by us on our investment portfolio based on the composition of our portfolio as of such date), prior to leverage, was 9.2% based upon the amortized cost of our investments. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, our total return based on net asset value was 10.88% and our total return based on market value was 13.23%.      During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $1,647,620. During the same period, we sold investments for proceeds of $607,368 and received principal
repayments of $1,018,152. As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $4,029,371 (54% in first lien senior secured loans, 15% in second lien senior secured loans, 6% in senior secured bonds, 11% in subordinated
debt, 2% in collateralized securities and 12% in equity/other), consisted of interests in 114 portfolio companies. The portfolio companies that comprised our portfolio as of such date had an average annual EBITDA of approximately $113.2 million. As
of December 31, 2015, the debt investments in our portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 98.3% of par, and our estimated gross portfolio yield, prior to leverage, was 9.8% based upon the amortized cost of our investments. For
the year ended December 31, 2015, our total return based on net asset value was 1.63% and our total return based on market value was (0.78)%.      Our estimated gross portfolio yield may be higher than an investor s yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield does not reflect operating expenses that
may be incurred by us. In addition, our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures disclosed above do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common
stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return based on net asset value do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures are subject

   The table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the
percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such industries as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
    As of September 30, 2016, except for JW Aluminum Co., in which we have a second lien secured loan
investment and two equity/other investments, we did not  control  any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, except for ASG Technologies Group, Inc. (formerly Allen Systems Group, Inc.), in
which we have two senior secured loan investments and two equity/other investments, and Fronton Investor Holdings, LLC, in which we have an equity/other investment, we were not an  affiliated person  of any of our portfolio companies, as
defined in the 1940 Act. In general, under the 1940 Act, we would be presumed to  control  a portfolio company if we owned more than 25% of its voting securities or we had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of
such portfolio company, and would be an  affiliated person  of a portfolio company if we owned 5% or more of its voting securities.      Our investment portfolio may contain loans and other unfunded arrangements that are in the form of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, delayed draw credit facilities or other investments, which
require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of September 30, 2016, we had nineteen unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $137,196.
As of December 31, 2015, we had nineteen unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $129,660, one unfunded commitment to purchase up to $467 in shares of preferred stock of Altus Power America Holdings, LLC and one
unfunded equity investment in Sunnova Holdings, LLC with an unfunded commitment of $123. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. For additional details regarding our
unfunded debt investments, see our unaudited consolidated schedule of investments as of September 30, 2016 and audited consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2015.

    Portfolio Asset Quality       In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FB Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FB
Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:       

Investment Rating    
      
     Summary Description     

1   
      
  Investment exceeding expectations and/or capital gain expected.   

2   
      
  Performing investment generally executing in accordance with the portfolio company s business plan full return of principal and interest expected.   

3   
      
  Performing investment requiring closer monitoring.   

4   
      
  Underperforming investment some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment.   

5   
      
  Underperforming investment with expected loss of interest and some principal.   
    The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at
fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
    The amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period
resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in
investment values.       Results of Operations        Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
   Revenues       We generated
investment income of $100,557 and $103,668 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the form of interest and fees earned on senior secured loans (first and second lien), senior secured bonds, subordinated debt
and collateralized securities in our portfolio and dividends and other distributions earned on equity/other investments. Such revenues represent $91,012 and $96,746 of cash income earned as well as $9,545 and $6,922 in non-cash portions relating to
accretion of discount and PIK interest for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are
recognized.

Table of Contents  

   During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $96,343 and
$100,378, respectively, of interest income, which represented 95.8% and 96.8%, respectively, of total investment income. The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments, multiplied by the
weighted average yield of our investments.      During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated
$4,214 and $3,290, respectively, of fee income, which represented 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of total investment income. Fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees and
other non-recurring fees. As such, fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.

September 30, 2015 was primarily due to reduced leverage, prepayments of higher-yielding assets and increased equity holdings during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   
  The increase in fee income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015 was primarily due to increased prepayment activity during the three months ended September 30, 2016.       Expenses    
  Our total expenses were $51,554 and $39,902 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our operating
expenses include base management fees attributed to FB Advisor of $17,872 and $18,852 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our expenses also include administrative services expenses attributed to FB Advisor of
$750 and $900 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      FB Advisor is eligible to receive
incentive fees based on our performance. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on income of $12,250. As of September 30, 2016, a subordinated incentive fee on income of $12,250 was
payable to FB Advisor. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on income of $12,485. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we accrued no capital gains incentive fees based on
the performance of our portfolio. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we reversed capital gains incentive fees of $13,811 based on the performance of our portfolio. See   Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains
Incentive Fee  for additional information about how the incentive fees are calculated.      We recorded interest expense of
$18,283 and $19,352 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our financing arrangements. The fees incurred with our fund administrator, which provides various accounting and administrative
services to us, totaled $243 and $261 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fees for our board of directors were $277 and $232 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     Our other general and administrative expenses totaled $1,879 and $1,631 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and consisted of the following:

   During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the ratio of our expenses to
our average net assets was 2.29% and 1.69%, respectively. Our ratio of expenses to our average net assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $18,283 and $19,352, respectively, related to interest expense and
$12,250 and $(1,326), respectively, related to accruals for incentive fees. Without such expenses, our ratio of expenses to average net assets would have been 0.93% and 0.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Incentive fees and interest expense, among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in amounts outstanding under our financing arrangements and benchmark
interest rates such as LIBOR, among other factors.       Net Investment Income    
  Our net investment income totaled $49,003 ($0.20 per share) and $63,766 ($0.26 per share) for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net investment income can be attributed primarily to the reversal of capital gains incentive fees that reduced expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2015, as well as the reduction in
investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016.       Net Realized Gains or Losses    
  We sold investments and received principal repayments of $99,282 and $191,482, respectively, during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, from which we realized a net gain of $2,337. We also realized a net gain of $86 from settlements on foreign currency during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We sold investments and received principal
repayments of $91,014 and $38,653, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, from which we realized a net loss of $21,246. We also realized a net gain of $266 from settlements on foreign currency during the three months
ended September 30, 2015.       Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Secured Borrowing and Unrealized
Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency       For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the net change in unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on investments and secured borrowing totaled $63,897 and the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency totaled $(954). For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the net change in unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled $(47,628) and the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency totaled $(437). The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was driven by improvement in the high yield markets, a general tightening of credit spreads and an increase in the valuation of the Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., Inc. loans following positive developments in
restructuring efforts concerning these loans.       Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $114,369 ($0.47 per
share) compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $5,279 ($(0.02) per share) during the three months ended September 30, 2015.       Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
   Revenues       We generated
investment income of $313,831 and $360,034 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the form of interest and fees earned on senior secured loans (first and second lien), senior secured bonds, subordinated debt and
collateralized securities in our portfolio and dividends and other distributions earned on equity/other investments. Such revenues represent $284,334 and $336,840 of cash income   
         70   

Table of Contents  

earned as well as $29,497 and $23,194 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows
related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.   
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $291,783 and $320,808, respectively, of interest income, which
represented 93.0% and 89.1%, respectively, of total investment income. The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments, multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments.
     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $21,824 and $33,707, respectively, of fee income,
which represented 7.0% and 9.4%, respectively, of total investment income. Fee income is transaction-based, and typically consists of prepayment fees, structuring fees, amendment and consent fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, fee income is
generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of prepayments and other events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.      The decrease in interest income and fee income in the aggregate during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to reduced
leverage, prepayments of higher-yielding assets and increased equity holdings as a result of restructurings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $224 and $5,519, respectively, of dividend income. The decrease in dividend income was due primarily to a one-time dividend paid in
respect of one of our investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       Expenses    
  Our total expenses were $158,050 and $151,095 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our operating expenses
include base management fees attributed to FB Advisor of $53,258 and $56,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our expenses also include administrative services expenses attributed to FB Advisor of $2,846 and
$2,773 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      FB Advisor is eligible to receive incentive fees
based on our performance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on income of $38,945. As of September 30, 2016, a subordinated incentive fee on income of $12,250 was payable to FB Advisor.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on income of $47,661. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we accrued no capital gains incentive fees based on the performance of our portfolio.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reversed capital gains incentive fees of $18,418 based on the performance of our portfolio. See   Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fee  for additional
information about how the incentive fees are calculated.      We recorded interest expense of $55,241 and $55,699 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our financing arrangements. The fees incurred with our fund administrator, which provides various accounting and administrative services to us, totaled $706 and $822 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fees for our board of directors were $780 and $688 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   Our other general and administrative expenses totaled $6,274 and $4,877 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of the following:       

(1)  
  On April 1, 2015, James F. Volk was appointed as our chief compliance officer. Prior to that date, we had contracted with Vigilant Compliance, LLC to provide the
services of Salvatore Faia as our chief compliance officer. Mr. Volk is employed by FS Investments and will not receive any direct compensation from us in this capacity.     
  Other expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $938 of breakage fees associated with the partial paydown of
the JPM Facility.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the ratio of our expenses to our average net
assets was 7.17% and 6.36%, respectively. Our ratio of expenses to our average net assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $55,241 and $55,699, respectively, related to interest expense and $38,945 and $29,243,
respectively, related to accruals for incentive fees. Without such expenses, our ratio of expenses to average net assets would have been 2.89% and 2.79% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Incentive fees and interest
expense, among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in amounts outstanding under our financing arrangements and benchmark interest rates such as
LIBOR, among other factors. The higher ratio of expenses to average net assets, excluding incentive fees and interest expense, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, can primarily be
attributed to the breakage fees associated with the partial paydown of the JPM Facility and lower average net assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Net Investment Income       Our net investment income totaled $155,781 ($0.64
per share) and $208,939 ($0.86 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net investment income can be attributed to the reversal of capital gains incentive fees that reduced expenses during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, as well as the reduction in investment income and fewer prepayments of investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Net Realized Gains or Losses       We sold investments and received principal
repayments of $369,844 and $503,087, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from which we realized a net loss of $19,090. We also realized a net gain of $264 from settlements on foreign currency during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. We sold investments and received principal repayments of $430,547 and $683,684, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, from which we realized a net loss of $42,135. We also realized a net loss of $631 from
settlements on foreign currency during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

    Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Secured Borrowing and Unrealized
Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net change in unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on investments and secured borrowing totaled $106,740 and the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency totaled $(1,266). For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the net change in unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on investments totaled $(51,945) and the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency totaled $2,625. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was driven by improvement in the high yield markets, a general tightening of credit spreads and an increase in the valuation of the Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., Inc. loans following positive developments in restructuring efforts
concerning these loans.       Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $242,429 ($1.00 per share),
compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $116,853 ($0.48 per share) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources        Overview    
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $113,661 in cash and foreign currency, which we or our wholly-owned financing subsidiaries held in
custodial accounts, and $218,714 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2016, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that
could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2016, we had nineteen unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $137,196. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such
unfunded commitments should the need arise.      We currently generate cash primarily from cash flows from fees, interest and
dividends earned from our investments, as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FB Advisor, but in no
event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See     Financing Arrangements.       Prior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our
investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be
taxed as a RIC.       Financing Arrangements       The following table presents summary information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of September 30, 2016:

  Amount includes borrowing in U.S. dollars and Euros. Euro balance outstanding of  42,963 has been converted to U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of  1.00 to
$1.12 as of September 30, 2016 to reflect total amount outstanding in U.S. dollars.        Our average borrowings
and weighted average interest rate, including the effect of non-usage fees, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,801,822 and 3.82%, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, our weighted average effective interest rate on
borrowings, including the effect of non-usage fees, was 3.95%.      For additional information regarding our financing
arrangements, see Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein.       RIC Status and Distributions    
  We have elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among
other things, make distributions of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, each tax year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of
the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of a tax year or the due date of the tax return for such tax year, including extensions, distributions paid up to twelve months after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax
year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC tax status each tax year. We are also subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise taxes
on certain undistributed income unless we make distributions in a timely manner to our stockholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the
calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses, or  capital gain net income  (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31
of that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October,
November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by
our U.S. stockholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions. If we issue senior securities, we will
be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.   
  Effective January 1, 2015 and subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we intend to
authorize, declare and pay regular cash distributions on a quarterly basis. We will calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each stockholder s distributions will begin
to accrue on the date that shares of our common stock are issued to such stockholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. The
timing and amount of any future distributions to stockholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors.      During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally
is a return of a stockholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our stockholders.
No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 represented a return of capital.   
         74

   We intend to continue to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets
legally available for distribution, except for those stockholders who receive their distributions in the form of shares of our common stock under the DRP. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S.
stockholder.      The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common stock during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       
    On November 2, 2016, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash distribution of
$0.22275 per share, which will be paid on or about January 4, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2016. The timing and amount of any future distributions to stockholders are subject to applicable
legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors.      Pursuant to our DRP, we will reinvest all cash
dividends or distributions declared by our board of directors on behalf of stockholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if our board of directors declares a distribution, then stockholders who have not elected
to  opt out  of the DRP will have their distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock.      With respect to each distribution pursuant to the DRP, we reserve the right to either issue new shares of common stock or purchase shares of common stock in the open market in connection with
implementation of the DRP. Unless in our sole discretion, we otherwise direct the plan administrator, (A) if the per share market price (as defined in the DRP) is equal to or greater than the estimated net asset value per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) of our common stock on the payment date for the distribution, then we will issue shares of common stock at the greater of (i) net asset value per share of common stock or (ii) 95% of the market price; or (B) if the market price
is less than the net asset value per share, then, in our sole discretion, (i) shares of common stock will be purchased in open market transactions for the accounts of participants to the extent practicable, or (ii) we will issue shares of common
stock at net asset value per share. Pursuant to the terms of the DRP, the number of shares of common stock to be issued to a participant will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to a participant by the price
per share at which we issue such shares; provided, however, that shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator will be allocated to a participant based on the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other
charges, of all shares of common stock purchased in the open market.      If a stockholder receives distributions in the form of
common stock pursuant to the DRP, such stockholder generally will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if it elected to receive distributions in cash. If our common stock is trading at or below net asset value, a
stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of cash that they would have received if they had elected to receive the distribution in cash. If our common stock
is trading above net asset value, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of the fair market value of our common stock. The stockholder s basis for
determining gain or loss upon the sale of common stock received in a distribution will be   
         75   

Table of Contents  

equal to the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to the stockholder. Any stock received in a distribution will have a holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following
the day on which the shares of common stock are credited to the stockholder s account.      We may fund our cash
distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds legally available to us, including proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets,
non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets and dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from
available sources to make distributions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all.      The following table reflects the sources of the cash distributions on a tax basis that we have paid on our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Our net investment income on a tax basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $156,642 and $164,390, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had
$152,324 and $158,249, respectively, of undistributed net investment income, and $45,008 and $35,010, respectively, of accumulated capital losses on a tax basis.      See Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to
our tax-basis net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.       Critical Accounting Policies    
  Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of
management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial
statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing
the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due
  
         76   

Table of Contents  

consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of
operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.   
   Valuation of Portfolio Investments       We determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination,
FB Advisor provides our board of directors with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and
forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.      Accounting Standards Codification Topic
820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in
interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level
2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no
market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.      With respect to investments for which
market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:       

our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FB Advisor s management team reviewing and documenting valuations of each portfolio company or
investment, which valuations may be obtained from an independent third-party valuation service, if applicable;          

FB Advisor s management team then provides the valuation committee with the preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment;

preliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;      

our valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FB Advisor s management team, together with our independent third-party valuation
services, if applicable, supplement the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;          

following its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of directors approve our fair valuations; and      

our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various
statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FB Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.      
  Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements
refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of directors may use any approved
independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of directors is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information
obtained from FB Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of directors deems to be reliable in   
         77

determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FB Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of
directors may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.      Valuation of fixed income investments, such as
loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments
without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair
market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.      For convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt
may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.      Our equity
interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of directors, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income,
revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to
EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.      FB Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples
discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FB Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation
services and our board of directors may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk
and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of directors, in consultation with FB Advisor s management team and any approved independent third-party valuation services,
if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio
securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.      When we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the
debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of directors subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.   
  The fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of directors. Our board of directors is solely responsible
for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of directors has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our
valuation policy to FB Advisor s management team, and has authorized FB Advisor s management team to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of directors. The valuation committee
is responsible for overseeing FB Advisor s implementation of the valuation process.      Our investments as of
September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Sixty-two senior secured loan investments, three senior secured bond investments and fifteen subordinated debt investments, for which broker
quotes were not available, were valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the   
         78

borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features and other relevant terms of the debt. Except as
described below, all of our equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well
as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. Two equity investments, which were traded on an active public market, were valued at their respective
closing price as of September 30, 2016. Except as described above, we valued our other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by
independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services.      Our investments as of December 31,
2015 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Sixty senior secured loan investments, three senior secured bond investments, fourteen subordinated debt investments and one collateralized security, for which
broker quotes were not available, were valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest
rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features and other relevant terms of the debt. Except as described below, all of our equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of
such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation
value. One equity investment, which was traded on an active public market, was valued at its closing price as of December 31, 2015. Two senior secured loan investments, which were newly issued and purchased near December 31, 2015, were
valued at cost as our board of directors determined that the cost of each such investment was the best indication of its fair value. Except as described above, we valued our other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask
prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services.      We periodically benchmark the bid and ask prices we receive from the third-party pricing services and/or dealers, as applicable, against the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our investments.
Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of our management in purchasing and selling these investments, we believe that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value. However, because of the private nature of this
marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), we believe that these valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. We may also use other methods, including the use of an independent valuation firm,
to determine fair value for securities for which we cannot obtain prevailing bid and ask prices through third-party pricing services or independent dealers, or where our board of directors otherwise determines that the use of such other methods is
appropriate. We periodically benchmark the valuations provided by the independent valuation firm against the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our investments. The valuation committee and board of directors reviewed and approved the
valuation determinations made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with our valuation policy.       Revenue Recognition
      Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent
that we expect to collect such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend date. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income. Our policy is to
place investments on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited
to, the delinquency status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the overall financial condition of the underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances
relevant to the investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the interest income will be   
         79

written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest.
Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are likely to remain current based on our judgment.      Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of
a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans
and securities as fee income when we receive such amounts.       Net Realized Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or
Depreciation and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency       Gains or losses on the sale of investments
are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized
appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of
previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. Net change in unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency reflects the change in the value of receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact
of foreign currency fluctuations.      We follow the guidance in ASC Topic 860 when accounting for loan participations and other
partial loan sales. This guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a participating interest, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan
sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the participation or other partial loan sale meets the definition. Secured
borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.       Capital Gains Incentive
Fee       Pursuant to the terms of each of the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014
investment advisory agreement and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of such agreement). Such fee will equal
20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a
cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.
     While none of the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory
agreement or the July 2014 investment advisory agreement include or contemplate the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an AICPA Technical Practice Aid for investment
companies, commencing during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we changed our methodology for accruing for this incentive fee to include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued
capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to FB Advisor if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though FB Advisor is not entitled to an incentive
fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.

    Subordinated Income Incentive Fee    
  Pursuant to the terms of each of the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory
agreement and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, FB Advisor may also be entitled to receive a subordinated incentive fee on income. The subordinated incentive fee on income under the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services
agreement, which was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equaled 20.0% of our  pre-incentive fee net investment income  for the immediately preceding quarter and was subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on
adjusted capital, as defined in the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, equal to 2.0% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 8.0%. As a result, FB Advisor did not earn this incentive fee for any quarter
until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeded the hurdle rate of 2.0%. Once our pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeded the hurdle rate, FB Advisor was entitled to a  catch-up  fee
equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equaled 2.5%, or 10.0% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FB Advisor received
20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income. Under the April 2014 investment advisory agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income was calculated in the same manner, except that the hurdle rate used to compute the subordinated incentive
fee on income was based on the value of our net assets rather than adjusted capital.      Under the July 2014 investment advisory
agreement, the hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets, was reduced from 2.0% to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. As a result, FB Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter
until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once our pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FB Advisor will be entitled to a  catch-up  fee
equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375%, or 9.375% annually, of net assets. Thereafter, FB Advisor will be
entitled to receive 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income.      Under both the April 2014 investment advisory agreement
and the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except
to the extent that 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the eleven preceding calendar
quarters. Accordingly, any subordinated incentive fee on income that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the
applicable quarterly hurdle rate, subject to the  catch-up  provision, and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the
cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the eleven preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the  cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations  is the sum of our pre-incentive fee net investment
income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation for the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters. There will be no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter
and, accordingly, there will be no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the applicable quarterly hurdle rate and there will be no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the applicable quarterly hurdle rate.
      Uncertainty in Income Taxes       We evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be
taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is
 more likely than not  to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur any interest or penalties.

    Contractual Obligations       We have entered into agreements with FB Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the July 2014 investment advisory
agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee based on the average value of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. FB Advisor, and to the extent it is required to provide such services, GDFM, are
reimbursed for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein and   Related Party Transactions Compensation of the Investment Adviser  for a
discussion of these agreements and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at September 30, 2016 is as follows:   

(1)  
  At September 30, 2016, $218,714 remained unused under the ING credit facility. Amounts outstanding under the ING credit facility will mature, and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on April 3, 2018. Amount includes borrowing in U.S. dollars and Euros. Euro balance outstanding of  42,963 has been converted to U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of  1.00 to $1.12 as
of September 30, 2016 to reflect total amount outstanding in U.S. dollars.         

(2)  
  At September 30, 2016, no amounts remained unused under the JPM Facility. Race Street will, on a quarterly basis, repurchase the Class A Notes sold to JPM
under the JPM Facility and subsequently resell such Class A Notes to JPM. As of September 30, 2016, the final repurchase transaction was scheduled to occur no later than April 15, 2017.     

(3)  
  All amounts will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on July 15, 2019.     

(4)  
  All amounts will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on January 15, 2020.     

(5)  
  All amounts will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on May 15, 2022.     

(6)  
  All amounts will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on July 29, 2022.     
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.       Related Party Transactions        Compensation of the Investment Adviser    
  Pursuant to the 2008 investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the April 2014 investment advisory agreement and the July
2014 investment advisory agreement, FB Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee based on the average value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance.

The investment sub-advisory agreement provides that GDFM will receive 50% of all management and incentive fees payable to FB Advisor under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement with respect
to each year. Pursuant to the administration agreement, we also reimburse FB Advisor and GDFM for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FB Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation
and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FB Advisor.   
  The following table describes the fees and expenses we accrued under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement and the administration
agreement, as applicable, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       

(2)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reversed capital gains incentive fees of $18,418 based on the performance of our portfolio, all of which was based
on unrealized gains and none of which is payable by us unless and until those gains are actually realized. We paid FB Advisor no capital gains incentive fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, no capital
gains incentive fees were accrued.         
     
    See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for
additional information regarding our agreements with FB Advisor and our other related party transactions and relationships, including our potential conflicts of interest, exemptive relief order and our trademark license agreement with FS
Investments.

Item 3.  Quantitative   
   and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.         We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, 65.2% of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates, 20.4%
paid fixed interest rates, 3.7% were income producing equity or other investments, and the remaining 10.7% consisted of non-income producing equity or other investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to
higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our
interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold
would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to FB Advisor
with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income.      Pursuant to the terms of the ING credit facility and
secured borrowing arrangement, we borrow at a floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate. Under the terms of the agreements governing the terms of the JPM Facility, Race Street pays interest to JPM at a fixed rate. Under the indenture
governing the 4.000% notes, the 4.250% notes and the 4.750% notes, we pay interest to the holders of such notes at a fixed rate. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our
subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or our subsidiaries have such debt outstanding, or financing
arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments.      The following table shows the effect over a twelve month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income, assuming no changes in the composition of our
investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangements in effect as of September 30, 2016 (dollar amounts are presented in thousands):   

(1)  
  Assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months.     
  We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate
risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from
changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not engage in interest rate
hedging activities.      In addition, we may have risk regarding portfolio valuation. See  Item 2. Management s

      Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.    
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.      Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our
disclosure obligations.       Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
