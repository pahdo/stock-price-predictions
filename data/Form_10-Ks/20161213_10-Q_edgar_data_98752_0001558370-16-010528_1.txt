NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE   1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The consolidated condensed balance sheet as of April 30, 2016, which has been derived from the audited financial statements of Torotel, Inc. ("Torotel"), is accompanied by the unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements, which reflect the normal recurring adjustments that in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly Torotel s consolidated financial position at October 31, 2016, and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  

The unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although management believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. The financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with Torotel s consolidated financial statements and related notes filed on Torotel's Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 as filed with the SEC on June 30, 2016. 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, and will provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The provisions of this new guidance are effective as of the beginning of Torotel s first fiscal quarter of 2019. Torotel is currently evaluating the transition method to be used and the impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 requires expanded disclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. Torotel is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE   2   NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Torotel conducts business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, Torotel Products, Inc. ( Torotel Products ), and until early in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 also operated another wholly owned subsidiary, Electronika, Inc. ( Electronika ) that licensed, marketed, and sold ballast transformers to the airline industry.  Electronika was dissolved and its affairs wound up as of February 8, 2016. As a result of the dissolution of Electronika, Torotel no longer sells ballast transformers. Torotel specializes in the custom design and manufacture of a wide variety of precision magnetic components, consisting of transformers, inductors, reactors, chokes, toroidal coils, high voltage transformers, dry-type transformers and electro-mechanical assemblies, for use in commercial, industrial and military electronics.

NOTE   3 INVENTORIES 

The following table summarizes the components of inventories: 

NOTE   4 FINANCING AGREEMENTS 

Torotel Products has a financing agreement (the  financing agreement ) with Commerce Bank, N.A. (the  Bank ).  The financing agreement provides for a revolving line of credit, a guidance line of credit, and a real estate term loan. Torotel serves as an additional guarantor to all notes described below. A summary of the notes outstanding under the financing agreement is provided below: 

The revolving line of credit, to be used for working capital purposes, is renewable annually.  The associated interest rate is equal to the greater of the floating Commerce Bank Prime Rate (currently 3.5%) or a floor of 4% (as listed above).  Monthly repayments of interest only are required with the principal due at maturity.  The maximum borrowing of this line of credit is $500,000.  This revolving line of credit is cross collateralized and cross defaulted with all other facilities of Torotel Products with the Bank and is secured by a first lien on all business assets of Torotel Products.  

The mortgage note requires monthly payments consisting of both interest and principal.  This obligation is cross collateralized and cross defaulted with all other credit facilities and arrangements of Torotel Products with the Bank and is secured by a first real estate mortgage on the property located at 620 North Lindenwood Drive in Olathe, Kansas. This loan was refinanced on February 21, 2014 with a principal amount of $542,000 at that date.  

The equipment note is a guidance line of credit to be used for equipment purchases. Monthly repayments consisting of both interest and principal are required. This note is cross collateralized and cross defaulted with all other credit facilities and arrangements of Torotel Products with the Bank and is secured by a purchase money security interest in the assets purchased as well as a first lien on all business assets of Torotel Products.  The maximum borrowing of this line of credit is $500,000. 

Torotel is also required to comply with specified financial covenants in its guaranty of the financing agreement. As of October 31, 2016, Torotel was in compliance with these covenants.

Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit 

Under the terms of a lease amendment of its manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas (see Note 11), Torotel provided the landlord an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of $350,000 as an additional security deposit. This letter of credit will automatically reduce in accordance with the below schedule if not drawn upon: 

NOTE   5 INCOME TAXES 

As of October 31, 2016, the federal tax returns for the fiscal years ended 2014 through 2016 are open to audit until the statute of limitations closes for the years in which our net operating losses are utilized. We would recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as well as interest received from favorable tax settlements within income tax expense.   As of October 31, 2016, we recorded no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. We expect no significant change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit, accrued interest or penalties within the next twelve months. 

NOTE   6 RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENTS 

Restricted Stock Agreements, and stock awards thereunder, are authorized by the Compensation and Nominating Committee (the "Committee") and the Board of Directors of Torotel (the "Board"). The terms of the Restricted Stock Agreements afford the grantees all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the award shares, including the right to vote such shares and to receive dividends and other distributions payable with respect to such shares since the date of award. Under the terms of each agreement, the non-vested shares are restricted as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances. The Restricted Stock Agreements further provide, subject to certain conditions, that if prior to all of the restricted shares having vested, we undergo a change in control, then all of the restricted shares shall be vested and no longer subject to restrictions under the Restricted Stock Agreements. The restricted shares are treated as non-vested stock; accordingly, the fair value of the restricted stock at the date of award is offset against capital in excess of par value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under stockholders' equity. 

2013 Restricted Stock Grants 

On June 17, 2013, we entered into Restricted Stock Agreements with three key employees pursuant to the Company s Stock Award Plan (the  Plan ). The aggregate amount of the restricted stock awards was 400,000 shares of common stock. These shares were transferred from treasury shares. Based on the market price of $0.50 for our common stock as of June 17, 2013, the fair value of the restricted stock at the date of award was $200,000. The shares issued pursuant to the Restricted Stock Agreements on June 17, 2013 are restricted and may not be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of until the restrictions lapse. The restrictions will lapse on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant if during the five year restriction period, (1) Torotel's cumulative annual growth in earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") is at least 10% and (2) Torotel's average return on capital employed ("ROCE") is at least 25%. The restrictions will also lapse, if prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, (1) the grantee's employment with Torotel is terminated by reason of disability, (2) the grantee dies, or (3) the Committee, in its sole discretion, terminates the restrictions. If the restrictions on such shares have not lapsed by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, such shares will be forfeited to Torotel.  Stock compensation cost net of an appropriate pre-vesting forfeiture rate is recorded per quarter for the remainder of the vesting period provided the financial performance metrics as outlined in the Stock Award Plan are likely to be attained. However,

Table of Contents  

due to updated projections developed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, the likelihood of achieving the financial performance metrics as outlined in the Restricted Stock Agreements  were classified as not probable. As a result, we stopped amortizing the stock compensation cost associated with the restricted stock awarded on July 17, 2013 and recovered the previously amortized stock compensation cost of $88,000 in the third quarter ended January 31, 2016. The 350,000 shares associated with the restricted stock awards dated June 17, 2013, were reverted to treasury shares during the fiscal year 2017. 

2016 Restricted Stock Grants 

On September 21, 2016, we entered into Restricted Stock Agreements ( 2016 Agreements ) with three key employees for the grant of an aggregate total of 730,000 restricted shares of the Company's common stock (the  Shares ).  The shares were granted, and the 2016 Agreements were entered into, pursuant to the Plan.  The award of the shares was authorized by both the Committee and the Board of Directors as a whole on September 19, 2016.   Except for the number of shares granted to each recipient, the terms of each Agreement are identical.   

The Shares were granted subject to restrictions that prohibit them from being sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of until the restrictions lapse.  The restrictions will lapse on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant if during the five year restriction period, (1) the Company's cumulative annual growth in revenue is at least 10%, and (2) the average economic value added as a percentage of revenue is at least 2%.  The economic value added, which attepts to capture the true economic profit, will be calculated as the operating profit less the cost of capital with adjustments made for taxes. The restrictions will also lapse, if prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, (1) the grantee's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of disability, (2) the grantee dies, or (3) the Committee, in its sole discretion, terminates the restrictions.  If the restrictions on the Shares have not lapsed by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the Shares will be forfeited to the Company. 

Stock Compensation Costs and Restricted Stock Activity 

Total stock compensation cost for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $11,000 and $17,000, respectively.  

Restricted stock activity for each three month period through October 31 is summarized as follows: 

NOTE   7 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 

The shares of common stock outstanding as of October 31 of each year are summarized as follows:

NOTE   8 EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines net income per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Per share amounts are computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during each period. 

The basic earnings per common share were computed as follows: 

ASC 260, Earnings per Share, provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are considered to be participating securities and must be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.  Diluted earnings per share is not presented as we do not have any shares considered incremental and dilutive. 

NOTE 9 CUSTOMER DEPOSITS   

For certain customers, we collect payment at the time the order is placed.  These deposits are classified as a liability and will be recognized as revenue at the time of shipment in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.  As of October 31, 2016 we had approximately $18,000 in customer deposits related to these arrangements. 

NOTE 10   CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK   

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable.  We grant unsecured credit to most of our customers.  We do not believe that we are exposed to any extraordinary credit risk as a result of this policy.  At various times, and at October 31, 2016, cash balances exceeded federally insured limits. However, we have incurred no losses in the cash accounts and we do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to our cash.

NOTE 11   OPERATING LEASE 

On October 31, 2016, Torotel entered into a Second Amendment ( Amendment ) to the lease for its manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. The Amendment will be effective January 1, 2017, and serves to extend the lease term through December 31, 2026 and expand the leased space from approximately 14,137 square feet to approximately 72,388 square feet. The Amendment provides that the monthly base rate in the first two years of the extended term will be $26,844, escalating thereafter. The Amendment required Torotel to increase its security deposit from $12,750 to $55,000 and provide a letter of credit as additional security. Additionally, the Amendment addresses other terms and conditions by which Torotel may continue to lease the facility or terminate the lease, and provides Torotel two separate options to extend the lease term for additional five year periods. 

Future minimum lease payments on this operating lease are as follows:

decreased demand for our products;     

delays in developing new products;     

markets for new products and the cost of developing new markets;     

expected orders that do not occur;     

our ability to adequately protect and safeguard our network infrastructure from cyber security vulnerabilities;     

loss of key customers;     

our ability to satisfy our debt covenant requirements;     

our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the amount of our deferred tax assets;     

the impact of competition and price erosion as well as supply and manufacturing constraints; and     

other risks and uncertainties.     

In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information contained in this report will prove accurate, and actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made herein.

Item 2  .       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview   

Torotel, Inc. ("Torotel") conducts business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, Torotel Products, Inc. ("Torotel Products"), and through approximately February 2, 2016, also operated another wholly owned subsidiary, Electronika, Inc. ("Electronika"). Electronika was dissolved and its affairs wound up as of February 8, 2016. Because it conducted business during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, Electronika s results of operations are included in Torotel s consolidated statement of operations for the comparative quarter ended October 31, 2015. As a result of the dissolution of Electronika, Torotel no longer sells ballast transformers. 

Torotel Products is engaged in the custom design and manufacture of a wide variety of precision magnetic components consisting of transformers, inductors, reactors, chokes, toroidal coils, high voltage transformers, dry-type transformers and electro-mechanical assemblies for use in military, commercial aerospace and industrial electronic applications. These products are used to modify and control electrical voltages and currents in electronic devices. Torotel Products sells these products to original equipment manufacturers, which use them in applications such as: 

aircraft navigational equipment;     

digital control devices;     

airport runway lighting devices;      

medical equipment;     

avionics systems;     

radar systems;     

down-hole drilling;      

conventional missile guidance systems; and     

other commercial aerospace and defense applications.     

Torotel Products markets its components primarily through an internal sales force and independent manufacturers  representatives paid on a commission basis.  These commissions are earned when a product is sold and/or shipped to a customer within the representative s assigned territory.  Torotel Products also utilizes its engineering department in its direct sales efforts for the purpose of expanding its reach into new markets and/or customers. 

The industry mix of the customers that accounted for Torotel Products  net sales for the first six months of the fiscal year ending April 30, 2017 ( fiscal year 2017 ) was 50% defense, 43% commercial aerospace, and 7% industrial compared to 53% defense, 43% commercial aerospace, and 4% industrial for the same period in the fiscal year ending April 30, 2016 ( fiscal year 2016 ).  Also, approximately 91% of Torotel Products  sales during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 have been derived from domestic customers. 

Torotel Products is an approved source for magnetic components used in numerous military and commercial aerospace systems, which means Torotel Products is automatically solicited for any procurement needs for such applications.  The magnetic components manufactured by Torotel Products are sold primarily in the United States, and most sales are awarded on a competitive bid basis.  The markets in which Torotel Products competes are highly competitive.  A substantial number of companies sell components of the type manufactured and sold by Torotel Products.  In addition, Torotel Products sells to a number of customers who have the capability of manufacturing their own electronic components.  The principal methods of competition for electronic products in the markets served by Torotel Products include, among other factors, price, on-time delivery performance, lead times, customized product engineering and technical support, marketing capabilities, quality assurance, manufacturing efficiency, and existing relationships with customers  engineers.  While we believe magnetic components are generally not susceptible to rapid technological change, Torotel Products  sales, which do not represent a significant share of the industry s market, are susceptible to decline given the competitive nature of the market.

Business and Industry Considerations   

Defense Markets 

During the first six months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the amount of consolidated revenues derived from contracts with prime contractors of the U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ) was approximately   50%   and 53% respectively.   As a result, our financial results in any period could be impacted substantially by spending cuts or increases in the DoD budget and the funds appropriated for certain military programs. 

Despite increased uncertainty associated with the DoD budget, we believe our overall defense business outlook remains favorable due to the present demand for the potted coil assembly and other existing orders from major defense contractors. As of October 31,  2016, our consolidated order backlog for the defense market was nearly $2.8 million, which included $1.2 million for the potted coil assembly. 

Commercial Aerospace and Industrial Markets 

We provide magnetic components and electro-mechanical assemblies for a variety of applications in the commercial aerospace and industrial markets. The primary demand drivers for these markets include commercial aircraft orders, oil and gas drilling exploration activity, and general economic growth. While domestic economic growth remains positive, the above demand drivers could be impacted by short-term changes in the economy such as spikes or declines in the price of oil, war, terrorism, or changes in regulation. Other threats to our anticipated positive near-term and long-term market outlook include delays on the development and production of new commercial aircraft and competition from international suppliers. As of October 31,  2016, our consolidated order backlog for the aerospace and industrial markets was $0.8 million. However, a significant portion of our business has been converted to long-term agreements. Approximately $1.3 million of revenue in the quarter ended October 31, 2016 was not on our backlog at July 31, 2016. 

Business Outlook 

Our non-headcoil backlog as of October 31, 2016 as compared to October 31, 2015 decreased from $5.1 million to $2.4 million, a 53% decrease. This was due primarily to the shift in volume to long-term agreements. We anticipate that net sales for the 2017 fiscal year will be comparable with the net sales for the 2016 fiscal year. While the first half of the year has experienced lower sales volumes, we believe that due to timing of newer programs that revenue could increase during the second half of the 2017 fiscal year. 

Consolidated Results of Operations   

The following management comments regarding Torotel s results of operations and outlook should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 

This discussion and analysis of the results of operations include the operations of Torotel and its subsidiary Torotel Products as of October 31, 2016. Until its dissolution in February of 2016, Electronika engaged in minimal business activities during fiscal year 2016. In the first six months of fiscal year 2016 Electronika s operations did not result in any net sales or earnings from operations for Torotel.

Net Sales 

* During the 2016 fiscal year periods Torotel achieved $1,000 in net sales through Electronika s operations. These amounts are included in the total consolidated net sales presented in Torotel s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period ended October 31, 2015; however, Electronika s net sales for the 2016 fiscal year periods are not reflected in the table above. 

Consolidated net sales in the three and six months ended October 31,  2016 decreased 7% or $290,000 and 3% or $253,000, respectively compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2015.  Torotel Products' net sales decreased during the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 versus the comparable period in fiscal year 2016 primarily because of lower demand in magnetics during the periods ended October 31,  2016.    We anticipate that net sales for the 2017 fiscal year will be comparable with the net sales for the 2016 fiscal year. While the first half of the year has experienced lower sales volumes, we believe that due to timing of newer programs that revenue could increase during the second half of the 2017 fiscal year. 

Gross Profit 

Consolidated gross profit decreased by 22% or $327,000 and 3% or $81,000, respectively in the three and six months ended October 31,  2016 compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2015. The gross profit of Torotel Products decreased during the periods ended October 31, 2016 compared to the comparable periods in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the product mix sold by Torotel Products.  

Operating Expenses 

Engineering expenses increased nearly 28%, or $52,000 and 19% or $70,000, respectively in the three and six months ended October 31,  2016 compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2015.  The increases primarily resulted from an increase in engineering headcount and training expenses.  

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21% or $187,000 and 16% or $304,000, respectively in the three and six months ended October 31,  2016 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase in

Table of Contents  

the three-month period resulted from the following: a $71,000 increase in professional and accounting fees; a $62,000 increase in salaries due to increased headcount and compensation increases; and a $42,000 increase in recruiting and employee relations expenses related to the increased headcount. The increase in the six-month period resulted from a $190,000 increase in professional and accounting fees; a $105,000 increase in salaries due to increased headcount and compensation increases; and an $81,000 increase in recruiting and employee relations expenses related to the increased headcount. These increases were offset partially by a $56,000 decrease in information technology expenses. 

Earnings from Operations 

For the reasons discussed under each of the Net Sales, Gross Profit, and Operating Expenses headings above, consolidated earnings from operations decreased by 146%, or $566,000 and 92%, or $455,000 for the three and six months ended October 31,  2016 when compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2015.  

Other Earnings Items 

We anticipate that our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will be 39.2%.  The effective income tax rate was 39.2% for the same period in the prior year. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Financial Condition and Liquidity   

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. The following table highlights the sources of liquidity available to us as of October 31,  2016 and 2015, and compares net cash provided by (used in) operating activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended October 31, 2015. 

Operating Activities 

The $73,000 change in net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016 versus the comparable period of the 2016 fiscal year is primarily due to a decrease in trade receivables.

Investing Activities 

The change of $4,000 in net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the comparable period of the 2016 fiscal year was due to slightly lower capital expenditures in the first six months of fiscal year 2017 as compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2016. Capital expenditures during each of the six months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015 were primarily related to purchases of new production equipment and machinery. We do expect capital expenditure spending to continue during the remainder of fiscal year 2017 which is consistent with the anticipated needs of our business. 

Financing Activities 

We have used cash generated by operating activities as the primary source for the repayment of our debt. The change of $35,000 for the six month period of fiscal year 2017 from the comparable period in fiscal year 2016 is due to repayment of our debt in fiscal year 2017.  

Capital Resources 

We believe the projected cash flow from operations, combined with existing cash balances, will be sufficient to meet funding requirements for the foreseeable future.  Torotel has a $500,000 bank line of credit available, which we anticipate could be utilized to help fund any working capital requirements. As of October 31,  2016, the entire credit line was available and we have not utilized this credit line in fiscal year 2017. 

We believe that inflation will have only a minimal effect on future operations since such effects should be offset by sales price increases, which are not expected to have a significant effect upon demand. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates in Item 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on June 30, 2016. We have made no significant change in our critical accounting policies since April 30, 2016.

Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Torotel s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There were no significant changes in Torotel s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that in management s estimates have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Torotel s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
