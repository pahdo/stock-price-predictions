Forward Looking Statements.  The Company and its
representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking
statements with respect to the Company's annual or long-term goals,
including statements contained in its filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and in its reports to stockholders.

		The words or phrases "will likely result," "will be,"
"will," "are expected to," "will continue to," "is anticipated,"
"estimate," "project" or similar expressions identify "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.

PART I

Item 1.  Business.

		General.  Incorporated in 1954, Scientific Industries,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (which along with its subsidiaries, the
"Company") is engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of
standard benchtop laboratory equipment ("Benchtop Laboratory Equipment"),
customized catalyst research instruments ("Catalyst Research Instruments"),
under its wholly-owned subsidiary, Altamira Instruments, Inc., ("Altamira")
and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc.,
("SBI"), the design and development of bioprocessing systems and products
("Bioprocessing Systems").   The Company's products are used primarily
for research purposes by universities, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies,
national laboratories, medical device manufacturers, petrochemical companies
and other industries performing laboratory-scale research.

		Operating Segments.  The Company views its operations as
three segments: the manufacture and marketing of standard Benchtop Laboratory
Equipment for research in university, pharmacy and industrial laboratories
sold primarily through laboratory equipment distributors and online; the
manufacture and marketing of custom-made Catalyst Research Instruments for
universities, government laboratories, and chemical and petrochemical
companies; and the development and sublicensing of bioprocessing systems
and products for research in university and industrial laboratories.
For certain financial information regarding the Company's operating
segments, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included
under Item 8.

Products.

		Benchtop Laboratory Equipment.   The Company's Benchtop
Laboratory Equipment products consist of mixers and shakers, rotators/
rockers, refrigerated and shaking incubators, and magnetic stirrers sold
under the "Genie(TM)" brand, and pharmacy and laboratory balances, force
gauges, and moisture analyzers under the "Torbal(TM)" brand.  Sales of
the Company's principal product, the Vortex-Genie(R) 2 Mixer, excluding
accessories, represented approximately 28% and 34% of the Company's
total net revenues for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016
("fiscal 2016") and June 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015"), and 50% of the
segment's sales for both fiscal years.

		The vortex mixer is used to mix the contents of test tubes,
beakers, and other various containers by placing such containers on a
rotating cup or other attachments which cause the contents to be mixed
at varying speeds.

		The Company's additional mixers and shakers include a
high speed touch mixer; a mixer with an integral timer, a patented cell
disruptor; microplate mixers, two vortex mixers incorporating digital
control and display; a large capacity multi-vessel vortex mixer and
orbital shakers.

4

The Company also offers various benchtop multi-purpose
rotators and rockers, designed to rotate and rock a wide variety of
containers, and a refrigerated incubator and an incubator shaker, both of
which are multi-functional benchtop environmental chambers designed to
perform various shaking and stirring functions under controlled
environmental conditions.

		Its line of magnetic stirrers include a patented high/low
programmable magnetic stirrer;  a four-place high/low programmable
magnetic stirrer; a large volume magnetic stirrer available in analog and
digital versions; and a four-place general purpose stirrer also available
in analog and digital versions.

		The Company's Torbal brand line of products include
pharmacy, laboratory, and industrial digital scales, mechanical balances,
 moisture analyzers, and force gauges resulting from an acquisition in
February 2014.

		Catalyst Research Instruments.  The Catalyst Research
Instrument products are offered through the Company's subsidiary,
Altamira.  Its flagship product is the AMI-300(TM), which is used to
perform traditional catalyst characterization experiments on an
unattended basis.  The product also features a stand-alone personal
computer to control the instrument and incorporates proprietary
LabVIEW(R)-based software.  The Company's AMI-300 Catalyst
Characterization Instrument incorporates a sophisticated data
handling package and is designed to perform dynamic temperature-
programmed catalyst characterization experiments.  All AMI
model instruments are designed or adapted to a customer's
individual requirements.

		Its other Catalyst Research Instrument products
include reactor systems, high throughput systems and micro-activity
reactors, including the Company's BenchCAT(TM) custom reactor systems.
They are available with single and multiple reactor paths and with
reactor temperatures up to 1200 degrees Celsius.  The systems feature
multiple gas flows, are available in gas and gas/liquid configurations,
and feature one or more stand-alone personal computers with the
LabVIEW(R)-based control software.

		Bioprocessing Systems.  The Company, through SBI, is
engaged in the design and development of bioprocessing products which
the Company began marketing during fiscal 2016, principally coaster
systems using disposable sensors for vessels with volumes ranging
from 250 milliliter to five liters.  The Company expects to commence
production of these products in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.
In addition, the Company sublicenses the patents and technology it
holds relating to bioprocessing systems exclusively under a license
with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, ("UMBC"), for which
it receives royalties.

		Product Development.  The Company designs and develops
substantially all of its products.  Company personnel formulate plans
and concepts for new products and improvements or modifications of
existing products.  The Company engages outside consultants to augment
its capabilities in areas such as industrial and electronics design.

		Major Customers.  Sales, principally of the Vortex-
Genie 2 Mixer, to two customers, represented for fiscal 2016 and fiscal
2015, 9% and 12% of total revenues, respectively, and 15% and 17% of
Benchtop Laboratory Equipment product sales, respectively.  Sales of
Catalyst Research Instrument products are generally pursuant to a few
large orders amounting on average to over $100,000 to a limited number
of customers.  In fiscal 2016, sales to one customer accounted for
61% of the segment's sales (26% of total revenues).  In fiscal 2015,
sales to a different customer accounted for 12% of the segment's sales
(4% of total revenues).

		Marketing.

		Benchtop Laboratory Equipment.  The Company's Benchtop
Laboratory Equipment products sold under the "Genie" brand are
generally distributed and marketed through an established network of
domestic and overseas laboratory equipment distributors, who sell the
Company's products through printed catalogs, websites and sales force.
The Company's "Torbal" brand products are primarily

5

marketed and sold online , and primarily on a direct basis, with only a
few distributors.  The Company also markets products through attendance
at industry trade shows, trade publication advertising, brochures and
catalogs, the Company's websites, one sales manager and one director of
marketing in the U.S., and a consultant in Europe.

		In general, due to the reliance on sales through the
catalog distribution system, it takes two to three years for a new
benchtop laboratory equipment product to begin generating meaningful
sales.

		Catalyst Research Instruments.  The Company's Catalyst
Research Instrument products are sold directly worldwide to universities,
government laboratories, and chemical and petrochemical companies
through its sales personnel and independent representatives engaged
on a commission basis.  Its marketing efforts include attendance at
various trade shows, Altamira's website, outside sales representatives,
and printed materials.

		Bioprocessing Systems.  The Company's Bioprocessing
Systems products, are currently under development and the Company
expects to begin production during the fiscal year ending June 30,
2017, although no assurances can be given, and will be offered both
directly and through distribution worldwide to university, industrial,
and government laboratories.  The Company began marketing the products
during fiscal 2016 via its new website, trade shows, and online marketing.

		Assembly and Production.  The Company has an operating
facility in Bohemia, New York at which its Benchtop Laboratory Equipment
operations are conducted and one in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at which its
Catalyst Research Instruments operations are conducted. The Company also
has a small sales and marketing office in Oradell, New Jersey related to its
Torbal division. The Company's production operations principally involve
assembly of components supplied by various domestic and international
independent suppliers.  The Company has not commenced production of
bioprocessing products, but anticipates that its current facilities will
be adequate for such purpose.

		Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses.

		The Company holds several United States patents relating
to its products, including a patent which expires in February 2018 on
the Roto-Shake Genie(R); a patent which expires in November 2022 on the
MagStir Genie(R), MultiMagStir Genie(R), and Enviro-Genie(R), and a
patent which expires in January 2029 on a biocompatible bag with
integral sensors.  The Company has several patent applications pending.
The Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its
operations following the expiration of the patents.

		The Company has various proprietary trademarks, including
AMI(TM), BenchCAT(TM), Biocoaster(TM), BioGenie(R), Cellphase(R),
Cellstation(R), Disruptor Beads(TM), Disruptor Genie(R), Enviro-Genie(R),
Genie(TM), Incubator Genie(TM), MagStir Genie(R),  MegaMag Genie(R),
MicroPlate Genie(R), MultiMagStir Genie(R), Multi-MicroPlate Genie(R),
Orbital-Genie(R), QuadMag Genie(R), Rotator Genie(R), SBI(R), Roto-Shake
Genie(R), Torbal(R), TurboMix(TM), and Vortex-Genie(R), each of which
it considers important to the success of the related product.  The
Company also has several trademark applications pending.  No representation
can be made that any application will be granted or as to the protection
that any existing or future trademark may provide.

		The Company has several licensing agreements for
technology and patents used in the Company's business, including an
exclusive license from UMBC with respect to rights and know-how under
a patent held by UMBC related to disposable sensor technology, which
the Company further sublicenses on an exclusive basis to a German
company, and non-exclusive rights held by the Company as it relates to
the use of the technology with vessels of sizes ranging from 250
milliliters to 5 liters.  The Company also holds a license to certain
technology related to its patent for the Roto-Shake Genie.  Total
license fees paid by the Company under all its licenses for fiscal
2016 and fiscal 2015 amounted to $106,600 and $124,100, respectively.

6

Foreign Sales.  The Company's sales to overseas
customers, principally in Asia and Europe, accounted for approximately
53% and 50% of the Company's net revenues for fiscal 2016 and fiscal
2015, respectively.  Payments are in United States dollars and are
therefore not subject to risks of currency fluctuation, foreign
duties and customs.

		Seasonality.  The Company does not consider its business
to be seasonal.

		Backlog.  Backlog for Benchtop Laboratory
Equipment products is not a significant factor because this line of
products is comprised of standard catalog items requiring lead times
which usually are not longer than two weeks.  There is no backlog for
Bioprocessing Systems.  The backlog for Catalyst Research Instrument
products as of June 30, 2016 was $995,000, all of which is expected
to be filled by June 30, 2017, although no assurance can be given, as
compared to a backlog of $2,570,400 as of June 30, 2015, all of which
was filled in fiscal 2016.

		Competition.   Most of the Company's principal
competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial,
production and marketing resources than the Company.  Competition
is generally based upon technical specifications, price, and product
recognition and acceptance.  The Company's main competition for its
Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products derives from private label
brand mixers offered by laboratory equipment distributors in the
United States and Europe and products exported from China. However,
the Company believes that despite its small size, it is a major
market participant in the global vortex mixer market.

		The Company's major competitors for its Genie brand
Benchtop Laboratory Equipment are Henry Troemner, Inc. (a private
label supplier to the two largest laboratory equipment distributors
in the U.S. and Europe), IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG, a German company,
Benchmark Scientific, Inc., (a United States importer of China-
produced products), and Heidolph Instruments GmbH, a German company.
The Company's main competitors for its Torbal brand products are
Ohaus Corporation, an American company, A&D Company Ltd., a Japanese
company, and Adam Equipment Co., Ltd., a British company.

		The primary competition for the Company's Catalyst
Research Instrument products is in the form of instruments produced
internally by research laboratory staffs of potential customers.
Major competitors in the United States include Quantachrome
Instruments (which is also a customer) and Micromeritics Instrument
Corporation, each a privately-held company.  The Company sells
instruments to Quantachrome under an OEM agreement.

       The potential major competitors for the Company's
Bioprocessing Systems are Applikon Biotechnology, B.V. (Netherlands),
DASGIP Technology GmbH (Germany), and PreSens - Precision
Sensing GmbH (Germany).

		Research and Development.  The Company incurred
research and development expenses, the majority of which related
to its Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products, of $349,000 during
fiscal 2016 compared to $392,200 during fiscal 2015.  The Company
expects research and development expenditures in the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2017 will be at approximately the same level as
those in fiscal 2016.

		Government and Environmental Regulation.  The
Company's products and claims with respect thereto have not
required approval of the Food and Drug Administration or any
other government approval.  The Company's manufacturing operations,
like those of the industry in general, are subject to numerous
existing and proposed, if adopted, federal, state, and local
regulations to protect the environment, establish occupational
safety and health standards and cover other matters.  The
Company believes that its operations are in compliance with
existing laws and regulations and the cost to comply is not
significant to the Company.

7

Employees.  As of September 2, 2016, the
Company employed 34 persons (24 for the Benchtop Laboratory
Equipment operations and 10 for the Catalyst Research Instruments
Operations) of whom 30 were full-time, including its three
executive officers.  All activities of the Bioprocessing Systems
Operations are being performed by employees of the other two
operations and consultants.  None of the Company's employees
are represented by any union.

		Available Information.  The Company's Annual
Report to Stockholders for fiscal 2016, includes its Annual
Report on Form 10-K.  The Annual Report will be mailed to
security holders together with the Company's proxy material
and solicitation as it relates to the Company's 2016 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders.  All the Company's reports, including
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
Current Reports on Form 8-K and other information filed with,
or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC" or the "Commission"), including amendments to such
reports, are available on the SEC's website that contains
such reports, proxy and information statements, and other
information regarding companies that file electronically
with the Commission. This information is available at
www.sec.gov.  In addition, all the Company's public filings
can be accessed through the Company's website at
https://scientificindustries.com/sec-filings.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

		In connection with the "safe harbor"
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, important risk factors are identified below that could
affect the Company's financial performance and could cause
the Company's actual results for future periods to differ
materially from any opinions or statements expressed with
respect to such future periods in any current statements.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any
forward-looking announcements to reflect future events or
circumstances.

Dependence on Major Customers

		Although the Company does not depend on any
one single major customer, sales to two Benchtop Laboratory
Equipment Operations customers accounted for a combined aggregate
of 9% and 12% of its total revenues for fiscal 2016 and fiscal
2015, respectively.  During fiscal 2016 one order from one
customer for catalyst research instruments accounted for 26% of
fiscal 2016 total revenues.

		No representation can be made that the Company
will be successful in continuing to retain either or both
customers, or not suffer a material reduction in sales either
which could have an adverse effect on future operating results
of the Company.

One Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Product Accounts for a
Substantial Portion of Revenues

		The Company has a limited number of Benchtop
Laboratory Equipment products with one product, the Vortex-Genie
2 Mixer, accounting for approximately 50% of Benchtop Laboratory
Equipment sales, for each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, and
28% and 34% of total revenues for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015,
respectively.

The Company is a Small Participant in Each of the Industries in
Which It Operates

		The Benchtop Laboratory Equipment industry is a
highly competitive mature industry.  Although the Vortex-Genie
2 Mixer has been widely accepted, the annual sales of the Benchtop
Laboratory Equipment products ($5,449,700 for fiscal 2016 and
$5,410,500 for fiscal 2015) are significantly lower than the
annual sales of many of its competitors in the industry.  The
principal competitors are substantially larger with much greater
financial, production and marketing resources than the Company.
There are constant new entrants into the vortex mixer market,
including those offering products imported from China, which the
Company is unable to compete with on price.  The Torbal line of
products is also a small market participant in its industry with
significant competition from well known brands.

                                  8

The production and sale of Catalyst Research
Instruments products is highly competitive.  Altamira's competitors
include several companies with greater resources and many
laboratories which produce their own instruments.

		The Company's Bioprocessing Systems operation is a
participant in the fast-growing laboratory-scale sector of the
larger bioprocessing products industry, which is dominated by
several large companies with much greater resources than the
Company.

 The Company's Ability to Grow and Compete Effectively Depends In
Part on Its Ability to Develop and Effectively Market New Products

 		The Company continuously invests in development
and marketing of new Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products with
a view to increasing revenues and reducing the Company's dependence
on the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer, including the acquisition of the Torbal
line of products in fiscal 2014.  However, gross revenues derived
from such other Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products only amounted
to $2,718,300 for fiscal 2016 and $2,716,100, for fiscal 2015.  The
segment's ability to compete will depend upon the Company's success
in continuing to develop and market new laboratory equipment
as to which no assurance can be given.

 		The Company relies heavily on distributors and their
catalogs to market the majority of its Benchtop Laboratory Equipment
products, as is customary in the industry.  Accordingly, sales of new
products are heavily dependent on the distributors' decision to
include and retain a new product in the distributors' catalogs and on
their websites.  It may be at least 24 to 36 months between the
completion of development of a product and the distribution of the
catalog in which it is first offered; furthermore, not all
distributors feature the Company's products in their catalogs.

		The Company's line of Catalyst Research Instruments
consists of only a few products.  The ability of the Company to
compete in this segment and expand the line will depend on its
ability to make engineering improvements to existing products and
develop and add new products incorporating more current technology.
Over the last few years the Company has introduced two new catalyst
research products to increase its product offerings and has
continuously sought to expand its outside sales force.

		The success of the Company's new Bioprocessing
Systems operation will be heavily dependent on its ability to
develop and produce new products.  Such products are of a complex
nature and are taking longer to develop than previously anticipated.
In addition, they will be subject to beta testing by end users,
which could result in design and/or production changes which could
further delay development time.  The sale and marketing of the
products, at least initially, will be through the Company's
attendance at trade shows, website, online marketing, and a few
select distributors.

 		No assurance can be given that the amounts
allocated by the Company for its new product development and
sales and marketing programs will be sufficient to develop
additional commercially feasible products which will be accepted
by the marketplace, or that any distributor will include or retain
any such products in its catalogs and websites.

The Company May Be Subject to General Economic, Political,
and Social Factors

 		Orders for the Company's products, particularly
its Catalyst Research Instruments products, depend in part, on
the customer's ability to secure funds to finance purchases,
especially government funding.  Availability of funds can be
affected by budgetary constraints.  Factors including a general
economic recession, the European crisis, slowdown in Asian
economies, or a major terrorist attack may have a negative
impact on the availability of funding including government or
academic grants to potential customers.

9

As discussed in Item 1, the Company has
significant sales to overseas customers.  The rising dollar
against foreign currencies has a negative impact on sales,
because the Company's products, which are paid in dollars,
become more expensive.

		The Company's ability to secure new Catalyst
Research Instruments orders can also be affected by changes
in domestic and international policies pertaining to energy
and the environment, which could affect funding of potential
customers.

The Company is Heavily Dependent on Outside Suppliers for the
Components of Its Products

		The Company purchases all its components
from outside suppliers and relies on a few suppliers for some
Benchtop Laboratory Equipment components, mostly due
to cost considerations.  Most of the Company's suppliers,
including United States vendors, produce the components directly
or indirectly in overseas factories, and orders are subject
to long lead times and potential other risks related to
production in a foreign country.  To minimize the risk of
supply shortages, the Company keeps more than normal quantities
on hand of the critical components that cannot easily be procured
or, where feasible and cost effective, purchases are made from
more than one supplier.

		However, a shortage of such components could
halt production and have a material negative effect on the
Company's operations.

The Company's Ability to Compete Depends in Part on Its Ability
To Secure and Maintain Proprietary Rights to its Products

       	The Company has no patent protection for its principal
Benchtop Laboratory Equipment product, the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer,
the Torbal balances, or for its Catalyst Research Instruments
products and limited patent protection on a few other Benchtop
Laboratory Equipment products.  There are several competitive
products available in the marketplace possessing similar technical
specifications and design.

       	As part of the asset purchase by SBI during fiscal
2012, the Company acquired the rights to various patents for
bioprocessing products which it licenses from UMBC.

       	There can be no assurance that any patent issued,
licensed or sublicensed to the Company provides or will
provide the Company with competitive advantages or will not
be challenged by third parties.  Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that others will not independently develop similar
products or design around the patents.  Any of the foregoing
activities could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Moreover, the enforcement by the Company of its patent or license
rights may require substantial litigation costs.

The Company Has Limited Management Resources

       	The loss of the services of any of Ms. Helena Santos,
the Company's Chief Executive and Financial Officer and President,
Mr. Robert Nichols, the Company's Executive Vice President, Mr.
Brookman March, President  of Altamira, and Mr. Karl Nowosielski,
Torbal Division President or any material expansion of the
Company's operations could place a significant additional strain
on the Company's limited management resources and could be
materially adverse to the Company's operating results and
financial condition.

The Common Stock of the Company is Thinly Traded and is Subject
to Volatility

       	As of September 2, 2016, there were 1,489,112 shares of
Common Stock of the Company outstanding, of which 364,223 shares
(25%) were held by the directors and officers of the Company.
The Common Stock of the Company is traded on the Over-the-
Counter Bulletin Board and, historically, has been thinly
traded.  There have been a number of trading days during
fiscal 2016 on which no trades of the Company's Common Stock
were reported.  Accordingly, the market price for the Common
Stock is subject to great volatility.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

		Forward-Looking statements.  Certain statements
contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but
are forward-looking statements that are based upon various
assumptions about future conditions.  Actual events in the
future could differ materially from those described in the
forward-looking information.  Numerous unknown factors and
future events could cause such differences, including but not
limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of
marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of
competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors
affecting the Company's business that are beyond the Company's
control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report.
Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.  This Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's
financial statements and the related notes included
elsewhere in this report.

Overview.  The Company reflected income before
income tax expense of $218,900 for fiscal 2016 compared to a
loss before income tax benefit of $7,300 for fiscal 2015,
primarily due to the higher sales and profits from the Catalyst
Research Instruments operations and higher profits from the
Benchtop Laboratory Equipment operations, partially offset by
losses incurred by the Bioprocessing Systems operations.  The
results reflected non-cash amounts for depreciation,
amortization, and impairment of intangible assets of $641,600
for fiscal 2016 and $434,800 for fiscal 2015.

		Results of Operations.  Net sales for fiscal
2016 increased $1,749,200 (22.3%) to $9,597,600 from $7,848,400
for fiscal 2015, reflecting increases of $1,716,900 (74.1%) in
net sales of catalyst research instruments, due to the large order
to an overseas customer and $39,200 (.7%) in benchtop laboratory
equipment sales, partially offset by a decrease of $6,900 (5.7%)
in the Bioprocessing Systems operations revenues.  The benchtop
laboratory equipment sales reflected $1,175,800 of Torbal brand
product sales for fiscal 2016, compared to $1,120,500 in fiscal
2015.  The Company's Bioprocessing Systems operations, which began
selling its new products expected to soon be fully marketable,
reflected sales of $22,000 of such new products.

       Sales of catalyst research instruments are comprised of a
small number of large orders, historically averaging more than
$100,000 each, while the sales of benchtop laboratory equipment
comprise of a large number of small orders.  As of June 30, 2016,
the order backlog for catalyst research instruments was $995,000,
all of which is expected to be shipped during fiscal year ending
June 30, 2017, compared to $2,570,400 as of June 30, 2015.

		Revenues derived from the Bioprocessing Systems
Operations comprise primarily of net royalties received from
sublicensees. The Company expects to start launching new products
currently under development during the fiscal year ending June
30, 2017, although no assurance can be given.

	        The gross profit percentage for fiscal 2016 was
40.8% compared to 39.8% for fiscal 2015 due to higher margins on
sales of catalyst research instruments resulting from the
significant order in fiscal 2016, and higher margins on sales
of benchtop laboratory equipment due to lower overhead costs.

		General and administrative expenses for fiscal
2016 decreased $5,700 (0.3%) to $1,695,200 compared to
$1,700,900 for fiscal 2015.

		Selling expenses for fiscal 2016 increased
$370,100 (35.4%) to $1,415,400 from $1,045,300 from for fiscal
2015 due primarily to increased outside sales commissions for
the Catalyst Research Instruments operations related to a
large overseas order.

12

Research and development expenses decreased
by $43,200 (11.0%) to $349,000 for fiscal 2016 compared to
$392,200 for fiscal 2015, primarily due to decreased new
product development costs incurred by the Benchtop Laboratory
Equipment operations, partially offset by higher product
development costs incurred by the Bioprocessing Systems
operations.

	       Total other expense was $26,100 for fiscal
2016 compared to $9,500 income in fiscal 2015, due to the
interest expense related to the financing of a large
order for catalyst research instruments.

	        Income tax expense for fiscal 2016 was
$53,300 compared to a tax benefit of $16,000 for the prior
year due to the income for the current year.

	        As a result of the foregoing, the Company
recorded net income for fiscal 2016 of $165,600, compared
to net income of $8,700 for fiscal 2015.

	         Liquidity and Capital Resources.  Cash
and cash equivalents increased by $763,000 to $1,245,000
as of June 30, 2016 from $482,000 as of June 30, 2015.

	        Net cash provided by operating activities
was $880,400 for fiscal 2016 compared to $147,400 for
fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased income, increased
accounts payable and accrued expenses amounts, and an
amount for impairment of intangible assets and a change
in fair value of contingent consideration.

 	        Net cash provided by investing activities
was $194,400 for fiscal 2016 compared to net cash used of
$250,700 for fiscal 2015 primarily due to the release of
previously held restricted cash as collateral for the
Company's working capital line of credit with its bank.
The Company used $311,800 in financing activities in
fiscal 2016 compared to cash provided of $91,600 in
fiscal 2015, primarily due to the repayment of certain
notes payable.  The Company borrowed $970,000 under
the export-import line of credit during fiscal 2016 to
finance a large order of catalyst research instruments
and repaid the debt at the end of fiscal 2016.

	       The Company's working capital increased
by $620,600 to $4,031,900 as of June 30, 2016 compared
to $3,411,300 as of June 30, 2015, mainly due to
improved operating results excluding depreciation and
amortization.

The Company has two lines of credit through
June 2017 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania - an
Export-Related Revolving Line of Credit which is guaranteed
by the Export-Import Bank of the United States which
provides for export-related borrowings of up to $200,000,
bearing interest at prime plus 1% and an annual
fee of 1.75% and a second one-year Demand Line of Credit
which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular
working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently
3.50%.  Advances on both lines are secured by a pledge of
the Company's assets including inventory, accounts, chattel
paper, equipment and general intangibles of the Company.
As of June 30, 2016 no borrowings were outstanding under
either line.

13

Management believes that the Company will
be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12
months ending June 30, 2017 from its available financial
resources including the lines of credit, its cash and
investment securities, and operations.

	          Capital Expenditures.  During fiscal 2016,
the Company incurred $92,000 in capital expenditures.  The
Company expects that based on its current operations, its
capital expenditures will not be materially higher for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.

		Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  None.

Item 8.	  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

		The Financial Statements required by this
item are attached hereto on pages F1-F25.

Item 9.	  Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on
Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

	        Not applicable.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.

		Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.  As of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, based on an evaluation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934), the Chief Executive and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the applicable time periods
specified by the SEC's rules and forms. The Company also
concluded that information required to be disclosed in such
reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

		Management's Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting.  Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the
Company's financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  The Company's internal
controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

		The Chief Executive and Financial Officer of the
Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 based
on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework.

		Based on the assessment of the Company's Chief
Executive and Financial Officer of the Company, it was concluded
that as of June 30, 2016, the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting were effective based on these criteria.

		This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was
not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public
accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's
report in this annual report.

		Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. There was no change in the Company's internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
quarter that materially affected or is reasonably likely to
materially affect the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting.

14

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls.
The Company's management, including its Chief Executive and Financial
Officer, believes that its disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are
effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management
does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its
internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can  provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision
making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people or by management override
of the controls. The design of any system of controls also
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions; over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost
effective control system, misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected.

Item 11.  Executive Compensation.

		Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The
Compensation Committee reviews and recommends to the Board
of Directors the compensation to be paid to each executive
officer.  Executive compensation, in all instances except
for the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"),
is based on recommendations from the CEO.  The CEO makes a
determination by comparing the performance of each executive
being reviewed with objectives established at the beginning
of each fiscal year and with objectives established during
the business year with regard to the success of the
achievement of such objectives and the successful execution
of management targets and goals.

		With respect to the compensation of the CEO,
the Committee considers performance criteria, 50% of which
is related to the direction, by the CEO, of the reporting
executives, the establishment of executive objectives as
components for the successful achievement of Company goals
and the successful completion of programs leading to the
successful completion of the Business Plan for the Company
and 50% is based on the achievement by the Company of its
financial and personnel goals tempered by the amount of
the income or loss of  the Company during the fiscal year.

		The compensation at times includes grants
of options under its stock option plan to the named
executives.  Each officer is employed pursuant to a long-
term employment agreement, containing terms proposed by
the Committee and approved as reasonable by the Board of
Directors.  The Board is cognizant that as a relatively
small company, the Company has limited resources and
opportunities with respect to recruiting and retaining
key executives.  Accordingly, the Company has relied upon
long-term employment agreements and grants of stock
options to retain qualified personnel.

		Compensation for each of its executive
officers provided by their employment agreements were
based on the foregoing factors and the operating and
financial results of the segments under their management.

		The following table summarizes all
compensation paid by the Company to each of its executive
officers for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Scientific Industries, Inc.
Bohemia, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Scientific Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company")
as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we
express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Scientific Industries, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

1.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Scientific Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company")
design, manufacture, and market a variety of benchtop laboratory
equipment, bioprocessing products and catalyst research instruments.
The Company is headquartered in Bohemia, New York where it produces
benchtop laboratory equipment for research and has another location
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it produces a variety of custom-
made catalyst research instruments and designs bioprocessing products,
and an administrative facility in Oradell, New Jersey related to
benchtop laboratory equipment. The equipment sold by the Company
includes mixers, shakers, stirrers, refrigerated incubators, pharmacy
balances and scales, catalyst characterization instruments, reactor
systems and high throughput systems. The Company also sublicenses
certain patents and technology under a license with the University
of Maryland, Baltimore County, and receives royalty fees from the
sublicenses.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Scientific Industries, Inc., Scientific Packaging
Industries, Inc., an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary, Altamira
Instruments, Inc. ("Altamira"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary, and Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. ("SBI"), a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, (all collectively
referred to as the "Company"). All material intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized when all the following
criteria are met:

*	Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, including
receipt of a written purchase order agreement which is binding
on the customer.
*	Goods are shipped and title passes.
*	Prices are fixed and determinable.
*	Collectability is reasonably assured.
*	All material obligations under the agreement have been
substantially performed.

Revenues are net of normal discounts. Shipping and handling fees
billed to customers are included in net revenues, while the
related costs are included in cost of revenues.

Substantially all orders are F.O.B. shipping point, all sales
are final without right of return or payment contingencies, and
there are no special sales arrangements or agreements with any
customers.

Royalty revenue received under the Company's sublicenses is
recorded net of payments due to its licensors.

1.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
with a maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.  At
times, cash balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance limit.  As of June 30, 2016
and 2015, $497,200 and $50,000 respectively of cash balances were
in excess of such limit.

Accounts Receivable

In order to record the Company's accounts receivable at their net
realizable value, the Company must assess their collectability.
A considerable amount of judgment is required in order to make
this assessment, including an analysis of historical bad debts
and other adjustments, a review of the aging of the Company's
receivables, and the current creditworthiness of the Company's
customers.  The Company has recorded allowances for receivables
which it considered uncollectible, including amounts for the
resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such
as disputed invoices, customer satisfaction claims and pricing
discrepancies.  However, depending on how such potential issues
are resolved, or if the financial condition of any of the
Company's customers was to deteriorate and its ability to make
required payments became impaired, increases in these allowances
may be required.  The Company actively manages its accounts
receivable to minimize credit risk.  The Company does not obtain
collateral for its accounts receivable.

Customer Advances

In the ordinary course of business, customers may make advance
payments for purchase orders. Such amounts, when received, are
categorized as liabilities under the caption customer advances.

Investment Securities

Securities available for sale are carried at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses reported in a separate component
of shareholders' equity. Realized gains or losses are
determined based on the specific identification method.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on
a first-in, first-out basis) or market value, and have been
reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories.
The estimate is based on management's review of inventories
on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Cost of
work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material,
labor and manufacturing overhead.

AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015

1.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of
property and equipment is provided for primarily by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-
line method over the remaining term of the related lease or
the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is
shorter.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of acquired technology,
customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents,
licenses, websites, intellectual property and research and
development ("IPR&D"), trademarks and trade names. All
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally 3 to 10 years. The Company continually evaluates
the remaining estimated useful lives of intangible assets
that are being amortized to determine whether events or
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period
of amortization.

Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the
fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business
combination. Goodwill and long-lived intangible assets are
tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with
the provisions of ASC No. 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other" ("ASC No. 350"). ASC No. 350 requires that goodwill
be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level
(operating segment or one level below an operating segment)
on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment
test requires judgment, including the identification of
reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to
reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units,
and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
The Company tests goodwill and long-lived assets annually
as of June 30, the last day of its fiscal year, unless an
event occurs that would cause the Company to believe the
value is impaired at an interim date. The Company concluded
as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 there was no impairment of
goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company follows the provisions of ASC No. 360-10,
"Property, Plant and Equipment - Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets ("ASC No. 360-10"). ASC No. 360-10 which
requires evaluation of the need for an impairment charge
relating to long-lived assets whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. If an evaluation for
impairment is required, the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to
the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write down to
a new depreciable basis is required. If required, an
impairment charge is recorded based on an estimate of
future discounted cash flows. For the year ended June 30,
2016, the Company determined that the intangible assets of
SBI were impaired, and accordingly an impairment charge of
$212,700 was recorded.

1.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(Continued)

Income Taxes

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return.  Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method.
The Company provides for federal, and state income
taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred
due to timing differences between reporting income
and expenses for financial statement purposes versus
tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributed
to temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect of a
change in income tax rates is recognized as income or
expense in the period that includes the enactment date.

The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions
only if those positions are more likely than not of being
sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at
the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized.  Changes in recognition or measurement are
reflected in the period in which the change in judgment
occurs.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising
expense amounted to $79,800 and $79,400 for the years ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Research and Development

Research and development costs consisting of expenses for
activities that are useful in developing and testing new
products, as well as expenses that may significantly improve
existing products, are expensed as incurred.

Stock Compensation Plan

The Company has a ten-year stock option plan (the "2012 Plan")
which provides for the grant of options to purchase up to
100,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.05
per share ("Common Stock"), plus 57,000 shares under options
previously granted under the 2002 Stock Option Plan of the
Company (the "Prior Plan"). The 2012 Plan provides for the
granting of incentive or non-incentive stock options as
defined in the 2012 Plan and options under the 2012 Plan
may be granted until 2022. Incentive stock options may be
granted to employees at an exercise price equal to 100%
(or 110% if the optionee owns directly or indirectly more
than 10% of the outstanding voting stock) of the fair
market value of the shares of Common Stock on the date
of the grant. Non-incentive stock options shall be
granted at the fair market value of the shares of Common
Stock on the date of grant.  At June 30, 2016 and 2015,
79,500 and 84,500 shares respectively, of Common Stock
were available for grant of options under the 2012 Plan.

Stock Compensation Plan (Continued)

Stock-based compensation is accounted for in accordance
with ASC No. 718 "Compensation-Stock Compensation"
("ASC No. 718") which requires compensation costs related
to stock-based payment transactions to be recognized.
With limited exceptions, the amount of compensation cost
is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. In addition,
liability awards are measured at each reporting period.
Compensation costs are recognized over the period that
an employee provides service in exchange for the award.
During the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company granted 5,000 and 4,000 options, respectively,
to employees that had a fair value of $9,500 and $7,100,
respectively. The fair value of the options granted
during fiscal year 2016 and 2015 were determined using
the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The
weighted average assumptions used for fiscal 2016 and
2015, was an expected life of 10 years; risk free
interest rate of 1.82% and 1.93%; volatility of 51%
and 52%, and dividend yield of 0% for both years. The
Company did not declare dividends during the years
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Therefore a zero value
for the expected dividend value factor was used to
determine the fair value of options granted. The
weighted-average value per share of the options
granted in 2016 and 2015 was $1.89 and $1.77, and
total stock-based compensation costs were $11,800
and $10,900 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Stock-based compensation costs
related to nonvested awards expected to be recognized
in the future are $1,000 and $3,300 as of June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates
are used for, but not limited to, the allowance for
doubtful accounts, slow-moving inventory reserves,
depreciation and amortization, assumptions made in
valuing equity instruments issued for services, and
the fair values of intangibles and goodwill. The
actual results experienced by the Company may differ
materially from management's estimates.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share includes
the dilutive effect of stock options.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers amending
revenue recognition requirements for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. This update provides guidance on
how revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. This
determination is made in five steps: (i) identify the
contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the
transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations in the contract; and
(v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB deferred
the effective date to fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 and early adoption of the standard is
permitted, but not before the original effective date of
December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the effect
this guidance will have on the consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation -
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-
Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that a
Performance Target Could be Achieved After the Requisite
Service Period. This update affects reporting entities
that grant their employee's targets that affects vesting
could be achieved after the requisite service period. The
new standard requires that a performance target that
affects vesting and that could be achieved after the
requisite services period be treated as a performance
condition. The new standard will be effective for the
Company beginning July 1, 2016.  The Company does not
expect the adoption to have a material impact on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
"Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory",
that requires inventory not measured using either the
last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method
to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable
value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling
prices in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal
and transportation. The new standard will be effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those fiscal years,
and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption
to have a material impact on its financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance
simplifying the balance sheet classification of
deferred taxes.  The new guidance requires that
deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial
position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of
an entity be offset and presented as a single amount
is not affected by the new guidance. The guidance
is effective for public companies for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, with early adoption permitted as of the
beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
The new guidance may be applied either prospectively
to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or
retrospectively to all periods presented. The
Company does not expect the adoption to have a
material impact on its financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)

In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative
guidance that requires lessees to account for
most leases on their balance sheets with the
liability being equal to the present value of
the lease payments. The right-of-use asset
will be based on the lease liability adjusted
for certain costs such as direct costs. Lease
expense will be recognized similar to current
accounting guidance with operating leases
resulting in a straight-line expense and
financing leases resulting in a front-loaded
expense similar to the current accounting for
capital leases. This guidance becomes effective
for the Company's fiscal 2020 first quarter,
with early adoption permitted. This guidance
must be adopted using a modified retrospective
transition approach for leases that exist or
are entered into after the beginning of the
earliest comparative period in the financial
statements, and provides for certain practical
expedients. The Company is currently evaluating
the timing, impact and method of applying this
guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting" (ASU 2016-09). Areas for simplification
in this update involve several aspects of
accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement

3.	Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date.  Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.

3.	Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued)

The accounting guidance also expands the disclosure requirements
around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for
valuation inputs.  The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into
three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in
measuring fair value are observable in the market.  Each fair
value measurement is reported in one of the three levels, which
is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement in its entirety.  These levels are
described below:

	Level 1	Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted
prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.

	Level 2	Quoted prices in markets that are not
considered to be active or financial instruments for which
all significant inputs are observable, either directly or
indirectly.

	Level 3	Prices or valuation that require inputs
that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
unobservable.

In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to
maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs.  The Company calculated the fair value
of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded
price of similar or identical instruments where available or
based on other observable instruments.  These calculations take
into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its
counterparties.  The Company has not changed its valuation
techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets
and liabilities during the period.

The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are
based on a probability weighted approach derived from the
estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment
with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria.
The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not
observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies
this liability as Level 3 in the table below:

The following tables set forth by level within the fair value
hierarchy the Company's financial assets that were accounted
for at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2016 and
2015 according to the valuation techniques the Company used
to determine their fair values:

The Company's contingent obligations require cash payments
to the sellers of certain acquired operations based on
royalty payments received or operating results achieved.
These contingent considerations are classified as liabilities
and the liabilities are remeasured to an estimated fair value
at each reporting date.  During the year ended June 30, 2016,
the Company recorded an increase in the estimated fair value
of contingent liabilities of approximately $110,000 related to
its Bioprocessing Systems Operations segment.

violate any law or agreement governing Grantor or to which Granter is

Enforceability  of  Collateral.  To the extent the Collateral consists of
accounts,  chattel  paper,  or general intangibles, as defined by the
Uniform Commercial Code,  the Collateral is enforceable in accordance with
its terms, is genuine, and fully complies with  all applicable  laws
and regulations  concerning form,  content  and manner of  preparation and
execution, and all persons appearing to  be obligated  on the Collateral
have authority and capacity to contract and are in fact obligated as they
appea rto  be on the Collateral.  At the time any account becomes subject
to a security interest in favor of Lender, the account shall be a good and
valid account representing an undisputed,   bonafide indebtedness incurred
by the account debtor, for merchandise held subject to delivery  instructions
or previously  shipped or delivered

pursuant to  a contract of sale,  or for services previously performed by
Grantor with  or for the account debtor.   So long as this Agreement
remains in effect,   Grantor  shall not,  without  Lender's prior written
consent,  compromise,  settle,   adjust,   or extend payment under or with
regard to  any  such Accounts.    There  shall  be no setoffs or counterclaims
against any of the Collateral,   and no  agreement shall have been
made under  which any deductions  or discounts  may be claimed concerning
the Collateral except those disclosed to Lender in writing.
Location  of tlie Collateral.  Except  in  the ordinary course of Grantor's
business,   Grantor agrees to keep the Collateral   (or to the extent the
Collateral consists   of  intangible  property such as accounts or general
intangibles,  the  records  concerning  the  Collateral)   at Grantor's
address shown  above  or at such  other locations as are acceptableto  Lender.
Upon Lender's request, Grantor will deliver  to Lender in  form
satisfactory to Lender  a schedule of real properties and Collateral
locations  relating to Grantor's operations,  including   without   limitation
the following:   (1)    all  real property Grantor  owns or is purchasing;
(2)  all real property Grantor is renting or leasing; (3)  all  storage
facilities Grantor owns  rents,  leases,  or uses;  and  (4)   all other
properties where Collateral is  or may be located.
Removal   of the Collateral.  Except in the ordinary course of Grantor's
business,  including the sales  of inventory,   Grantor shall   not remove
the Collateral from its existing location  without  Lender's prior written
consent.   To the extent that the Collateral   consists of vehicles,   or
other titled property,   Grantor  shall  not take or permit any action which
would  require application for  certificates  of title  for the vehicles
outside  the State of New York,  without  Lender's prior written  consent.
Grantor shall,  whenever requested, advise Lender of the exact
Location of the Collateral.  Except in the ordinary course of Grantor's
business, Grantor agrees to keep the Collateral (or to the extent the
Collateral consists of intangible property such as accounts or general
intangibles, the records concerning the Collateral) at Grantor's address
shown above or at such other locations as are acceptable to Lender.  Upon
Lender's request, Grantor will deliver to Lender in form satisfactory
to Lender a schedule of real properties and Collateral locations relating
to Grantor's operations, including without limitation the following:
(1) all real property Grantor owns or is purchasing; (2) all real property
Grantor is renting or leasing; (3) all storage facilities Grantor owns,
rents, leases, or uses; and (4) all other properties where Collateral is or
may be located.

collected  in the  ordinary   course  of  Grantor's  business,   or  as
otherwise provided  for  in this Agreement,   Grantor shall not sell,  offer
to  sell,  or otherwise  transfer  or dispose  of the Collateral.     While
Grantor is  no   in  default under this Agreement, Grantor may sell inventory,
but only in the ordinary course of its  business  and  only to buyers
who qualify as a  buyer  in the ordinary course of business.   A sale in  the
ordinary course of Grantor's business does not include a transfer in
partial or tota  satisfaction  of a  debt or any bulk sale.   Grantor
shall not pledge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise  permit the Collateral to
be subject to any lien,   security interest,  encumbrance, or charge,  other
than the security  interest  provided for  in  this  Agreement,  without
the prior  written  consent of Lender.  This includes security interests
even if junior in right to the security interests granted under this
Agreement.  Unless waived by Lender, all proceeds from  any disposition
of the Collateral (for whatever  reason) shall be held   in trust  for
Lender and slall not be commingled   with  any other funds; provided
however, this requirement shall not constitute consent by Lender to any
sale  or other  disposition.    Upon receipt,   Grantor shall immediately
deliver  any such proceedsto  Lender.
Title.   Grantor represents and  warrants to Lender that Grantor holds
good and marketable title  to the Collateral,  free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances except for the lien of this Agreement.   No financing
statement covering any of the Collateral is  on file in any public
office  other than  those  which  reflect  the security  interest created
by this  Agreement  or to  which   Lender has specifically  consented.
Grantor  shall  defend Lender's rights in the Collateral against the claims
and demands of  all other persons.
Repairs  and   Maintenance.   Grantor  agrees to  keep and maintain, and
to cause others  to keep  and maintain, the Collateral  in good order,
repair and condition  at all times while  this  Agreement remains in
effect.   Grantor further agreesto  pay when due  all  claims  for work done
on,  or services  rendered  or material   furnished in connection  with
the Collateral  so that  no lien or encumbrance may ever attach to  or be
filed against the Collateral.
Inspection of Collateral.  Lender and Lender's designated representatives
and agents shall have the right at all reasonable  times to examine
and inspect the Collateral  wherever  located.
Taxes, Assessments and Liens.   Grantor will   pay when due all taxes,
assessments and liens upon the Collateral,  its use or operation,  upon
this Agreement,  upon  any promissory note or notes evidencing the
Indebtedness, or upon any of the other Related  Documents.    Grantor
may withhold any such payment or may elect to contest any lien if  Grantor
is in good faith conducting an appropriate  proceeding  to contest
the obligation to  pay and  so long  as Lender's interest in the Collateral
is not jeopardized in Lender's  sole  opinion.   If  the Collateral   is
subjected  to lien  which is not discharged within fifteen (15)  days,
Grantor shall deposit with  Lender cash,  a  sufficient  corporate surety
bond  or othe  security   satisfactory  to  Lender in an amount adequate
to  provide for  the discharge of  the  lien  plus any interest,   costs,
reasonable attorneys'  fees or  other charges that could accrue  as a
result of foreclosure or sale of the Collateral.   In  any contest  Grantor
shall  defend  self and Lender and  shall satisfy any final  adverse
judgment before enforcement against  the Collateral. Grantor shall name
Lender as an additional  obligee under any surety bond furnished in the
contest proceedings.   Grantor further agrees to furnish  Lender with
evidencetha  such taxes, assessments, and governmentaland other charges
have been paid in  full  and in  a timely  manner.  Grantor  may
withhold any such  payment or  may elect to contest any lien if Grantor
is in good faith conducting an appropriate   proceeding  to contest the
obligation  to filay and so long  as Lender's  interest in the Collateral
is  not jeopardized.
Compliance With Governmental Requirements.   Grantor shall comply
promptly  with  all   laws,  ordinances,   rules  and  regulations
of  all governmental  authorities,   now or hereafter in  effect,
applicable to  the ownership,  production,  disposition,  or use of
the Collateral, including all laws or regulations  relating  to the
undue erosion of highly-erodible land  or relating to the conversion
of wetlands for the production  of an agricultural  product or  commodity.
Grantor  may contest in good faith any such law, ordinance or regulation
and withhold compliance during any proceeding,  including  appropriate
appeals, so long as Lender's interest in the Collateral,  in Lender's
opinion, is not jeopardized.
Hazardous Substances.  Grantor  represents and warrants that the
Collateral never has been,  and never will  be so long  as this Agreement
remains a lien on the Collateral, used in violation of any Environmental
Laws or for the generation, manufacture, storage, transportation,
treatment,  disposal,  release or  threatened release of any Hazardous
Substance.   The representationsand warranties  contained herein are
based on Grantor's  due diligence  in  investigating the Collateral for
Hazardous Substances.   Grantor hereby  (1) releases and waives  any
future  claims against Lender for indemnity or contribution in the
event  Grantor  becomes liable  for  cleanup or other  costs under any
Environmental  Laws,  and (2) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Lendera gainst any and all claims  and losses resulting from a
breachof this provision  of this Agreement. This obligation to indemnify
and defend shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness and the
satisfaction  o'f this Agreement.
Maintenance of Casualty Insurance.   Grantor shall procure and maintain
all risks insurance, including  without limitation fire, theft and
liability coverage  together with such other insuranceas Lender may
require with  respect to the Collateral,  in form,  amounts,  coverages
and basis reasonably  acceptable  to Lender and issued  by a  company
or  companies reasonably acceptable to Lender.  Grantor, upon request of
Lender,  will  deliver to Lender from time to time  the policies or
certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender,  including
stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without
at least ten (10)  days' prior written  notice to  Lender and not
including  any disclaimer  of the  insurer's  liability  for failure to
give such a notice.   Each  insurance policy also  shall include an
endorsement providing  that coverage in favor of Lender will not  be
impaired in any way by any act, omission or default of Grantor or any
other person.   In  connection with  all  policies covering assets in
which Lender holds or  is offered a security interest,  Grantor will
provide Lender with such loss payable or other endorsements as Lender
may require.    If Grantor at any time  fails to  obtain or maintain
any insurance  as required  under  this Agreement,   lender  may (but
shall  not be obligated to)  obtain such insurance as Lender deems
appropriate, including if Lender so chooses "single interest insurance,"
which  will cover only Lender's interest in the Collateral.
Application o  Insurance Proceeds.    Grantor shall promptly notify
Lender of  any loss or damage to  the Collateral,   whether  or not  such
casualty or loss is  covered by insurance.    Lender may make proof of
loss  if Grantor fails to do so within   fifteen  (15)   days of the
casualty.

All  proceeds.  If any insurance on  the Collateral, including accrued
proceeds thereon, shall be held  by Lender as part of the Collateral.
If Lender consents to repair or replacement of the damaged or destroyed
Collateral, Lender shall,  upon satisfactory proof of expenditure,    pay
or reimburse grantor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair
or restoration.   If Lender does not consent to repair or replacement
of the Collateral, Lender shall retain a sufficient amount of the proceeds
to  pay all of the  Indebtedness,  and shall  pay the balance to Grantor.
Any proceeds which  have not been disbursed within six (6)  months after
their receipt  and which  Grantor has not committed to the repair or
restoration  of the Collateral shall  be used to prepay the Indebtedness.
Grantor hereby appoints  Lender as its  attorney-in-fact with  full
power and  authority  to endorse in  Grantor's name any check or draft
representing the proceeds of any insurance  on the  Collateral and to settle
or compromise in  Grantor's  name any claims with respect to such insurance.
Insurance Reserves.  Lender may require Grantor to maintain with  Lender
reserves for payment of insurance premiums,   which reserves shall
be created by monthly payments from Grantor of a sum estimated by Lender
to be sufficient to produce,  at least fifteen  (15)   days before
the premium  ue date,  amounts  at least equal to the insurance premiums to
be paid.   If fifteen (15)  days before payment is  due,   the reserve
funds are insufficient,   Grantor  shall  upon demand pay any deficiency
to Lender.  The reserve funds shall be held by Lender as a general
deposit and shall  constitute a non-interest-bearing  account which Lender
may satisfy by payment of the insurance premiums required to be
paid by Grantor as they become due.   Lender does not hold the reserve funds
in trust for Grantor, and Lender is  not the agent of Grantor for
payment of the insurance premiums required to  be paid by Grantor.
The responsibility for  the  payment of  premiums   shall remain
Grantor's sole responsibility.
Insurance  Reports. Grantor, upon request of Lender, shall furnish to
Lender reports on each existing  policy of  insurance  showing  such
information a  Lender may reasonably request including the following:
(1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks insured;  (3) the amount
of the policy; (4) the property insured;  (5) the then current value
on the basis of which insurance has been obtained and the manner of
determining  that value;  and (6) the expiration date of the policy.
In addition,  Grantor shall upon request by Lender (however not more
often than annually) have an independent  appraiser satisfactory to
Lender determine, as applicable, the cash value  or replacement
cost of the Collateral.
Financing Statements.  Grantor authorizes  Lender to file a UCC financing
statement, or alternatively,  a copy of this Agreement to perfect
Lender's security  interest.   At  Lender's  request, Granter additionally
agrees to  sign all other documents  that  are necessary to  perfect,
protect, and flontinue Lender's  security interest in the Property.
Grantor will pay all filing fees,  title  transfer fees,  and other fees
and costs involved unless prohibited by law  or unless Lender is required
by law to pay such fees and costs.    Grantor irrevocably appoints Lender to
execute documents  necessary to transfer title  if there is a default.
Lender may file a copy of this  Agreement as a financing  statement.
GRANTOR'S RIGHT TO POSSESSION AND TO COLLECTACCOUNTS.   Until default and
except as otherwise  provided  below  with  respect to accounts,  Grantor
may have  possession of the tangible personal property and beneficial use
of all  the Collateral  and may use it  in  any lawful manner not
inconsistent with this  Agreement or the Related Documents, provided that
Grantor's right  to possession and  beneficial use shall not apply to any
Collaleral  where possession of the Collateral by Lender is  required by
law to perfect Lender's security interest in such Collateral.
Until otherwise notified by Lender,   Granter may collect any of the
Collateral consisting of accounts.   At  any time  and even though  no Default
exists,  Lender ma  exercise its rights to collect the accounts and to notify
account debtors to make payments directly to Lender for application to the
lndebtedness.  If Lender at any time has possession of any Collateral,
whether  before or after Default,  Lender shall  be deemed to have exercised
reasonable  care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral if Lender
takes such action for that purpose as Granter shall request or as Lender,
in Lender's  sole  discretion,   shall deem appropriate under the
circumstances,  but failure to honor any  request by Grantor shall  not
of itself  be deemed  to be a failure to exercise reasonable care.  Lender
shall  not be required to take any steps necessary to preserve any rights
in  the Collateral  against  prior parties,  nor  to protect, preserve or
maintain  any security interest  given  to secure the Indebtedness.
LENDER'S EXPENDITURES.   If any  action or proceeding is commenced that
would  materially affect  Lender's  interest  in the Collateral or  if
Granter fails  to  comply with  any provision   of  this Agreement or any
Related  Documents, including  but  not  limited to  Grantor's failure  to
discharge or pay when  due any  amounts Grantor is required to discharge
or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents,  Lender on Grantor's
behalf  may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that  Lender
deems appropriate, including but not limited  to discharging  or paying
all taxes,  liens,  security interests, encumbrances and other claims,
at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and paying all costs for
insuring,  maintaining and preserving the Collateral.  All such expenditures
incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then  bear interest at
the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender
to the date of repayment by Grantor.   All such  expenses will become a
part of the Indebtedness and,  at Lender's  option, will  (A)  be payable
on demand;  (B)  be added to the balance  of the  Note and be apportioned
among and be payable  with  any installment payments to become due during
either  (1) the term of any applicable  insurance  policy;  or  (2)  the
remaining term of the Note;  or  (C)  be treated as a balloon payment
which will be due and payable at the Note's  maturity.   The Agreement also
will  secure payment of these amounts.  Such  right shall be in addition
to all other rights  and remedies  to which  Lender may be entitled  upon
Default.
DEFAULT.  Defaul  will occur if payment in  full is  not  made immediately
when due.
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES  ON DEFAULT.  If Default occurs under this Agreement,
at any time thereafter, Lender shall   have all the rights of a
secured party under  the New York  Uniform Commercial Code.  In  addition
and  without  limitation,  Lender may exercise any one or more of the
following  rights and remedies:
Accelerate Indebtedness.  Lender may declare the entire Indebtedness,
including any prepayment penalty which  Granter would be required
to pay,  immediately due and payable,  without notice of any kind to
Grantor.
Assemble Collateral.  Lender may require  Grantor to deliver to Lender
all  or any portion of the Collateral  and any and all  certificates
of title and other do uments relating to the Collateral.  Lender may
require Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available  to
Lender at a place to  be  designated  by Lender.  Lender also shall
have full  power to enter upon the property  of Grantor to take
possession of and remove the collateral.  If the Collateral contains
other goods not covered by this Agreement at the time of repossession,
Grantor agrees Lender may take such other goods,  provided that Lender
makes reasonable efforts to return them to Grantor after repossession.
Sell the Collateral.   Lender shall  have full power to sell,  lease,
transfer, or otherwise deal with the Collateral or proceeds thereof in
Lender's own name or that of Grantor.  Lender may sell the Collateral
at public auction or private sale.  Unless the Collateral threatens
to decline speedily in  value or is  of a type customarily  sold on a
recognized market,  Lender will give Grantor, and other persons as
required by law, reasonable  notice of the time and place of any public
sale,  or the time after which any private sale  or any other
disposition  of the Collateral is to be made.  However,  no  notice
need be provided to any person who,  after Event of Default occurs,
enters into  and authenticates an agreement waving  that person's
right to notification of sale.   The requirements of reasonable notice
shall  be met if such notice is given at least ten (10)  days before
the time of the sale or disposition.  All  expenses relating to the
disposition of the Collateral, including without limitation the
expenses of retaking,  holding,  insuring,  preparing for sale and
selling the Collateral (including  legal  fees and   costs),  shall
become a part of the Indebtedness secured by this Agreement and payable
from the proceeds of the disposition  of the Collateral, and shall
be payable on  demand,  with interest at the Note rate from date of
expenditure until repaid.
Appoint Receiver.   Lender shall  have the right to have a receiver
appointed  to take possession  of all or any part of the Collateral,
with  the power to protect and preserve the Collateral, to operate the
Collateral preceding foreclosure  or sale,   and to  collect the
rents from  the

Collateral  and  apply  the proceeds,  over and above the cost of
the receivership, against the Indebtedness. Lender's  right to the
appointment of a receiver shall exist  whether or not the apparent
value of the Collateral exceeds the Indebtednessby a substantial
amount.  The right to a receiver shall  be given to Lender
regardless of the solvency of Grantor and without any requirement
to give notice to Grantor.
Collect Revenues, Apply Accounts.  Lender, either itself or through
a receiver, may collect the payments, rents, income, and revenues from
the Collateral.  Lender may at any time in Lender's discretion transfer
any Collateral into Lender's  own name or that of Lender's nominee
and receive  the payments, rents, income, and revenues therefrom and
hold the same as security for  the Indebtednessor apply it to
payment of the Indebtedness in such order of preferenceas Lender may
determine.  Insofar as the Collateral consists of accounts,  general
intangibles, insurance  policies, instruments,  chattel paper, choses
in action,  or similar property,  Lender may demand, collect, receipt
for, settle,  compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose, or realize on
the Collateral as Lender may determine, whether  or not Indebtedness
or Collateral is  then due.  For these purposes, Lender may, on behalf
of and in the name of  Grantor,  receive,   open and dispose  of
mail addressed to Grantor;  change any address to which mail and
payments are to be sent; and endorse notes, checks, drafts, money
orders, documents of title, instruments and items pertaining to
payment, shipment,  or storage of any Collateral. To facilitate
collection,  Lender may notify ac ount  debtors and obligors on
any Collateralto makepaymentsdirectly to Lender.
Obtain  Deficiency.   If Lender chooses to sell any or all of the
Collateral,  Lender may obtain a judgment against Grantor for any
deficiency remaining on the Indebtedness due to Lender after
application of all amounts received from the exercise of the rights
provided  in this Agreement. Grantor shall  be liable for a
deficiency even if the transaction described in  this subsection
is  a sale of accounts or chattel paper.
Other Rights and Remedies. Lender shall have all the  rights and
remedies of a secured creditor under the provisions of the Uniform
Commercial Code, as may be amended from time to time.  In addition,
Lender shall have and may exercise any or all other rights and
remedies it may have available at law, in equity, or otherwise.
Election  of Remedies.  Except as  may be prohibited by applicable
law,  all of Lender's rights  and remedies,  whether  evidenced by
this Agreement, the Related Documents, or by any other writing,
shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently.
Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit
of any other remedy,  and an election to make expenditures or to
take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this

Lender's right  to declare a default and exercise  its remedies.
