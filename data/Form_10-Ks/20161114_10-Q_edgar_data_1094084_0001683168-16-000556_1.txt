NOTE A   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

A summary of the significant accounting
policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements follows. 

General   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of Telkonet, Inc. (the  Company ,  Telkonet ) have been prepared in accordance with
Rule S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  However,
the results from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated December 31, 2015 financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's
Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 

Business and Basis of Presentation   

Telkonet, formed in 1999 and incorporated
under the laws of the State of Utah, is made up of two synergistic business divisions, EcoSmart Energy Management Technology and
EthoStream High Speed Internet Access ( HSIA ) Network. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Telkonet Communications, Inc., and EthoStream LLC ( Ethostream ).
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The Company operates in one reportable
segment based on management s view of its business for purposes of evaluating performance and making operating decisions.
The Company utilizes shared services including but not limited to, human resources, payroll, finance, sales, support services,
as well as certain shared assets and sales, general and administrative costs. The Company s approach is to make operational
decisions and assess performance based on delivering products and services that together provide solutions to its customer base,
utilizing a functional management structure and shared services where possible. Based upon this business model, the chief operating
decision maker only reviews consolidated financial information. 

Liquidity and Financial Condition   

The Company reported a net loss of $944,701
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, had cash used in operating activities of $744,481, had an accumulated deficit of
$123,039,822 and a working capital surplus of $207,634 as of September 30, 2016. Since inception, the Company s primary sources
of ongoing liquidity for operations have come through private and public offerings of equity securities, and the issuance of various
debt instruments and asset-based lending.  

As discussed in Note G, the Series A preferred
stock became redeemable at the option of the preferred stock holders on November 19, 2014 and for a period of 180 days thereafter,
provided that at least 50% of the holders provide written notice to the Company requesting redemption. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, no redemption of the preferred stock occurred and any future redemption of the Series A or B preferred stock
would be entirely at the option of the Company. Furthermore, on February 17, 2016, an amendment to the revolving credit facility
with Heritage Bank of Commerce, a California state chartered bank ( Heritage Bank ) was executed extending the maturity
date of the revolving credit facility to September 30, 2018, unless earlier accelerated under the terms of the loan and security
agreement (the  Heritage Bank Loan Agreement ). This revolving credit facility is available for working capital and
other business purposes. The outstanding principal balance of the revolving credit facility bears interest at the Prime Rate plus
3.00%. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility was $1,011,771 and the remaining available
borrowing capacity was approximately $217,000. 

The Company s liquidity plan includes
reviewing options for raising additional capital including, but not limited to, asset-based or equity financing, private placements,
and/or disposition of assets.  Management believes that with additional financing, the Company will be able to fund required
working capital, research and development and marketing expenses necessary to promote revenue growth. However, any equity financing
may be dilutive to stockholders and any additional debt financing would increase expenses and may involve restrictive covenants.
While the Company has been successful in securing financing through September 30, 2018 with the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement to
provide adequate funding for working capital purposes, there is no assurance that obtaining additional or replacement financing,
if needed, will sufficiently fund future operations, repay existing debt or implement the Company s growth strategy. The
Company s failure to execute on this strategy may have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and
financial position.

Restricted Cash on Deposit   

The Company executes contracts with bonding
requirements and maintains this cash collateral on deposit for current and future projects. The amount is presented as restricted
cash on deposit on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of September 30,
2016, all projects requiring performance bonds were completed and the Company was released from the performance bonds.  The
outstanding   balance   as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 was zero and $31,277, respectively.  

Income (Loss) per Common Share   

The Company computes earnings per
share under ASC 260-10,  Earnings Per Share . Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed using the
treasury stock method, which assumes that the proceeds to be received on exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants
are used to repurchase shares of the Company at the average market price of the common shares for the year. Dilutive common
stock equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Company's outstanding stock options and warrants. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were 2,240,225 and 7,413,635 shares of common stock, underlying
options and warrants, respectively, and were excluded due to these instruments being anti-dilutive. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with United States of America (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make
certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Estimates are used when accounting for items and matters such as revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible accounts
receivable, inventory obsolescence, depreciation and amortization, long-lived and intangible asset valuations, impairment assessments,
taxes and related valuation allowance, income tax provisions, stock-based compensation, and contingencies. The Company believes
that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. 

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with ASC 740-10  Income Taxes.  Under this method, deferred income taxes (when required) are provided based
on the difference between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating losses at the
statutory rates enacted for future periods. The Company has a policy of establishing a valuation allowance when it is more likely
than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of its deferred income tax assets in the future. 

The Company adopted ASC 740-10-25, which
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, treatment
of interest and penalties, and disclosure of such positions. 

Revenue Recognition   

For revenue from product sales, the Company
recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 605-10,  Revenue Recognition  and ASC 605-10-S99 guidelines that require
that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery
has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria
(3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered
and the collectability of those amounts. Assuming all conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied, product revenue
is recognized when products are shipped and installation revenue is recognized when the services are completed. Provisions for
discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period
the related sales are recorded. The guidelines also address the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance
of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.

Multiple-Element Arrangements ( MEAs ): 
The Company accounts for contracts that have both product and installation under the MEAs guidance in ASC 605-25. Arrangements
under such contracts may include multiple deliverables, a combination of equipment and services. The deliverables included in the
MEAs are separated into more than one unit of accounting when (i) the delivered equipment has value to the customer on a stand-alone
basis, and (ii) delivery of the undelivered service element(s) is probable and substantially in the Company s control. Arrangement
consideration is then allocated to each unit, delivered or undelivered, based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting
based first on vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) if it exists, second on third-party evidence ( TPE )
if it exists, and third on estimated selling price ( ESP ) if neither VSOE or TPE exist. 

VSOE   In most instances, products are sold separately in stand-alone arrangements. Services are also sold separately through renewals of contracts with varying periods. The Company determines VSOE based on pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately, considering geographical, customer, and other economic or marketing variables, as well as renewal rates or stand-alone prices for the service element(s).   

TPE   If the Company cannot establish VSOE of selling price for a specific product or service included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company uses third-party evidence of selling price. The Company determines TPE based on sales of a comparable amount of similar product or service offered by multiple third parties considering the degree of customization and similarity of product or service sold.   

ESP   The estimated selling price represents the price at which the Company would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. When neither VSOE nor TPE exists for all elements, the Company determines ESP for the arrangement element based on sales, cost and margin analysis, as well as other inputs based on the Company s pricing practices. Adjustments for other market and Company-specific factors are made as deemed necessary in determining ESP.   

Under the estimated selling price method,
revenue is recognized in MEAs based on estimated selling prices for all of the elements in the arrangement, assuming all other
conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. To determine the estimated selling price, the Company establishes
the selling price for its products and installation services using the Company s established pricing guidelines, and the
proceeds are allocated between the elements and the arrangement. 

When MEAs include an element of customer
training, it is not essential to the functionality, efficiency or effectiveness of the MEA. Therefore the Company has concluded
that this obligation is inconsequential and perfunctory. As such, for MEAs that include training, customer acceptance of said training
is not deemed necessary in order to record the related revenue, but is recorded when the installation deliverable is fulfilled.
Historically, training revenues have not been significant. 

The Company provides call center support
services to properties installed by the Company and also to properties installed by other providers. In addition, the Company provides
the property with the portal to access the Internet. The Company receives monthly service fees from such properties for its services
and Internet access. The Company recognizes the service fee ratably over the term of the contract. The prices for these services
are fixed and determinable prior to delivery of the service. The fair value of these services is known due to objective and reliable
evidence from standalone executed contracts. The Company reports such revenues as recurring revenues. Deferred revenue
includes deferrals for the monthly support service fees and Internet access. Long-term deferred revenue represents support service
fees to be earned or provided beginning after September 30, 2017. Revenue recognized that has not yet been billed to a customer
results in an asset as of the end of the period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was $137,403 and $170,000
recorded within accounts receivable, respectively, related to revenue recognized that has not yet been billed. 

Guarantees and Product Warranties   

The Company records a liability for potential
warranty claims in cost of sales at the time of sale. The amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio
of claims to sales, the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim, new product introductions and
other factors. The products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year. In the event the Company determines
that its current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed its estimates, an adjustment to these reserves would be
charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December
31, 2015, the Company experienced returns of approximately 1% to 3% of materials included in the cost of sales. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded warranty liabilities in the amount of $77,310 and $66,555, respectively, using
this experience factor range.

NOTE B   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09
is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this
core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required
under existing U.S. GAAP. The guidance for this standard was initially effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, however in August 2015 the FASB delayed the effective date of
the standard for one full year. Companies will adopt the standard using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full
retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain
practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized
at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its
pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which it will
adopt the standard in 2018. 

In August 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ) which requires management to evaluate,
in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable) and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016 and thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending
adoption of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)
( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 requires inventory to be subsequently measured using the lower of cost and
net realizable value, thereby eliminating the market value approach. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling
prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is applied prospectively. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2015-11 on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-17, Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) ( ASU 2015-17 ), which
requires deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation
allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in the consolidated balance sheets. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 may be applied either
prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not believe
this guidance will have a material impact on the Company's future statement of operations or financial position. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ). The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to
record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified
as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into
after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ). The new standard provides
guidance on the classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows, such as contingent consideration payments
made in connection with a business combination and debt prepayment or extinguishment costs. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that fiscal year. When adopted, the new guidance will
be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated
financial statements.

The Company does not amortize goodwill. The
Company recorded goodwill in the amount of $8,796,430 as a result of the acquisition of EthoStream during the year ended December
31, 2007. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting units to which this
goodwill relates at least once a year or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
the fair value of the Company s reporting units below their carrying value. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation
methodology (income approach) to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Since acquisition, the Company has impaired $3,000,000
of goodwill for EthoStream. Consistent with previous interim reporting periods, the Company monitors qualitative and quantitative
factors, including internal projections, periodic forecasts, and actual results of the reporting unit. Based upon this interim
review, the Company does not believe that goodwill or its amortized identifiable intangible assets attributable to the EthoStream
reporting unit are impaired.

Revolving Credit Facility   

On September 30, 2014, the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiary, EthoStream, as co-borrowers (collectively, the  Borrowers ), entered into a loan and security
agreement (the  Heritage Bank Loan Agreement ), with Heritage Bank of Commerce, a California state chartered bank ( Heritage
Bank ), governing a new revolving credit facility in a principal amount not to exceed $2,000,000 (the  Credit Facility ).
Availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility from time to time is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the
Company s eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory each multiplied by an applicable advance rate, with an overall
limitation tied to the Company s eligible accounts receivable. The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement is available for working
capital and other general business purposes. The outstanding principal balance of the Credit Facility bears interest at the Prime
Rate plus 3.00%, which was 6.50% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. On October 9, 2014, as part of the Heritage Bank
Loan Agreement, Heritage Bank was granted a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of Telkonet common stock. The warrant has an exercise
price of $0.20 and expires October 9, 2021. On February 17, 2016, an amendment to the Credit Facility was executed extending the
maturity date to September 30, 2018, unless earlier accelerated under the terms of the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement.     

The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement also contains
financial covenants that place restrictions on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of liens and sale of assets.
The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Borrowers to maintain a minimum EBITDA level,
measured quarterly, and a minimum asset coverage ratio, measured monthly. A violation of any of these covenants could result in
an event of default under the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default or certain other customary
events of defaults, payment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility may be accelerated and Heritage Bank s commitment
to extend credit under the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement may be terminated. The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement contains other representations
and warranties, covenants, and other provisions customary to transactions of this nature. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was
in violation of a financial performance covenant. Heritage Bank granted a waiver of that violation on August 11, 2016. By waiving
the violation, Heritage Bank is not surrendering any of its other rights set forth in the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement. On October
27, 2016, an amendment to the Credit Facility was executed modifying the required minimum EBITDA level financial covenant as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the modified financial covenants.
The outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was $1,011,771 and $901,771 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
leaving an available borrowing base of approximately $217,000 and $532,700 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

NOTE G   PREFERRED STOCK  

Series A   

The Company has designated 215 shares
of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock ( Series A ). Each share of Series A is convertible, at the option
of the holder thereof, at any time, into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $0.363 per share. In the event
of a change of control (as defined in the purchase agreement with respect to the Series A), or at the holder s option, on
November 19, 2014 and for a period of 180 days thereafter, provided that at least 50% of the shares of Series A issued on the
Series A Original Issue Date remain outstanding as of November 19, 2014, and the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Series A provide written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Series A, the Company was required to redeem
the Series A for the purchase price of $5,000 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. By way of the redemption option
available to holders of the Company s Series A shares having expired on May 18, 2015 with no Series A holders requesting
redemption of their shares, the redemption feature at the option of the holders was eliminated, thereby, resulting in the reclassification
of $1,322,112 from temporary equity, which was classified as  redeemable preferred stock  in the Company s consolidated
balance sheets, to permanent equity during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Company has accrued dividends for Series A of zero and $36,707, and cumulative accrued dividends of $508,454 and $434,226 as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The accrued dividends have been charged to additional paid-in capital (since there is
a deficit in retained earnings) and an increase to the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and the net unpaid
accrued dividends been added to the carrying value of the preferred stock. 

Series B   

The Company has designated 538 shares of
preferred stock as Series B Preferred Stock ( Series B ). Each share of Series B is convertible, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time, into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.13 per share.  As
a result of the Series B conversions during the year ended December 31, 2013, the outstanding Series B shares are not redeemable
at the option of the holders. The Series B accrues dividends at an annual rate of 8% of the original purchase price, payable only
when, as, and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors. 

On August 4, 2010, the Company sold 267
shares of Series B with attached warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,134,626 shares of the Company s common stock at $0.13
per share. The Series B shares were sold at a price per share of $5,000 and each Series B share was convertible into approximately

preferred stock on the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2011, shareholders converted 45 preferred

were converted to, in aggregate, 10,423,067 shares of common stock. 

As
a result of the Series B conversions during the year ended December 31, 2013, fewer than 50% of the Series B shares issued on the
Series B original issuance date, August 4, 2010, remain outstanding, and the balance of the outstanding Series B shares will not
become redeemable at the option of the holders. The redemption feature at the option of the holders is eliminated, thereby, resulting
in the reclassification of $324,063 from temporary equity, which was classified as  redeemable preferred stock  in
the Company s consolidated balance sheets, to permanent equity during the year ended December 31, 2013.     

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company has accrued dividends for Series B of zero. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company has accrued dividends for Series B of zero and $10,921, and cumulative accrued dividends of $128,186 and $113,503 as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The accrued dividends have been charged to additional paid-in capital (since there is
a deficit in retained earnings) and the net unpaid accrued dividends been added to the carrying value of the preferred stock. 

Preferred stock carries certain preference
rights as detailed in the Company s Amended Articles of Incorporation related to both the payment of dividends and as to
payments upon liquidation in preference to any other class or series of capital stock of the Company. Liquidation preference of
the preferred stock is based on the following order: first, Series B with a preference value of $388,186 and second, Series A with
a preference value of $1,433,454. Both series of preferred stock are equal in their dividend preference over common stock.

The expected life of awards granted represents
the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The Company determines the expected life based on historical
experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules, exercise patterns and pre-vesting
and post-vesting forfeitures. The Company estimates the volatility of the Company s common stock based on the
calculated historical volatility of the Company s own common stock using the trailing 24 months of share price data prior
to the date of the award. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model
on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected
life of the award. The Company has not paid any cash dividends on the Company s common stock and does not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero
in the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record
share-based compensation for those awards that are expected to vest. In accordance with ASC 718-10, the Company adjusts share-based
compensation for changes to the estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. 

There were 300,000 and zero options granted
and no options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Total stock-based compensation
expense in connection with options granted to employees recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the

Litigation   

The Company is subject to legal proceedings
and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur,
the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
results of operations or liquidity. 

Sales Tax    

During 2012, the Company engaged a sales
tax consultant to assist in determining the extent of its potential sales tax exposure. Based upon this analysis, management determined
the Company had probable exposure for certain unpaid obligations, including interest and penalty, of approximately $1,100,000 including
and prior to the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company has approximately $243,000 and $230,000 accrued as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The Company continues to manage the liability
by establishing voluntary disclosure agreements (VDAs) with the applicable states, which establishes a maximum look-back period
and payment arrangements. However, if the aforementioned methods prove unsuccessful and the Company is examined or challenged by
taxing authorities, there exists possible exposure of an additional $20,000, not including any applicable interest and penalties. 

Prior to 2016, the Company successfully
executed and paid in full VDAs in thirty one states totaling approximately $695,000 and is current with the subsequent filing requirements. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company executed five VDA s totaling approximately $70,000. 

As of September 30, 2016, the state of
Wisconsin is performing a sales and use tax audit covering the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015. The Company

amount as of September 30, 2016.

regarding strategic growth initiatives, growth opportunities and management s expectations regarding orders and financial
results for the remainder of 2016 and future periods. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and current
assumptions which management believes are reasonable. However, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from any future results encompassed within the forward-looking statements. Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include those risks affecting the Company s business as described in the
Company s filings with the SEC, including the current reports on Form 8-K, which factors are incorporated herein by reference.
The Company expressly disclaims a duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or other occurrences. 

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires the Company
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates significant estimates used in preparing its condensed consolidated
financial statements including those related to revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory
obsolescence, depreciation and amortization, long-lived and intangible asset valuations, impairment assessments, taxes and related
valuation allowance, income tax provisions, stock-based compensation, and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience, underlying run rates and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. The following are critical judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition   

For revenue from product sales, the Company
recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 605-10,  Revenue Recognition  and ASC 605-10-S99 guidelines that require
that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery
has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria
(3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered
and the collectability of those amounts. Assuming all conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied, product revenue
is recognized when products are shipped and installation revenue is recognized when the services are completed. Provisions for
discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period
the related sales are recorded. The guidelines also address the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance
of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. 

Multiple-Element Arrangements ( MEAs ): 
The Company accounts for contracts that have both product and installation under the MEAs guidance in ASC 605-25. Arrangements
under such contracts may include multiple deliverables, a combination of equipment and services. The deliverables included in the
MEAs are separated into more than one unit of accounting when (i) the delivered equipment has value to the customer on a stand-alone
basis, and (ii) delivery of the undelivered service element(s) is probable and substantially in the Company s control. Arrangement
consideration is then allocated to each unit, delivered or undelivered, based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting
based first on vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) if it exists, second on third-party evidence ( TPE )
if it exists, and third on estimated selling price ( ESP ) if neither VSOE or TPE exist. 

VSOE   In most instances, products are sold separately in stand-alone arrangements. Services are also sold separately through renewals of contracts with varying periods. The Company determines VSOE based on pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately, considering geographical, customer, and other economic or marketing variables, as well as renewal rates or stand-alone prices for the service element(s).   

TPE   If the Company cannot establish VSOE of selling price for a specific product or service included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company uses third-party evidence of selling price. The Company determines TPE based on sales of a comparable amount of similar product or service offered by multiple third parties considering the degree of customization and similarity of product or service sold.   

ESP   The estimated selling price represents the price at which the Company would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. When neither VSOE nor TPE exists for all elements, the Company determines ESP for the arrangement element based on sales, cost and margin analysis, as well as other inputs based on the Company s pricing practices. Adjustments for other market and Company-specific factors are made as deemed necessary in determining ESP.   

Under the estimated selling price method,
revenue is recognized in MEAs based on estimated selling prices for all of the elements in the arrangement, assuming all other
conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. To determine the estimated selling price, the Company establishes
the selling price for its products and installation services using the Company s established pricing guidelines, and the
proceeds are allocated between the elements and the arrangement.  

When MEAs include an element of customer
training, it is not essential to the functionality, efficiency or effectiveness of the MEA. Therefore the Company has concluded
that this obligation is inconsequential and perfunctory. As such, for MEAs that include training, customer acceptance of said training
is not deemed necessary in order to record the related revenue, but is recorded when the installation deliverable is fulfilled.
Historically, training revenues have not been significant.  

The Company provides call center support
services to properties installed by the Company and also to properties installed by other providers. In addition, the Company provides
the property with the portal to access the Internet. The Company receives monthly service fees from such properties for its services
and Internet access. The Company recognizes the service fee ratably over the term of the contract. The prices for these services
are fixed and determinable prior to delivery of the service. The fair value of these services is known due to objective and reliable
evidence from standalone executed contracts. The Company reports such revenues as recurring revenues. Deferred revenue
includes deferrals for the monthly support service fees and Internet access. Long-term deferred revenue represents support service
fees to be earned or provided beginning after September 30, 2017. Revenue recognized that has not yet been billed to a customer
results in an asset as of the end of the period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $137,403 and $170,000
recorded within accounts receivable, respectively, related to revenue recognized that has not yet been billed, respectively. 

Total revenues
do not include sales tax as the Company is a pass through conduit for collection and remitting sales tax.

pronouncements and their effect on the Company, see  New Accounting Pronouncements  in Note B of the Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 

EBITDA   

Management believes that certain non-GAAP
financial measures may be useful to investors in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current
results and results in prior operating periods. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted
EBITDA ) is a metric used by management and frequently used by the financial community and investors. Adjusted EBITDA provides
insight to investors into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization along with stock-based compensation can differ greatly between organizations as a result of
differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the measures used for determining our debt covenant
compliance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period. While management
believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our
GAAP financial results. Adjusted EBITDA is not, and should not be considered, an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss)
from operations, or any other measure for determining operating performance of liquidity, as determined under GAAP. In assessing
the overall health of its business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company excluded items
in the following general category described below: 

Stock-based compensation: The Company believes that because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation and the assumptions and estimates involved in those determinations, the exclusion of non-cash stock-based compensation enhances the ability of management and investors to understand the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation on our operating results. Further, the Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation expense allows for a more transparent comparison of its financial results to the previous period.   

RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO
ADJUSTED EBITDA  

  (Unaudited)  

Revenues   

The table below outlines product versus
recurring revenues for comparable periods: 

Product Revenue   

Product revenue principally arises from
the sale and installation of EcoSmart energy management platform, SmartGrid and High Speed Internet Access equipment. The EcoSmart
Suite of products consists of thermostats, sensors, controllers, wireless networking products switches, outlets and a control platform.
The HSIA product suite consists of gateway servers, switches and access points. The Company markets and sells to the hospitality,
education, healthcare and government/military markets.  

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, product revenue decreased by 19% and increased 10%, respectively, when compared to the prior year periods.  Product
revenue in 2016 includes approximately $6.30 million attributed to the sale and installation of the Company s EcoSmart Platform
products, and approximately $2.80 million for the sale and installation of HSIA products. For the three month comparison,
the revenue decrease was driven by a $0.27 million decrease in the Multiple Dwelling Unit ( MDU ) market, a $0.25 million
decrease in the education market, a $0.19 million decrease in the hospitality market offset by a $0.13 million increase in the
government/military market. For the nine month comparison, the composition of our product revenue changed, EcoSmart installations
increased by $1.10 million offset by a $0.20 million decrease in HSIA installations. Revenue growth was driven by a $1.04 million
increase in the hospitality market, a $0.16 million increase in the military/government market and a $0.12 million increase in
the MDU market offset by a $0.47 million decrease in the education market compared to the prior year periods, respectively. 

Recurring Revenue    

Recurring revenue is primarily attributed
to recurring services. The Company recognizes revenue ratably over the service month for monthly support revenues and defers revenue
for annual support services over the term of the service period. The recurring revenue consists primarily of HSIA support services,
and Telkonet s EcoCare service and support program. Advertising revenue, which is approximately 1% of the Company s
support revenue, is based on impression-based statistics for a given period from customer site visits to the Company s login
portal page under the terms of advertising agreements entered into with third-parties. A component of the Company s recurring
revenue is derived from fees, less payback costs, associated with less than 1% of its hospitality customers who do not internally
manage guest-related, internet transactions. 

Recurring revenue includes approximately
2,300 hotels in the Company s broadband network portfolio. The Company currently supports approximately 234,000
HSIA rooms with approximately 8.0 million monthly users. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, recurring
revenue increased by 6% when compared to the prior year periods. For the three month comparison, the positive variance
in recurring revenue was attributed to a $0.06 million increase associated with the Company s EcoCare service and support
program for the EcoSmart Suite of products. For the nine month comparison, the variance in recurring revenue was partially attributed
to a $0.14 million increase associated with the Company s EcoCare service and support program for the EcoSmart Suite of products.
Support revenue from the Company s HSIA support services added approximately $0.04 million compared to the prior year. 

Cost of Sales   

Costs of Product Sales   

Costs of product sales include equipment
and installation labor related to the sale of SmartGrid and broadband networking equipment, including EcoSmart technology and Telkonet
iWire. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, product costs decreased by 12% and increased by 15% compared
to the prior year periods. For the three month comparison, the decrease was attributed to material costs of $0.07 million, outside
contractor expenses of $0.01 million, $0.05 million in travel expenses, a change of $0.04 million related to inventory valuation
and a decrease of $0.04 in salary and benefits offset by an increase in freight charges of $0.03 million. For the nine month comparison,
the increase included a $0.46 million increase for materials, $0.29 million for outside contractor services, $0.09 million for
freight offset by a $0.09 decrease related to inventory valuation, a $0.03 million decrease in travel and a $0.06 million decrease
in salaries and wages. 

Costs of Recurring Revenue   

Recurring costs are comprised of support
wages and telecommunication services for the Company s Customer Service department. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, recurring costs increased by 10% and 9% compared to the prior year periods. Both three and nine month variances
are attributed to an increase in telecommunications and support payroll costs. 

Gross Profit   

Gross Profit on Product Revenue   

Gross profit for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 27% and increased by 5% when compared to the prior year periods. The actual gross profit
percentage decreased by 4% during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. The variance can be partially attributed to
a $0.10 decrease for a HSIA product rebate from 2015 to 2016. HSIA product costs increased approximately 8% in for the three months
ended 2016 from 2015. Gross profit percentages for the nine month comparable periods remained almost unchanged, 46% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Gross Profit on Recurring Revenue   

The gross profit associated with recurring
revenue increased by 4% and 5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the prior year periods. While
the dollar value variance increased, actual gross profit percentages remained relatively unchanged from 75% and 76% for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the 76% and 77% for the comparable prior year periods. 

Operating Expenses   

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, operating expenses increased by 15% and 22% when compared to the prior year periods as outlined below. 

Research and Development   

Research and development costs are related
to both present and future products and are expensed in the period incurred.  Current research and development costs
are associated with product development and integration. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, research and
development costs increased 15% and 17% when compared to the prior year periods. For the three month comparison the variance is
due to an increase in consulting fees of $0.03 million, $0.02 million charge for certification and product inspection. For the
nine month comparison the variance is due to an increase in expenditures for salary, wages and consulting of $0.14 million and
certification expenses for new products of $0.05 million. Additional personnel were needed for developing the Company s new
products and software applications. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses increased over the prior year periods by 16% and 23%, respectively.
For the three month comparison, the variance was due to a $0.15 million increase in sales and use tax expense. The state of Wisconsin
is performing a sales and use tax audit covering the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015. The Company estimates
the audit will result in approximately $0.1 million in additional use tax and interest. During the three months ended September
30, 2015, the Company decreased the sales and use tax liability $0.05 million due to VDA settlements. Payroll, benefit and consulting
costs increased $0.06 million. Legal and bad debt expense both increased $0.02 million. Advertising and marketing expenses increased
$0.01 million offset by a decrease of $0.03 million in director and banking fees. 

For the nine month comparison, $0.29 million
of the variance is attributed to the costs associated with the contested proxy contest as discussed in detail in the June 30, 2016
Form 10-Q. Also contributing to the variance were salary, benefits, consulting and temporary staffing of $0.40 million, due to
the addition of a Controller, two Channel Account Managers and an accounting staff position. $0.15 million for aforementioned sales
and use tax, an $0.08 million increase for a discretionary bonus awarded to various staff, $0.05 million for legal fees, commissions
of $0.04 million, $0.06 million in public company fees, $0.04 million in marketing and trade show expense, $0.04 million for accounting
fees and $0.02 million in computer hardware expense. These increases were offset by a decrease of $0.05 million in director and
banking fees. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The Company has financed its operations
since inception primarily through private and public offerings of the Company s equity securities, the issuance of various
debt instruments and asset based lending, and cash generated from operations. 

Working Capital   

Working capital increased by $240,946 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $33,312
at December 31, 2015 to a working capital surplus of $207,634 at September 30, 2016.  

Business Loan   

On September 11, 2009, the Company entered
into a Loan Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000 with the Wisconsin Department of Commerce. The outstanding
principal balance bears interest at the annual rate of 2%. Payment of interest and principal is to be made in the following manner:
(a) payment of any and all interest that accrues from the date of disbursement commenced on January 1, 2010 and continued on the
first day of each consecutive month thereafter through and including December 31, 2010; (b) commencing on January 1, 2011 and continuing
on the first day of each consecutive month thereafter through and including November 1, 2016, the Company is required to pay equal
monthly installments of $4,426; followed by a final installment on December 1, 2016 which shall include all remaining principal,
accrued interest and other amounts owed by the Company to the Department under the Loan Agreement. The Company may prepay amounts
outstanding under the Loan Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Loan Agreement was secured by substantially
all of the Company s assets. On September 24, 2014, the Department signed a subordination agreement of all the Company s
security interests. The proceeds from this loan were used for the working capital requirements of the Company. The Loan Agreement
contains covenants which required, among other things, that the Company keep and maintain 75 existing full-time positions and create
and fill 35 additional full-time positions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by December 31, 2012. On June 18, 2012, the Department agreed
to permanently waive all penalties associated with the Company s noncompliance with this covenant. The outstanding borrowings
under the agreement as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $13,476 and $52,579, respectively. 

Promissory Note   

On March 4, 2011, the Company sold all
its Series 5 PLC product line assets to Wisconsin-based Dynamic Ratings, Inc. ( Purchaser ) under an asset purchase
agreement ( APA ). Per the APA, the Company signed an unsecured promissory note (the  Note ) due to Purchaser
in the aggregate principal amount of $700,000. The outstanding principal balance bore interest at a rate of 6% and was originally
due on March 31, 2014. As a result of an amendment effective April 30, 2013, the maturity date was changed to January 1, 2016.
 The principal balance of the Note as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was zero and $40,761,
respectively.  

Kross Promissory Note   

On August 4, 2016, the Board of
Directors authorized the Company to reimburse Peter T. Kross ( Mr. Kross ), $161,075 for expenses incurred
related to his successful contested proxy. Effective June 27, 2016, Mr. Kross is a director of the Company and considered a
related party. On August 30, 2016, Mr. Kross accepted an unsecured promissory note ( Kross Note ) for $161,075 from
the Company. The outstanding principal balance bears interest at the annual rate of 3.00%. Payment of interest and principal
began on September 1, 2016 and will continue monthly on the first day of each month thereafter through and including June 1,
2017; the Company is required to pay equal monthly installments of $16,330 which includes all remaining principal and accrued
interest owed by the Company to Mr. Kross under the Kross Note. The Company may prepay in advance any unpaid principal or
interest due under the Kross Note without premium or penalty. The principal balance of the Kross Note as of September 30,
2016 was $145,147. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made principal and interest
payments of $16,330 to Mr. Kross. 

Revolving Credit Facility   

On September 30, 2014, the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiary, EthoStream, as co-borrowers (collectively, the  Borrowers ), entered into a loan and
security agreement with Heritage Bank of Commerce, a California state chartered bank ( Heritage Bank ) (the  Heritage
Bank Loan Agreement ), governing a new revolving credit facility in a principal amount not to exceed $2,000,000 (the  Credit
Facility ). Availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility from time to time is subject to a borrowing base calculation
based on the Company s eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory each multiplied by an applicable advance rate,
with an overall limitation tied to the Company s eligible accounts receivable. The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement is available
for working capital and other lawful general corporate purposes. The outstanding principal balance of the Credit Facility bears
interest at the Prime Rate plus 3.00%, which was 6.50% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. On October 9, 2014, as part
of the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement, Heritage Bank was granted a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of Telkonet common stock.
The warrant has an exercise price of $0.20 and expires October 9, 2021. On February 17, 2016, an amendment to the Credit Facility
was executed extending the maturity date to September 30, 2018, unless earlier accelerated under the terms of the Heritage Bank
Loan Agreement. 

The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement also contains
financial covenants that place restrictions on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of liens and sale of assets.
The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Borrowers to maintain a minimum EBITDA level,
measured quarterly, and a minimum asset coverage ratio, measured monthly. A violation of any of these covenants could result in
an event of default under the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default or certain other customary
events of defaults, payment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility may be accelerated and Heritage Bank s commitment
to extend credit under the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement may be terminated. The Heritage Bank Loan Agreement contains other representations
and warranties, covenants, and other provisions customary to transactions of this nature. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was
in violation of a financial performance covenant. Heritage Bank granted a waiver of that violation on August 11, 2016. By waiving
the violation, Heritage Bank is not surrendering any of its other rights set forth in the Heritage Bank Loan Agreement. On October
27, 2016, an amendment to the Credit Facility was executed modifying the required minimum EBITDA level financial covenant as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the modified financial covenants.
The outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was $1,011,771 and $901,771 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
leaving an available borrowing base of approximately $217,000 and $532,700 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Cash Flow Analysis   

Cash used in continuing operations was $744,481
and $424,881 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, our primary capital
needs included costs incurred to increase energy management sales, inventory procurement, and managing current liabilities. The
working capital changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily related to an approximately $110,000 decrease
in accounts receivable, a $555,000 increase in inventory, a $513,000 decrease in accounts payable offset by a $91,000 increase
in deferred revenue, a $44,000 increase in customer deposits and a $353,000 increase in accrued liabilities and expenses.
The primary working capital change during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was related to an approximate increase of $923,000
in accounts receivable, a $129,000 decrease in inventory, a $181,000 increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets offset
by $130,000 increase in accounts payable and a $186,000 increase in accrued liabilities and expenses. Accounts receivable fluctuates
based on the negotiated billing terms with customers and collections. We purchase inventory based on forecasts and orders, and
when those forecasts and orders change, the amount of inventory may also fluctuate. Accounts payable fluctuates with changes in
inventory levels, volume of inventory purchases, and negotiated supplier and vendor terms. 

Cash used in investing activities was $2,352
and cash provided by investing activities was $25,388 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased $33,629 of computer equipment. This asset will be depreciated over
its respective estimated useful life. Restricted cash of $31,277 related to a bonding requirement was released during the period
once the performance bonds were cancelled.  

Cash provided by financing activities was
$707,637 and $367,124 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, 5,211,542 warrants were exercised for an aggregate of 5,211,542 shares of the Company s common stock at $0.13 per
share. These warrants were originally granted to shareholders of the April 8, 2011 Series B preferred stock issuance. Total proceeds
received were $677,501. Cash used in financing activities to repay indebtedness was $79,864 and cash proceeds from the line of
credit were $110,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash used in financing activities to repay indebtedness was
$228,943, shareholders exercised 2,019,236 warrants at $0.13 resulting in proceeds of $262,500 and cash borrowed on the line of
credit was $333,567 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

We are working to manage our current liabilities
while we continue to make changes in operations to improve our cash flow and liquidity position. 

Management expects that global economic
conditions, in particular the decreasing price of energy, along with competition will continue to present a challenging operating
environment through 2017; therefore working capital management will continue to be a high priority for 2017. The Company s
estimated cash requirements for our operations for the next 12 months is not anticipated to differ significantly from our present
cash requirements for our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

The Company has no material off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Acquisition or Disposition of Property
and Equipment   

The Company does not anticipate any significant
purchases of property or equipment during the next twelve months, other than computer equipment and peripherals to be used in the
Company s day-to-day operations. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company performed
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Due to the lack
of a segregation of duties and failure to implement accounting controls, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.  

The Company is subject to legal proceedings
and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business.  Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements
may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.  

There have been no material changes to
risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 in response to Item 1A

Rate  ):  

a.       The Applicable Rate

2.       Principle

June 1, 2017, Maker shall make monthly payments of principle and interest in the fixed amount of $16,329.79 (the   F ixed
Payments  ).  The Fixed Payments are calculated based on a level ten month amortization of the full initial principal
balance of $161,074.79, using the Applicable Rate of 3% per annum. 

3.       Subordination.
 The Holder acknowledges that this Promissory Note represents and unsecured obligation of Maker. The Holder further agrees that

4.       Compounding
of Interest.  Any required interest payments not timely made hereunder, shall be added to the principal balance 20 days after
the due date. Thereafter, interest shall accrue on the revised principal balance, including the defaulted interest payment(s). 

6.       Manner
of Payment.  All payments of principal and interest on this Note shall be made by immediately available funds to such place
as Holder shall designate to Maker. If any payment of principal or interest on this Note is due on a day which is not a business
day in the State of Wisconsin, such payment shall be due on the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall
be taken into account in calculating the amount of interest payable under this Note. 

7.       Prepayment.
 The unpaid principal and interest due under this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. 

8.       Default.
 The occurrence of any one or more of the following events with respect to Maker shall constitute an event of default hereunder
 (  Event of Default  ):

10.       Remedies.
 If an Event of Default occurs, Holder may, at its option and by written notice to Maker, declare the entire unpaid principal
balance of this Note, together with all accrued interest thereon, immediately due and payable. Failure by Holder to exercise the

the occurrence of any subsequent Event of Default. Holder may use any and all remedies in law and equity to enforce and collect
the amount owed under this Note and Maker shall be responsible for Holder's reasonable costs of enforcement and collection, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorney fees. 

11.       Waiver;

shall preclude other or further exercise thereof; or the exercise of any other right. All rights and remedies hereunder or afforded
by law shall be cumulative and shall be available to Holder until the principal amount of and all interest on this Note have been
paid in full. No modification, waiver, estoppel, amendment, discharge or change of this Note shall be valid unless it is in writing
