  1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Organization  
   
 Nutra Pharma Corp. ( Nutra Pharma ), is a holding company that owns intellectual property and operates in the biotechnology industry. Nutra Pharma incorporated under the laws of the state of California on February 1, 2000, under the original name of Exotic-Bird.com. 
   
 Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ReceptoPharm, Inc. ( ReceptoPharm ), Nutra Pharma conducts drug discovery research and development activities. In October 2009, Nutra Pharma launched its first consumer product called Cobroxin   , an over-the-counter pain reliever designed to treat moderate to severe chronic pain. In May 2010, Nutra Pharma launched its second consumer product called Nyloxin   , an over-the-counter pain reliever that is a stronger version of Cobroxin    and is designed to treat severe chronic pain. In December 2014, we launched Pet Pain-Away, an over-the-counter pain reliever designed to treat pain in cats and dogs. 
   
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  
   
 The Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial statements and notes are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not contain certain information included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal, recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
 The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements include the results of Nutra Pharma and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Designer Diagnostics Inc. and ReceptoPharm (collectively  the Company ,  us ,  we  or  our ). We operate as one reportable segment. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
  Liquidity and Going Concern  
   
 Our Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplate the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have experienced recurring, significant losses from operations, and have an accumulated deficit of $52,284,555 at September 30, 2016. In addition, we had respective working capital and stockholders  deficits at September 30, 2016 of $3,966,190 and $52,284,555, respectively.   
   
 There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern which is contingent upon our ability to secure additional financing, increase ownership equity and attain profitable operations. In addition, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered in established markets and the competitive environment in which we operate. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we do not have sufficient cash to sustain our operations for the next year and will require additional financing in order to execute our operating plan and continue as a going concern. Since our sales are not currently adequate to fund our operations, we continue to rely principally on debt and equity funding; however proceeds from such funding have not been sufficient to execute our business plan. Our plan is to attempt to secure adequate funding until sales of our pain products are adequate to fund our operations. We cannot predict whether additional financing will be available, and/or whether any such funding will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form. In the event that these financing sources do not materialize, or if we are unsuccessful in increasing our revenues and profits, we will be unable to implement our current plans for expansion, repay our obligations as they become due and continue as a going concern. 
   
 The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the  

7 

financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Significant estimates include our ability to continue as going concern, the recoverability of inventories and long-lived assets, and the valuation of stock-based compensation and certain debt and warrant liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which would be recorded in the period in which they become known.  
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 In general, we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Provision for sales returns is estimated based on our historical return experience. Revenue is presented net of returns and allowances for returns.  
   
 The Company collects 100% of the cash proceeds from the sale of its product by its distributor, remits a portion of the cash proceeds received back to the distributor and records the sale on a net basis. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company collected $178,357 in gross receipts and recorded $138,556 as net sales. 
   
  Accounting for Shipping and Handling Costs  
   
 The Company records shipping and handling costs incurred in cost of sales. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
   
  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
   
 The Company grants credit without collateral to its customers based on the Company s evaluation of a particular customer s credit worthiness. In addition, allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for potential credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of the Company s periodic credit evaluations of its customers  financial condition. Accounts receivable are written off after collection efforts have been deemed to be unsuccessful. Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts, while subsequent recoveries are netted against the provision for doubtful accounts expense. The Company generally does not charge interest on accounts receivable. 
   
 Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts.  
   
  Inventories   
   
 Inventories, which are stated at the lower of average cost or market, and consist of packaging materials, finished products, and raw venom that is utilized to make the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient). The raw unprocessed venom has an indefinite life for use. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand.  If necessary it records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on its estimates of component obsolescence, product demand and production requirements. Write-downs are charged to cost of goods sold.  We performed evaluations of our inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and determined no allowances need to be recorded. 
   
  Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk  
   
 Our financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, loans payable, due to officers and derivative financial instruments. Other than certain warrant and convertible instruments (derivative financial instruments) and liabilities to related parties (for which it was impracticable to estimate fair value due to uncertainty as to when they will be satisfied and a lack of similar type transactions in the marketplace), we believe the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values because they are short term in nature or payable on demand. Our derivative financial instruments are carried at a measured fair value. 
   
 Balances in various cash accounts may at times exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were two customers that accounted for 23.5% and 11.1% of the total revenues, respectively.  
   
  Derivative Financial Instruments  
   
 The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. Management evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded  

8 

derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. For embedded derivatives, the Company uses a Dilution-Adjusted Black-Scholes method to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
   
  Convertible Debt  
   
 The Company bifurcates the embedded derivative element in convertible debt which contain conversion features which are not considered to be conventional convertible debt.  The convertible debt is recorded at the bifurcated amount after reducing the proceeds for the liability related to the embedded call provision which is accounted for separately in the accompanying balance sheets.  After recording the initial amount of the debt, the discount related to the bifurcated embedded derivative is amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the debt with the resulting debt discount being accreted over the term of the note.   
   
  Property and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets   
   
 Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major improvements and additions are added to property and equipment, while replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not extend the useful lives are expensed. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of 3   7 years. 
   
 Property and equipment consists of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

We review our long-lived assets for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. At September 30, 2016, we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets are recoverable. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $6,421 and $9,091, respectively. 
   
  Advertising  
   
 All advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising costs were approximately $2,834 and $2,216 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 We compute income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC Topic 740 ). Under ASC Topic 740, deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Also, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Temporary differences between financial and tax reporting arise primarily from the use of different methods to record bad debts and /or sales returns, and inventory reserves.  
   
 On an annual basis, we evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns to determine if they are more than likely to be sustained if the taxing authority examines the respective position.  As of September 30, 2016, we do not believe we have a need to record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or provisions for interest or penalties related to such positions. 

9 

Since inception, we have been subject to tax by both federal and state taxing authorities. Until the respective statutes of limitations expire (which may be as much as 20 years while we have unused net operation losses), we are subject to income tax audits in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The Company s 2012 to 2015 tax returns are subject to examination by Internal Revenue Services and State Taxing Agency s. 
   
 On July 18, 2015, the Company received a notice of penalty charge of $35,296 from IRS for failure to file Forms W-2 for tax period ended at December 31, 2011. During February 2016, the Company signed a payment agreement to pay the penalty. The installment payments started on October 28, 2016. 
   
  Stock-Based Compensation  
   
 We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation  (ASC Topic 718). ASC Topic 718, which requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the financial statements over the respective service periods. It establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. The statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment transactions. 
   
  Net Loss Per Share  
   
 Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. During periods in which we incur losses, common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered, as their effect would be anti-dilutive or have no effect on earnings per share. Any common shares issued as of a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants would come from newly issued common shares from our remaining authorized shares. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the following items were not included in dilutive loss as the effect is anti-dilutive: 

Reclassifications  
   
 Certain amounts in the 2015 Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.   
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 In April 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Interest    Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , is to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. For public companies, the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We have adopted the provisions of this ASU for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 In May 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-07,  F air Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)   removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A reporting entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented. The retrospective approach requires that an investment for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient be removed from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented in an entity s financial statements. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

10 

In June 2015,  FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-10,   Technical Corrections and Improvements  covers a wide range of Topics in the Codification.  The amendments represent changes to clarify the Codification, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Additionally, some of the amendments will make the Codification easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving the presentation of guidance in the Codification.  Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this ASU. The amendments in this ASU that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the issuance of this ASU. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
  In August 2015,  FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   defers the effective date ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
  In September 2015,  FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this Update require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this Update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this Update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606.

  2.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
   
 Certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 are measured in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820-10-05,  Fair Value Measurements . FASB ASC Topic 820-10-05 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities as well as for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. 
   
 The statement requires fair value measurement be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level 1:  
   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
  
   Level 2:  
   Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs which are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and 
  
   Level 3:  
   Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e. supported by little or no market activity). 

The following table summarizes our financial instruments measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following table shows the changes in fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for the warrants: 

(1)   The gain or loss related to the revaluation of our warrant liability is included in  Change in fair value of derivatives  in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

 In the evaluation of these financing arrangements, the Company concluded that these conversion features did not meet the conditions set forth in current accounting standards for equity classification. Since equity classification is not available for the conversion feature, it requires bifurcation and liability classification, at fair value. The Company also concluded that the Default Put required bifurcation because, while puts on debt instruments are generally considered clearly and closely related to the host, the Default Put is indexed to certain events that are not associated with the convertible note payable. 
   
 The Company elected to account for these hybrid contracts under the guidance of ASC 815-15-25-4.  The fair value has been defined as the common stock equivalent value, enhanced by the fair value of the default put plus the present value of the coupon. 
   
 The holder of this convertible note has substantial rights and protections regarding dilution if certain events, including a default were to occur. There are a number of events that could trigger a default, including but not limited to failure to pay principal or interest, failure to issue shares under the conversion feature, breach of covenants, breach of representations and warranties, appointment of a receiver or trustee, judgments, bankruptcy, delisting of common stock, failure to comply with the exchange act, liquidation, cessation of operations, failure to maintain assets, material financial statement restatement, reverse split of borrowers stock, etc. In the event of these events the lender may be entitled to receive significant amounts of additional stock above the amounts for conversion.  
   
 Furthermore, there are additional events that could cause the lender to be due additional shares of common stock above and beyond the shares due from a conversion. Some of these events include, but are not limited to a merger or consolidation of the Company, dividend distribution or spin off, dilutive issuances of the Company s stock, etc. If the lender receives additional shares of the Company s commons stock due to any of the foregoing events or for other reasons, then this may have an extremely dilutive effect on the shareholders of the Company. Such dilution would likely result in a significant drop in the per share price of the Company s common stock. The potential dilutive nature of this note presents a very high degree of risk to the Company and its shareholders.

   Litigation   
   
  Patricia Meding, et. al. v. ReceptoPharm, Inc. f/k/a Receptogen, Inc.  
   
 On June 1, 2015, ReceptoPharm entered into a settlement agreement with Patricia Meding, a former officer and shareholder of ReceptoPharm.  The settlement relates to a lawsuit filed by Ms. Meding against ReceptoPharm (Patricia Meding, et. al. v. ReceptoPharm, Inc. f/k/a Receptogen, Inc., Index No.: 18247/06, New York Supreme Court, Queens County) in which she claimed to own certain shares of ReceptoPharm stock and claimed to be owed amounts on a series of promissory notes allegedly executed in 2001 and 2002.  
   
 The settlement agreement executed on June 1, 2015 provides that ReceptoPharm will pay Ms. Meding a total of $360,000 over 35 months. The first payment of $20,000 was made on July 1, 2015. A second payment of $20,000 was made on August 17, 2015 with 32 subsequent monthly $10,000 payments due on the 15th of every month thereafter. To date, ReceptoPharm has made all monthly payments due under the agreement.  In the event of default on any of the payments due under the settlement agreement, the settlement amount would increase by an additional $200,000.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued the legal settlement amount at present value of $172,260 and an additional contingency of $200,000. The settlement agreement is personally guaranteed by Rik Deitsch, our CEO. 
   
  Liquid Packaging Resources, Inc. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. and Erik  Rik  Deitsch   
   
 On April 21, 2011, Nutra Pharma Corp. and its CEO, Erik Deitsch, were named as defendants in  Liquid Packaging Resources, Inc. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. and Erik  Rik  Deitsch , Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, Civil Action No. 2011-CV-199562. Liquid Packaging Resources, Inc. ( LPR ) claimed that Nutra Pharma Corp. and Mr. Deitsch, directly or through other companies, placed orders with LPR that required LPR to purchase components from third parties. LPR sought reimbursement for those third party expenses in the amount of not less than $359,826.85 plus interest. LPR also sought punitive damages in the amount of not less than $500,000 and attorney's fees. 

27 

Mr. Deitsch and Nutra Pharma Corp. then removed the action to the United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Civil Action No. 11-CV-01663-ODE. After removal, LPR amended the Complaint to assert that Nutra Pharma Corp. and Mr. Deitsch were the alter egos of the alleged other companies through whom the subject orders were placed and therefore should be considered one and the same. Mr. Deitsch and Nutra Pharma Corp.  moved to dismiss the Complaint on several grounds including statute of frauds, failure to state a claim, and jurisdiction (only for Mr. Deitsch). Mr. Deitsch and Nutra Pharma Corp. believe the suit is without merit. 
   
 After September 30, 2011, at LPR's request, the parties mediated the dispute before LPR responded to the Motion to Dismiss. At the mediation, the parties worked out an agreement whereby Nutra Pharma Corp. would purchase from LPR the components LPR purchased from third parties at an amount slightly less than the principal amount of the suit and on terms acceptable to us. The agreed price was $350,000 payable over 7 months in equal $50,000 amounts. This agreement was reached by us because it provided tangible value in exchange for the purchase price rather than incurring the expense of litigation, which would likely be substantial and not recouped. While Nutra Pharma Corp.  had counterclaims we could assert, we believe this was a practical resolution. The settlement allowed us to take possession of the components prior to full payment and, in exchange, provided security to LPR in the form of our stock valued at $400,000 at the time of issuance. The stock can only be sold in event of a default of the payment schedule. The litigation was dismissed in August of 2011. We made the August, September and November payments (totaling $150,000) in a timely fashion. We were late for the payment due October 15, 2011 and requested an accommodation from LPR, eventually paying an extra $5,000 towards that payment. At December 31, 2011, Nutra Pharma Corp. had made total payments of $205,000 with an additional $150,000 owed. In order to allow us to skip the December payment, LPR agreed to another accommodation whereby we would pay both the December and January payment with an additional $10,000 on or before January 16, 2012. We were unable to make this payment and on January 26, 2012 signed an amended payment schedule adding an additional $15,000 for a total of $175,000 owed. Our CEO, Rik Deitsch, added additional collateral stock in a separate company that he held personally. $25,000 was paid in January, with subsequent payments of $30,000 due monthly on the 15th of March through the 15th of July, 2012. We failed to make the March payment and was subsequently called in default of the Agreement. Under the original agreement, if we are in default of the agreement, LPR has the right to sell shares of our free trading stock held in escrow by their attorney and receive cash settlements for a total amount of $450,000 representing the new total cash amount due to LPR by the Company. 
   
 On June 11, 2012, LPR sold their debt to Southridge Partners, LLP in an agreement to be paid out over time. In August, 2013, LPR cancelled their agreement with Southridge Partners, LLP.  As of September 30, 2016, LPR continues to hold the collateral stock. We are currently negotiating a settlement with LPR. Upon the settlement of the outstanding debt, LPR will return the collateral shares to the Company. 
   
  Involuntary Petition of Bankruptcy  
   
  On August 31, 2012, certain former ReceptoPharm employees and a former ReceptoPharm consultant filed a Petition for Involuntary Bankruptcy against us in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida. The Petitioners originally claimed they were owed $990,927 from Nutra Pharma in the form of accrued wages and promissory notes, but amended their claim to $816,662 in a subsequent filing. In response to the Petition, we filed a motion to dismiss the action. On September 30, 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the Petitioners and the bankruptcy action was dismissed. In full and final satisfaction of all claims, the settlement agreement provides for payment to the Petitioners of a total sum of $350,000. As of September 30, 2016, $35,000 has been paid. As set forth below, the Petitioners have now filed a complaint in the 17   th    Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida to recover amounts allegedly owing to them under the settlement agreement.  
   
   Paul Reid et al. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. et al.   
   
  On August 26, 2016, certain of former ReceptoPharm employees and a former ReceptoPharm consultant filed a lawsuit in the 17   th    Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida against Nutra Pharma and Receptopharm to recover amounts allegedly owing to them under the settlement agreement reached in the involuntary bankruptcy action referenced above.  On September 28, 2016, Nutra Pharma and Receptopharm filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.  That motion is currently pending.   
   
  Nutra Pharma and Receptopharm believe that the lawsuit is without merit and also intend to file a counterclaim against these former employees/consultants for misconduct that Nutra Pharma discovered after execution of the aforementioned settlement agreement.  We intend to vigorously contest this matter.  
   
 During December 2015, the Petitioner's claims and accruals for a total of $1,085,468 that have passed the statute of limitation were written off, included in the amount was the accrued salary of $815,747, officer s loan and accrued interest for $129,466, salary and payroll tax payable of $140,255. Since the Petitioners can only reinforce the settlement amount due to passing of statute of limitation, the Company has accrued the settlement for $315,000 and recorded the gain on settlement of $770,968 in other income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accrued balance for the settlement has not changed as of September 30, 2016.

Nyloxin    (Stage 2 Pain) 
   
 Nyloxin    Extra Strength (Stage 3 Pain) 
   
 Pet Pain-Away  
   
 We will continue this focus during the remainder of 2016. 
   
 During our third quarter of 2016 and thereafter, the following has occurred: 
   
 On July 27, 2016, we announced the addition of Dan Oran to our Board of Directors. 
   
 Dan Oran is 50 years of age. He has more than 27 years of experience as a successful business owner in the US and Israel with extensive knowledge of finances, sales and cost management skills. Mr. Oran is also a seasoned Real Estate investor who owns and manages both commercial and residential properties in South Florida and abroad. Since 2014 he has been the brand builder and consultant for the  Cybertec Group , a communications technology company. From 2008 through 2014 he owned and managed  Aboulafia Since 1879 , a manufacturer and distributor of electronics equipment. From 1999 through 2008, Mr. Oran owned and managed  Lav Distributors , a distributor of electronics equipment. Mr. Oran was raised and educated in Israel, moving to the United States in 1990. 
   
 On July 27, 2016, we announced the addition of Dale Vanderputten, PhD as our Chief Scientific Officer (CSO). 
   
 Dale Vanderputten, PhD is 57 years of age. He has been CEO and CSO of the biotechnology company  Omnia Biologics, Inc. , headquartered in Rockville, MD since 2003.  From 1999 through 2003 he was COO and CSO of cancer gene therapy company  DirectGene, Inc. , headquartered in Annapolis, MD. Dr VanderPutten has held scientific and technology development positions in government, academia and industry from 1980 through 1999 including at the National Institutes of Health, University of Maryland, and  Proteome Sciences, plc.  Dr. VanderPutten received a Bachelor of Sciences degree in Biology and Chemistry from the American University in Washington, DC in 1982, a PhD in Genetics from the George Washington University in 1993 and an MBA from the University of Maryland in 1996. He did his doctoral and post-doctoral training in molecular neuro-biology at the National Institutes of Health. 
   
 On August 30, 2016 we announced the appointment of Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dowd, US Army (Ret.) as Strategic Advisor for the Company's newly created 'Military   Veterans' business segment. General Dowd will support Nutra Pharma's efforts in presenting the Company's non-opiate, non-narcotic over-the-counter (OTC) pain solution, Nyloxin  to the US Military and the Veteran's Administration. 
   
 On September 14, 2016 we announced a manufacturing alliance with Omnia Biologics to clone and produce alpha-cobratoxin for the production of RPI-78M for upcoming clinical trials in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis. 

Nyloxin     /Nyloxin      Extra Strength  
   
 We offer Nyloxin   /Nyloxin    Extra Strength as our over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever that has been clinically proven to treat moderate to severe (Stage 2) chronic pain.  
   
 Nyloxin    and Nyloxin    Extra Strength are available as a two ounce topical gel for treating joint pain and pain associated with arthritis and repetitive stress, and as a one ounce oral spray for treating lower back pain, migraines, neck aches, shoulder pain, cramps, and neuropathic pain. Both the topical gel and oral spray are packaged and sold as a one-month supply. 

30 

Nyloxin    and Nyloxin    Extra Strength offer several benefits as a pain reliever. With increasing concern about consumers using opioid and acetaminophen-based pain relievers, the Nyloxin    products provide an alternative that does not rely on opiates or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, otherwise known as NSAIDs, for their pain relieving effects. Nyloxin    also has a well-defined safety profile. Since the early 1930s, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Nyloxin   , Asian cobra venom, has been studied in more than 46 human clinical studies. The data from these studies provide clinical evidence that cobra venom provides an effective treatment for pain with few side effects and has the following benefits: 
   
    safe and effective;  
    all natural;  
    long-acting;  
    easy to use;  
    non-narcotic;  
    non-addictive; and  
    analgesic and anti-inflammatory.  
   
 Potential side effects from the use of Nyloxin    are rare, but may include headache, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, allergic rhinitis and coughing. 
   
 The primary difference between Nyloxin    and Nyloxin    Extra Strength is the dilution level of the venom. The approximate dilution levels for Nyloxin    and Nyloxin    Extra Strength are as follows: 
   
  Nyloxin     
   
    Topical Gel: 30 mcg/mL  
    Oral Spray: 70 mcg/mL  
   
  Nyloxin      Extra Strength  
   
    Topical Gel: 60 mcg/mL  
    Oral Spray: 140 mcg/mL  
   
 In December 2009, we began marketing Nyloxin    and Nyloxin    Extra Strength at www.nyloxin.com. Both Nyloxin    and Nyloxin    Extra Strength are packaged in a roll-on container, squeeze bottle and as an oral spray. Additionally, Nyloxin    topical gel is available in an 8 ounce pump bottle. 
   
 In December of 2013, we announced an agreement with MyNyloxin.com for the exclusive rights to market and distribute Nyloxin    in the Network Marketing channel. MyNyloxin.com provides a business opportunity to their Distributors to earn commissions on the sale of our products through their Distributor groups. In January of 2014, we announced the first product shipments to the MyNyloxin Independent Entrepreneurs (MIEs). MyNyloxin conducts webinars, conference calls and live meetings to support recruitment of new MIEs as well as to provide product and business education. In April of 2014, we announced that MyNyloxin.com had signed an agreement that creates the MyNyloxin Telemarketing Division (MTD). MTD began their telemarketing campaign on April 7 to identify customers for Nyloxin    as well as potential Distributors for MyNyloxin.com. In June of 2014, we announced that MyNyloxin had begun rolling out a national television campaign to support Nyloxin    branding and sales. In November of 2014, MyNyloxin.com changed their name to Lumaxa. 
   
 We are currently marketing Nyloxin    and Nyloxin    Extra Strength as treatments for moderate to severe chronic pain. Nyloxin    is available as an oral spray for treating back pain, neck pain, headaches, joint pain, migraines, and neuralgia and as a topical gel for treating joint pain, neck pain, arthritis pain, and pain associated with repetitive stress. Nyloxin    Extra Strength is available as an oral spray and gel application for treating the same physical indications, but is aimed at treating the most severe (Stage 3) pain that inhibits one s ability to function fully. 
   
  Nyloxin      Military Strength  
   
 In December 2012, we announced the availability of Nyloxin    Military Strength for sale to the United States Military and Veteran's Administration. Over the past few years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been reporting an increase in the use and abuse of prescription medications, particularly opiates. In 2009, close to 3.8 million prescriptions for pain relievers were written in the military. This staggering number was more than a 400% increase from the number of prescriptions written in the military in 2001. But prescription drugs are not the only issue. The most common and seemingly harmless way to treat pain is with non steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). But there are risks. Overuse can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, ulcers and internal  

31 

bleeding. In severe cases chest pain, heart failure, kidney dysfunction and life-threatening allergic reactions can occur. It is reported that approximately 7,600 people in America die from NSAID use and some 78,000 are hospitalized. Ibuprofen, also an NSAID has been of particular concern in the military. The terms  Ranger Candy  and  Military Candy  refer to the service men and women who are said to use 800mg doses of Ibuprofen to control their pain. But when taking anti-inflammatory Ibuprofen in high doses for chronic pain, there is potential for critical health risks; abuse can lead to serious stomach problems, internal bleeding and even kidney failure. There are significantly greater health risks when abuse of this drug is combined with alcohol intake. Our goal is that with Nyloxin   , we can greatly reduce the instances of opiate abuse and overuse of NSAIDS in high risk groups like the US military. The Nyloxin    Military Strength represents the strongest version of Nyloxin    available and is approximately twice as strong as Nyloxin    Extra Strength. We are working with outside consultants to register Nyloxin    Military Strength and the other Nyloxin    products for sale to the US government and the various arms of the military as well as the Veteran's Administration. To date, we have been unable to get our products onto the Federal Supply Schedule for eventual sales to governmental agencies or to the US Military, but will continue these efforts. In February of 2016, we announced the addition of Thomas W. Northrop as the Company's  Senior Commercial Development Officer . Mr. Northrop, working with Tri-State Capital Partners, LLC, a New York-based management advisory   investment firm, will be spearheading our efforts to gain approval with the US government buying agencies and the Veterans Administration. On August 30, 2016 we announced the appointment of Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dowd, US Army (Ret.) as  Strategic Advisor  for the Company's newly created 'Military   Veterans' business segment. General Dowd will support Nutra Pharma's efforts in presenting Nyloxin    to the US Military and the Veteran's Administration. 
   
  International Sales  
   
 We are pursuing international drug registrations in Canada, Mexico, India, Central and South America and Europe. Since European rules for homeopathic drugs are different than the rules in the US, we cannot estimate when this process will be completed. On March 25, 2013 we announced the publication of our patent and trademark for Nyloxin    in India.  We are currently working with potential Distributors in India. In February, 2015 we completed the first test shipments to India. We plan to begin active sales and marketing in India in early 2017. 
   
 On April 30, 2015 we announced that we had received notification of the acceptance of Nyloxin    by the China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Healthcare (CPAM). This process was successfully conducted by the Vancouver Commodities Group (VCG) that had been hired by Nutra Pharma to begin the process of identifying and vetting potential distributors in China. With this approval, we have been working with several groups to find a large distributor for our products in the People's Republic of China. We expect to announce a distribution partner in early 2017. 
   
 On May 14, 2015 we announced that we had engaged the Nature's Clinic to begin the process of regulatory approval of our Company's Over-the-Counter pain drug, Nyloxin    for marketing and distribution in Canada. The Nature s Clinic has already begun setting up their Chatham, Ontario warehouse and expect to complete the approval process to begin distributing Nyloxin    by mid-2017. 
   
 Additionally, we plan to complete several human clinical studies aimed at comparing the ability of Nyloxin    Extra Strength to replace prescription pain relievers. We have provided protocols to several hospitals and will provide details and timelines when those protocols have been accepted. We cannot provide any timeline for these studies until adequate financing is available. 
   
 To date, our marketing efforts have been limited due to lack of funding. As sales increase, we plan to begin marketing more aggressively to increase the sales and awareness of our products. 
   
  Pet Pain-Away   
   
 During June of 2013, we announced the launch of our new homeopathic formula for the treatment of chronic pain in companion animals, Pet Pain-Away . Pet Pain-Away  is a homeopathic, non-narcotic, non-addictive, over-the-counter pain reliever, primarily aimed at treating moderate to severe chronic pain in companion animals. It is specifically indicated to treat pain from hip dysplasia, arthritis pain, joint pain, and general chronic pain in dogs and cats. The initial product run was completed in December of 2014 and launched through Lumaxa Distributors on December 19, 2014. 
   
 In May of 2016, we signed a license agreement to begin the process of creating an infomercial (Direct Response) campaign for Pet Pain-Away . We expect the commercials to start airing by the end of 2016. 
   
  Drug Discovery and Pipeline  
   
 Nutra Pharma is developing proprietary therapeutic protein products for the biologics market. The Company has two leading drug candidates: RPI-MN and RPI-78M. 

32 

RPI-MN  
   
 RPI-MN inhibits the entry of several viruses that are known to cause severe neurological damage in such diseases as encephalitis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is being developed first for the treatment of HIV. 
   
  RPI-78M  
   
 RPI-78M is being developed for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). Other neurological and autoimmune disorders that may be served by RPI-78M include Myasthenia Gravis (MG), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). 
   
 RPI-78M and RPI-MN contain anticholinergic peptides that recognize the same receptors as nicotine (acetylcholine receptors) but have the opposite effect. In a specific chemical process unique to Nutra Pharma, the drugs are created through a process of chemical modification. 
   
 In September, 2015 RPI-78M was granted Orphan Status by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric Multiple Sclerosis. This allows for much shorter timelines to drug approval, waiver of FDA fees (around $2.5M), rolling review and fast-track approval. Orphan status also allows for potential grant money and other funding opportunities through the clinical process. 
   
  RPI-MN and RPI-78M possess several desirable properties as drugs:  

They lack measurable toxicity but are still capable of attaching to and affecting the target site on the nerve cells. This means that patients cannot overdose. 
   
 They display no serious adverse side effects following years of investigations in humans and animals. 
   
 They are extremely stable and resistant to heat, which gives the drugs a long shelf life. The drugs' stability has been determined to be over 4 years at room temperature. This is extremely unusual for a biologic drug. 
   
 RPI-78M may be administered orally -- a first for a biologic MS drug. This will present MS patients with additional quality of life benefits by eliminating the requirement for routine injections. 
   
 They are easy to administer. 
   
 We are currently working with consultants to develop trial protocols for a Phase I/II trial for the use of RPI-78M in the treatment of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis. We expect to begin the trial in the first half of 2017. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 Our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) applied on a consistent basis.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
   
 We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements.  In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party professionals, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management under different and/or future circumstances. 
   
 We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include our ability to continue as a going concern, revenue recognition, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, accounting for long-lived assets and accounting for stock based compensation. 
   
  Ability to Continue as a Going Concern:   Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our ability to secure additional financing, increase ownership equity, and attain profitable operations.  In addition, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered in established markets and the competitive environment in which we operate. 
   
  Revenue Recognition:  In general, we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Provision for sales returns will be estimated based on the Company's historical return experience. 

33 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  Our accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed to arrive at appropriate allowances. 
   
  Inventory Obsolescence:  Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market value. We periodically perform an evaluation of inventory for excess, impairments and obsolete items. 
   
  Long-Lived Assets:  The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed annually and on a regular basis for the existence of facts and circumstances that may suggest impairment. If indicators of impairment are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the long-lived asset in question is less than its carrying amount. If less, we measure the amount of the impairment based on the amount that the carrying value of the impaired asset exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the impaired assets. 
   
  Derivative Financial Instrument:  We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. Management evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based simple derivative financial instruments, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. For complex embedded derivatives, we use a Dilution-Adjusted Black-Scholes method to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
   
  Share-Based Compensation:  We record share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation. FASB ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions are recorded in the financial statements over the respective service periods. It establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. FASB ASC 718 also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment transactions. 
   
  Results of Operations   Comparison of Three Months Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
   
 Net sales for the three-month period ended September   30, 2016 are $70,487 compared to $52,869 for the three months period ended September   30, 2015.  The increase in net sales is primarily attributable to the increase in Nyloxin    sales. 
   
 Cost of sales for the three-month period ended September   30, 2016 is $9,925 compared to $12,524 for the three-month period ended September   30, 2015.  Our cost of sales includes the direct costs associated with Nyloxin    manufacturing. Our gross profit margin for the three-month period ended September   30, 2016 is $60,562 or 85.9% compared to $40,345 or 76.3% for the three-month period ended September   30, 2015. The increase in our profit margin is due primarily to the decrease in the credit card processing fees. 
   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) decreased $3,390,436 or 85.7% from $3,957,014 for the quarter ended September   30, 2015 to $566,578 for the quarter ended September   30, 2016, generally due to the decrease of stock based compensation of approximately $2,200,000, the decrease of approximately $1,260,000 in selling expense related to distributors and loss on settlement of accounts payable, offset by the increase of approximately $23,000 in payroll, and $46,000 in consulting, investor relations, travel and professional fees.   
   
 Rental income decreased $10,355 or 100%, from $10,355 for the quarter ended September   30, 2015 to $nil for the comparable 2016 period.  This decrease was due to a sublease agreement terminated in April 2016. 
   
 Interest expense decreased $79,316 or 57.2%, from $138,769 for the quarter ended September   30, 2015 to $59,453 for the comparable 2016 period.  This decrease was due to decrease in amortization of loan discounts in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 We carry certain of our debentures and common stock warrants at fair value. For the three months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, the liability related to these hybrid instruments fluctuated, resulting in a loss of $160,563 and gain of $90,102, respectively.   

34 

Gain on settlement of debt and accounts payable increased $65,432 or 394.6%, from the gain of $16,583 for the three months ended September   30, 2015 to the gain of $82,015 for the comparable 2016 period.  This increase was due to an increase in settlement of debts and accounts payable through issuance of stocks for the three months ended September   30, 2016 compared to the comparable 2015 period. 
   
 As a result of the foregoing, our net loss decreased by $3,294,381 or 83.7%, from $3,938,398 for the quarter ended September   30, 2015 to $644,017 for the comparable 2016 period. 
   
  Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
   
 Net sales for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 are $138,556 compared to $251,930 for the nine months ended September   30, 2015.  The decrease in sales is primarily attributable to an overall decrease in sales of Nyloxin   . 
   
 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 is $28,120 compared to $57,199 for the nine months ended September   30, 2015.  Our cost of sales includes the direct costs associated with Nyloxin    manufacturing. Our gross profit margin for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 is $110,436 or 79.7% compared to $194,731 or 77.3% for the nine months ended September   30, 2015. The decrease in our profit margin is due primarily to increase in the credit card processing fees. 
   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) decreased  $3,820,445 or 70.8% from $5,400,295 for the nine months ended September   30, 2015 to $1,579,850 for the nine months ended September   30, 2016, generally due to the decrease of approximately $540,000 in legal fees and potential penalty on default payment of settlement of Meding case, decrease in stock based compensation of $2,180,000, the decrease of approximately $1,260,000 in selling expense related to distributors and loss on settlement of accounts payable, offset by the increase of $160,000 in consulting, payroll, travel and professional fees.  
   
 Rental income increased $2,662 or 15.9%, from $16,719 for the nine months ended September   30, 2015 to $19,381 for the comparable 2016 period.  This increase was due to a sublease agreement entered in April, 2015 and ended in April, 2016. 
   
 Interest expense decreased $101,717 or 33.7%, from $302,149 for the nine months ended September   30, 2015 to $200,432 for the comparable 2016 period.  This decrease was due to decrease in amortization of loan discounts in the nine months ended September   30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September   30, 2015. 
   
 We carry certain of our debentures and common stock warrants at fair value. For the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, the liability related to these hybrid instruments fluctuated, resulting in a loss of $972,750 and $593,671, respectively. 
   
 Gain on settlement of debt and accounts payable increased $233,863 or 1410.3%, from the gain of $16,583 for the nine months ended September   30, 2015 to the gain of $250,446 for the comparable 2016 period.  This increase was due to an increase in settlement of debts and accounts payable through issuance of stocks for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 compared to the comparable 2015 period. 
   
 Our net loss decreased by $3,695,313 or 60.9%, from $6,068,082 for the nine months ended September   30, 2015 to $2,372,769 for the comparable 2016 period. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 We have incurred significant losses from operations and working capital and stockholders  deficits raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Further, as stated in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements for the period ended September   30, 2016, we have an accumulated deficit  of  $52,284,555  and working capital and stockholders  deficits of  $3,966,190  and  $4,104,186 , respectively.  
   
 Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our ability to secure additional financing, increase ownership equity, and attain profitable operations.  In addition, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered in established markets and the competitive environment in which we operate. As of September   30, 2016, we do not believe that our source of cash is adequate for the next 12 months of operation and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 Historically, we have relied upon loans from our Chief Executive Officer, Rik Deitsch, to fund our operations. These loans are unsecured, accrue interest at a rate of 4.0% per annum and are due on demand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we borrowed $149,951 and repaid $162,675 to Mr. Deitsch and the Companies owned by him. In addition, Mr. Deitsch accepted a total of 15,000,000 shares of the Company s restricted common stock as a repayment to discharge $100,000 of his outstanding loan in June 2016.  The amount owed to Mr. Deitsch and its Companies at  September   30, 2016  was  $41,328. 

35 

Subsequent to  September 30, 2016  and through  November 21, 2016 , the Company borrowed  $130,000  and repaid  $26,500  to its President, Rik  Deitsch and the Companies owned by him.  The amount owed to Mr. Deitsch and its Companies at  November 21, 2016  was  $146,089. 
   
 As of September   30, 2016, we raised $200,000 through issuance of promissory notes from the Companies owned by one of our directors, $704,625, net of debt discount and loan issuance cost of a total of $15,375 through issuance of promissory notes, $494,000, net of debt discount and loan issuance cost of $18,870, through the issuance of convertible notes. 
   
 We expect to utilize the proceeds from these funds and additional capital to manufacture Nyloxin    and Pet Pain-Away and reduce our debt level.  We estimate that we will require approximately $100,000 to fund our existing operations and ReceptoPharm s operations through December 31, 2016.  These costs include: (i) compensation for three (3) full-time employees; (ii) compensation for various consultants who we deem critical to our business; (iii) general office expenses including rent and utilities; (iv) product liability insurance; and (v) outside legal and accounting services.  These costs reflected in (i)   (v) do not include research and development costs or other costs associated with clinical studies. 
   
 We began generating revenues from the sale of Cobroxin    in the fourth quarter of 2009 and from the sale of Nyloxin    during the first quarter of 2011.  Our ability to meet our future operating expenses is highly dependent on the amount of such future revenues.  To the extent that future revenues from the sales of Cobroxin    and Nyloxin    are insufficient to cover our operating expenses we may need to raise additional equity capital, which could result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient equity capital to fund our working capital requirements on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  We may also seek additional loans from our officers and directors; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing such additional loans. 
   
  Uncertainties and Trends  
   
 Our operations and possible revenues are dependent now and in the future upon the following factors: 

whether Nyloxin   , Nyloxin    Extra Strength and Pet Pain-Away  will be accepted by retail establishments where they are sold;

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 As of September   30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September   30, 2016, as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ).  Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed in Section 9A of our annual report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at a reasonable assurance level, as of September   30, 2016. In light of this, we performed additional post-closing procedures and analyses in order to prepare the Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements included in this report. As a result of these procedures, we believe our Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  A control system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with the company have been detected. 
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who also acted as our Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September   30, 2016 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
   
  Patricia Meding, et. al. v. ReceptoPharm, Inc. f/k/a Receptogen, Inc.  
   
 On June 1, 2015, ReceptoPharm entered into a settlement agreement with Patricia Meding, a former officer and shareholder of ReceptoPharm.  The settlement relates to a lawsuit filed by Ms. Meding against ReceptoPharm (Patricia Meding, et. al. v. ReceptoPharm, Inc. f/k/a Receptogen, Inc., Index No.: 18247/06, New York Supreme Court, Queens County) in which she claimed to own certain shares of ReceptoPharm stock and claimed to be owed amounts on a series of promissory notes allegedly executed in 2001 and 2002.  
   
 The settlement agreement executed on June 1, 2015 provides that ReceptoPharm will pay Ms. Meding a total of $360,000 over 35 months. The first payment of $20,000 was made on July 1, 2015. A second payment of $20,000 was made on August 17, 2015 with 32 subsequent monthly $10,000 payments due on the 15th of every month thereafter. To date, ReceptoPharm has made all monthly payments due under the agreement.  In the event of default on any of the payments due under the settlement agreement, the settlement amount would increase by an additional $200,000.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued the legal settlement amount at present value of $172,260 and an additional contingency of $200,000. The settlement agreement is personally guaranteed by Rik Deitsch, our CEO. 
   
  Liquid Packaging Resources, Inc. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. and Erik  Rik  Deitsch   
   
 On April 21, 2011, Nutra Pharma Corp. and its CEO, Erik Deitsch, were named as defendants in  Liquid Packaging Resources, Inc. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. and Erik  Rik  Deitsch , Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, Civil Action No. 2011-CV-199562. Liquid Packaging Resources, Inc. ( LPR ) claimed that Nutra Pharma Corp. and Mr. Deitsch, directly or through other companies, placed orders with LPR that required LPR to purchase components from third parties. LPR sought reimbursement for those third party expenses in the amount of not less than $359,826.85 plus interest. LPR also sought punitive damages in the amount of not less than $500,000 and attorney's fees. 
   
 Mr. Deitsch and Nutra Pharma Corp. then removed the action to the United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Civil Action No. 11-CV-01663-ODE. After removal, LPR amended the Complaint to assert that Nutra Pharma Corp. and Mr. Deitsch were the alter egos of the alleged other companies through whom the subject orders were placed and therefore should be considered one and the same. Mr. Deitsch and Nutra Pharma Corp.  moved to dismiss the Complaint on several grounds including statute of frauds, failure to state a claim, and jurisdiction (only for Mr. Deitsch). Mr. Deitsch and Nutra Pharma Corp. believe the suit is without merit. 
   
 After September 30, 2011, at LPR's request, the parties mediated the dispute before LPR responded to the Motion To Dismiss. At the mediation, the parties worked out an agreement whereby Nutra Pharma Corp. would purchase from LPR the components LPR purchased from third parties at an amount slightly less than the principal amount of the suit and on terms acceptable to us. The agreed price was $350,000 payable over 7 months in equal $50,000 amounts. This agreement was reached by us because it provided tangible value in exchange for the purchase price rather than incurring the expense of litigation, which would likely be substantial and not recouped. While Nutra Pharma Corp.  had counterclaims we could assert, we believe this was a practical resolution. The settlement allowed us to take possession of the components prior to full payment and, in exchange, provided security to LPR in the form of our stock valued at $400,000 at the time of issuance. The stock can only be sold in event of a default of the payment schedule. The litigation was dismissed in August of 2011. We made the August, September and November payments (totaling $150,000) in a timely fashion. We were late for the payment due October 15, 2011 and requested an accommodation from LPR, eventually paying an extra $5,000 towards that payment. At December 31, 2011, Nutra Pharma Corp. had made total payments of $205,000 with an additional $150,000 owed. In order to allow us to skip the December payment, LPR agreed to another accommodation whereby we would pay both the December and January payment with an additional $10,000 on or before January 16, 2012. We were unable to make this payment and on January 26, 2012 signed an amended payment schedule adding an additional $15,000 for a total of $175,000 owed. Our CEO, Rik Deitsch, added additional collateral stock in a separate company that he held personally. $25,000 was paid in January, with subsequent payments of $30,000 due monthly on the 15th of March through the 15th of July, 2012. We failed to make the March payment and was subsequently called in default of the Agreement. Under the original agreement, if we are in default of the agreement, LPR has the right to sell shares of our free trading stock held in escrow by their attorney and receive cash settlements for a total amount of $450,000 representing the new total cash amount due to LPR by the Company. 
   
 On June 11, 2012, LPR sold their debt to Southridge Partners, LLP in an agreement to be paid out over time. In August, 2013, LPR cancelled their agreement with Southridge Partners, LLP.  As of September 30, 2016, LPR continues to hold the collateral stock. We are currently negotiating a settlement with LPR. Upon the settlement of the outstanding debt, LPR will return the collateral shares to the Company.

Involuntary Petition of Bankruptcy  
   
  On August 31, 2012, certain former ReceptoPharm employees and a former ReceptoPharm consultant filed a Petition for Involuntary Bankruptcy against us in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida. The Petitioners originally claimed they were owed $990,927 from Nutra Pharma in the form of accrued wages and promissory notes, but amended their claim to $816,662 in a subsequent filing. In response to the Petition, we filed a motion to dismiss the action. On September 30, 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the Petitioners and the bankruptcy action was dismissed. In full and final satisfaction of all claims, the settlement agreement provides for payment to the Petitioners of a total sum of $350,000. As of September 30, 2016, $35,000 has been paid. As set forth below, the Petitioners have now filed a complaint in the 17   th    Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida to recover amounts allegedly owing to them under the settlement agreement.  
     
   Paul Reid et al. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. et al.   
   
  On August 26, 2016, certain of former ReceptoPharm employees and a former ReceptoPharm consultant filed a lawsuit in the 17   th    Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida against Nutra Pharma and Receptopharm to recover amounts allegedly owing to them under the settlement agreement reached in the involuntary bankruptcy action referenced above.  On September 28, 2016, Nutra Pharma and Receptopharm filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.  That motion is currently pending.   
   
  Nutra Pharma and Receptopharm believe that the lawsuit is without merit and also intend to file a counterclaim against these former employees/consultants for misconduct that Nutra Pharma discovered after execution of the aforementioned settlement agreement.  We intend to vigorously contest this matter.  
   
 During December 2015, the Petitioner's claims and accruals for a total of $1,085,468 that have passed the statute of limitation were written off, included in the amount was the accrued salary of $815,747, officer s loan and accrued interest for $129,466, salary and payroll tax payable of $140,255. Since the Petitioners can only reinforce the settlement amount due to passing of statute of limitation, the Company has accrued the settlement for $315,000 and recorded the gain on settlement of $770,968 in other income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accrued balance for the settlement has not changed as of September 30, 2016.
