ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO INTERIM (UNAUDITED) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
     
  Nature of Operations  
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation ( RMCF ), and Aspen Leaf Yogurt, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( ALY ), U-Swirl International, Inc. ( U-Swirl ) (a Nevada corporation), and its 39%-owned subsidiary, U-Swirl, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( SWRL ) of which, RMCF had financial control until February 29, 2016 (collectively, the  Company ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
  The Company is an international franchisor, confectionery manufacturer and retail operator in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Founded in 1981, the Company is headquartered in Durango, Colorado and manufactures an extensive line of premium chocolate candies and other confectionery products. U-Swirl franchises and operates self-serve frozen yogurt stores. The Company also sells its candy in selected locations outside of its system of retail stores and licenses the use of its brand with certain consumer products.  
     
  Effective March 1, 2015, the Company was reorganized to create a holding company structure. The operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation, which was previously the public company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a newly formed entity, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Newco ), and all of the outstanding shares of common stock of RMCF, par value $0.03 per share, were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Newco. The new holding company began trading on March 2, 2015 on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol  RMCF , which was the same symbol used by RMCF prior to the holding company reorganization.     
     
  In January 2013, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including ALY, the Company entered into two agreements to sell all of the assets of its ALY frozen yogurt stores, along with its interest in the self-serve frozen yogurt franchises and retail units branded as  Yogurtini  which the Company also acquired in January 2013, to SWRL, in exchange for a 60% controlling equity interest in SWRL, which was subsequently diluted down to 39% as of August 31, 2016 following various issuances of common stock of SWRL. At that time, U-Swirl was a wholly-owned subsidiary of SWRL, and was the operating subsidiary for all of SWRL s operations. Upon completion of these transactions, we ceased to directly operate any Company-owned ALY locations or sell and support frozen yogurt franchise locations, which were being supported by SWRL. As of August 31, 2016, the Company held a 39% interest in SWRL. The SWRL Board of Directors is composed solely of Board members also serving the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. Board of Directors.  
     
  In fiscal year ( FY ) 2014, SWRL acquired the franchise rights and certain other assets of self-serve frozen yogurt concepts under the names  CherryBerry,   Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt  and  Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt.  In connection with these acquisitions, the Company entered into a credit facility with Wells Fargo, N.A. used to finance the acquisitions of SWRL, and in turn, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with SWRL to cover the purchase price and other costs associated with the acquisitions (the  SWRL Loan Agreement ). Borrowings under the SWRL Loan Agreement were secured by all of the assets of SWRL, including all of the outstanding stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, U-Swirl. Under the SWRL Loan Agreement, SWRL was subject to various financial covenants. SWRL was not compliant with the financial covenants during the year ended February 29, 2016 and the loan matured on January 16, 2016 without payment in full by SWRL. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Company was entitled to charge interest on all amounts due under the SWRL Loan Agreement at the default rate of 15% per annum, accelerate payment of all amounts due under the SWRL Loan Agreement, and foreclose on all or any portion of the security interest. As a result of the defaults, the Company issued a demand for payment of all obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement. SWRL was unable to repay the obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement, and as a result, the Company foreclosed on all of the outstanding stock of U-Swirl on February 29, 2016 in full satisfaction of the amounts owed under the SWRL Loan Agreement. This resulted in U-Swirl becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company as of February 29, 2016 and concurrently the Company ceased to have financial control of SWRL as of February 29, 2016. As of February 29, 2016, SWRL had no operating assets. During FY 2016, SWRL acquired the franchise rights of  Let s Yo! .  
     
  U-Swirl operates self-serve frozen yogurt caf s under the names  U-Swirl,   Yogurtini,   CherryBerry,   Josie s Frozen Yogurt,   Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt,   Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt,   Let s Yo!  and  Aspen Leaf Yogurt .

ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO INTERIM (UNAUDITED) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
      
  The Company s revenues are currently derived from three principal sources: sales to franchisees and others of chocolates and other confectionery products manufactured by the Company; the collection of initial franchise fees and royalties from franchisees  sales of both confectionary products and frozen yogurt; and sales at Company-owned stores of chocolates, frozen yogurt, and other confectionery products. The following table summarizes the number of stores operating under the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory brand and frozen yogurt caf s as of August 31, 2016:  

*U-Swirl caf s and the brands franchised by U-Swirl have historically utilized a development area sales model. The result is that many areas are under development, and the rights to open caf s within the development areas have been established, but there is no assurance that any individual development area will result in a determinable number of caf  openings.  
     
  Basis of Presentation  
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.   In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature) which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the six months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year.   
     
  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.   
     
  Subsequent Events  
     
  Management evaluated all activity of the Company through the issue date of the financial statements and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.  
     
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
     
  In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under ASC 840  Leases.  These amendments also require qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Entities are required to apply the amendments at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO INTERIM (UNAUDITED) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
      
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU No. 2016-15 clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP and thereby reduce the current diversity in practice. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning March 1, 2018. The Company does not anticipate that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. ASU 2016- 13 will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning March 1, 2020 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The ASU simplifies the accounting of stock compensation, including income tax implications, the balance sheet classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the cash flow classification of employee share based payment transactions. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. This guidance is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning March 1, 2017. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement must be applied prospectively. Amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively based on the Company s election. Amendments related to the statement of cash flows presentation of employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares must be applied retrospectively. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, supersedes current guidance on revenue recognition in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods. Early application of the guidance is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016. This guidance is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning March 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE 2   EARNINGS PER SHARE  
     
  Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common stock issuable through stock options and restricted stock units. For the three months ended August 31, 2016, there were no stock options excluded from the computation of earnings per share, compared with 12,936 stock options excluded from the computation of earnings per share for the three months ended August 31, 2015 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the six months ended August 31, 2016, there were no stock options excluded from the computation of earnings per share, compared with 12,936 stock options excluded from the computation of earnings per share for the six months ended August 31, 2015 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Restricted stock units become dilutive within the period granted and remain dilutive until the units vest and are issued as common stock.

NOTE 7   OPERATING SEGMENTS  
     
  The Company classifies its business interests into five reportable segments: Franchising, Manufacturing, Retail Stores, U-Swirl operations and Other. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements and Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on operating contribution, which excludes unallocated   corporate general and administrative costs and income tax expense or benefit. The Company s reportable segments are strategic businesses that utilize common merchandising, distribution and marketing functions, as well as common information systems and corporate administration. All inter-segment sales prices are market based. Each segment is managed separately because of the differences in required infrastructure and the difference in products and services:     

Revenue from one customer of the Company s Manufacturing segment represented approximately $1.5 million, or 8.6 percent, of the Company s revenues from external customers during the six months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $2.3 million, or 11.8 percent of the Company s revenues from external customers during the six months ended August 31, 2015.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   
   NOTES TO INTERIM (UNAUDITED) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
      
  In January 2014, SWRL entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  CherryBerry Purchase Agreement ) with CherryBerry Enterprises LLC, CherryBerry Corporate LLC, CherryBerry LLC (collectively, the  CherryBerry Entities ), and their respective owners (collectively, the  CherryBerry Selling Parties ), pursuant to which SWRL acquired the franchise rights of frozen yogurt stores branded as  CherryBerry  (the  CherryBerry Acquisition ). As a part of the consideration for the CherryBerry Acquisition, SWRL agreed to issue an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of SWRL common stock (the  CB Shares ) to the CherryBerry Selling Parties, which were subject to a one-year lock-up agreement. The CB Shares were issued to the CherryBerry Selling Parties in February 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement, following expiration of the lock-up period, if any of the CherryBerry Selling Parties desired to sell their CB Shares, they must first offer such shares to SWRL and RMCF prior to any sale of the CB Shares on the open market. If the proceeds from the sale of any of the CB Shares is less than $0.50 per share and the CherryBerry Selling Parties comply with other terms of the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement, SWRL agreed to pay a shortfall payment equal to the difference of the sale price of the CB Shares and $0.50 per share, multiplied by the number of shares sold by the CherryBerry Selling Parties. If SWRL had been required to pay the shortfall payment on February 29, 2016, the shortfall payment would have been approximately $1,800,000. SWRL determined the likelihood of incurring the liability to be less than probable and has not recorded a contingent liability at February 29, 2016. In July and August 2015, the CherryBerry Selling Parties submitted to SWRL several requests for payment of approximately $205,000 of shortfall payments based on the sale of a portion of the CB Shares.   
     
  In August 2015, SWRL filed a lawsuit against the CherryBerry Selling Parties, a former officer and director of SWRL and unknown other parties, in the District Court for La Plata County, Colorado, alleging wrongful actions on their part to cause the price of SWRL s common stock to decline and thereafter making an improper demand for the shortfall payment described above, and certain other actions in violation of various provisions of the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement. SWRL sought unspecified damages, attorney s fees, other costs, and a determination that the shortfall payment arrangement is void. In September 2015, the CherryBerry Selling Parties filed an answer and counterclaim to the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, and moved the lawsuit to federal court in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (the  Colorado District Court ). In addition, the CherryBerry Entities added RMCF to the lawsuit through a third-party complaint. The complaint alleged that SWRL materially breached the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement by not paying the shortfall payment, that SWRL is the alter ego of RMCF and RMCF is liable for any obligations of SWRL, and that the SWRL Loan Agreement should be recharacterized as equity. The CherryBerry Entities sought payment in full of the shortfall payment under the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement, declaratory judgements that SWRL is the alter ego of RMCF and the SWRL Loan Agreement should be recharacterized as equity, and interest, attorney s fees, costs and other equitable relief.   
     
  On January 13, 2016, the CherryBerry Entities dismissed without prejudice their counterclaim and third-party complaint in the Colorado District Court, and thereafter on January 13, 2016, the CherryBerry Entities refiled the exact claims (the  Oklahoma Action ) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma (the  Oklahoma Court ). Also on January 13, 2016, RMCF filed a lawsuit against the CherryBerry Entities in the Colorado District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that it is not the alter ego of SWRL and that the SWRL Loan Agreement should not be re-characterized as equity (the  Colorado Action ). On that same date, SWRL filed a complaint against the CherryBerry Selling Parties asserting the same claims as it had asserted previously. RMCF filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue and in the alternative a motion to transfer venue in response to the Oklahoma Action, and the CherryBerry Selling Parties subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the Colorado Action. In April 2016, the Colorado District Court granted in part the CherryBerry Selling Parties  motion and administratively closed the case. In addition, in April 2016, the Oklahoma Court denied RMCF s motion (and SWRL s similar motion). On April 8, 2016, the CherryBerry Entities moved to add RMCF as a defendant on the alter ego and re-characterization claims in the Oklahoma Action. On May 9, 2016, the Oklahoma Court granted that application. We intend to vigorously assert and defend our rights in this lawsuit.

   Unless otherwise specified, the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  refers to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.   
     
   Overview   
     
  Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (including its operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation) (collectively, the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) is an international franchisor, confectionery manufacturer and retail operator. Founded in 1981, we are headquartered in Durango, Colorado and manufacture an extensive line of premium chocolate candies and other confectionery products. Our subsidiary, U-Swirl International, Inc. ( U-Swirl ), franchises and operates self-serve frozen yogurt stores. Our revenues and profitability are derived principally from our franchised/license system of retail stores that feature chocolate, frozen yogurt and other confectionary products. We also sell our candy in selected locations outside of our system of retail stores and license the use of our brand with certain consumer products. As of August 31, 2016, there were 3 Company-owned, 81 licensee-owned and 284 franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores operating in 40 states, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As of August 31, 2016, U-Swirl operated 6 Company-owned stores and 196 franchised stores located in 38 states, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. U-Swirl operates self-serve frozen yogurt caf s under the names  U-Swirl,   Yogurtini,   CherryBerry,   Josie s Frozen Yogurt,   Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt,   Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt,   Let s Yo!  and  Aspen Leaf Yogurt .   
     
  Effective March 1, 2015, we reorganized to create a holding company structure. Our operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation ( RMCF ), which was previously the public company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a newly formed entity, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Newco ), and all of the outstanding shares of common stock of RMCF were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of common stock of Newco. Our new holding company began trading on March 2, 2015 on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol  RMCF , which was the same symbol used by RMCF prior to the holding company reorganization.  
     
  In January 2013, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Aspen Leaf Yogurt, LLC ( ALY ), we entered into two agreements to sell all of the assets of our ALY frozen yogurt stores, along with our interest in the self-serve frozen yogurt franchises and retail units branded as  Yogurtini  which we acquired in January 2013, to U-Swirl, Inc., a publicly traded company (OTCQB: SWRL) ( SWRL ), in exchange for a 60% controlling equity interest in SWRL, which was subsequently diluted down to 39% as of February 29, 2016 following various issuances of common stock of SWRL. At that time, U-Swirl was a wholly-owned subsidiary of SWRL, and was the operating subsidiary for all of SWRL s operations. Upon completion of these transactions, we ceased to directly operate any Company-owned ALY locations or sell and support frozen yogurt franchise locations, which was being supported by SWRL.   

15

In fiscal year ( FY ) 2014, SWRL acquired the franchise rights and certain other assets of self-serve frozen yogurt concepts under the names  CherryBerry,   Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt  and  Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt.  In connection with these acquisitions, the Company entered into a credit facility with Wells Fargo, N.A. used to finance the acquisitions of SWRL, and in turn, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with SWRL to cover the purchase price and other costs associated with the acquisitions (the  SWRL Loan Agreement ). Borrowings under the SWRL Loan Agreement were secured by all of the assets of SWRL, including all of the outstanding stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, U-Swirl. Under the SWRL Loan Agreement, SWRL was subject to various financial covenants. SWRL was not compliant with the financial covenants during the year ended February 29, 2016 and the loan matured on January 16, 2016 without payment in full by SWRL. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, we were entitled to charge interest on all amounts due under the SWRL Loan Agreement at the default rate of 15% per annum, accelerate payment of all amounts due under the SWRL Loan Agreement, and foreclose on all or any portion of the security interest. As a result of the defaults, we issued a demand for payment of all obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement. SWRL was unable to repay the obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement, and as a result, we foreclosed on all of the outstanding stock of U-Swirl on February 29, 2016 in full satisfaction of the amounts owed under the SWRL Loan Agreement. This resulted in U-Swirl becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company as of February 29, 2016 and concurrently the Company ceased to have financial control of SWRL as of February 29, 2016. As of February 29, 2016, SWRL had no operating assets. During FY 2016, SWRL acquired the franchise rights of  Let s Yo! .  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
   Three Months Ended August 31, 201  6   Compared to the Three Months Ended August 31, 201  5      
     
  Basic earnings per share increased 30.8% from $0.13 in the three months ended August 31, 2015 to $0.17 in the three months ended August 31, 2016. Revenues decreased 7.3% from $9.3 million in the three months ended August 31, 2015 to $8.6 million in the three months ended August 31, 2016. Operating income decreased 8.4% from $1.70 million in the three months ended August 31, 2015 to $1.55 million in the three months ended August 31, 2016. Net income increased 25.0% from $780,000 in the three months ended August 31, 2015 to $975,000 in the three months ended August 31, 2016.   The decrease in operating income was due primarily to lower revenue in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015. This decrease was more than offset by no amount of net income being attributable to non-controlling interest.   

Factory Sales  
     
  The decrease in factory sales for the three months ended August 31, 2016 versus the three months ended August 31, 2015 was primarily due to a 44.5% decrease in shipments of product to customers outside our network of franchise retail locations partially offset by a 4.2% increase in purchases by our network of franchised and licensed stores. Revenue from one customer of the Company s Manufacturing segment represented approximately $132,000, or 2.7% of factory sales, during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to revenue of $308,000, or 6.0% of factory sales, from the same customer in the three months ended August 31, 2015. Same store pounds purchased by domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchise and license locations decreased 2.1% in the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared with the three months ended August 31, 2015.  
     
  Retail Sales   
     
  The decrease in retail sales was primarily due to changes in retail units in operation resulting from the sale of certain Company-owned locations and the closure of a certain underperforming Company-owned location. Same store sales at all Company-owned stores and caf s increased 0.2% in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015.  
     
  Royalties, Marketing Fees and Franchise Fees  
     
  The decrease in royalties and marketing fees from the three months ended August 31, 2015 to the three months ended August 31, 2016 resulted from a 12.9% decrease in domestic franchise units in operation and lower same store sales. The average number of total domestic franchise stores in operation decreased from 442 in the three months ended August 31, 2015 to 385 during the three months ended August 31, 2016.   This decrease is the result of domestic store closures exceeding domestic store openings. Same store sales at total franchise stores and caf s in operation decreased 0.1% during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015. Franchise fee revenues decreased primarily as a result of fewer U-Swirl caf s being opened and a decline in international license fees recognized during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015.

Adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted gross margin is equal to the sum of our factory adjusted gross margin plus our retail gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP. Factory adjusted gross margin is equal to factory gross margin minus depreciation and amortization expense. We believe adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin are helpful in understanding our past performance as a supplement to gross margin, factory gross margin and other performance measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin are useful to investors because they provide a measure of operating performance and our ability to generate cash that is unaffected by non-cash accounting measures. Additionally, we use adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin rather than gross margin and factory gross margin to make incremental pricing decisions. Adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin have limitations as analytical tools because they exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization expense and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for any measure reported under GAAP. Our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate income. Due to these limitations, we use adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin as measures of performance only in conjunction with GAAP measures of performance such as gross margin and factory gross margin. The following table provides a reconciliation of factory adjusted gross margin to factory gross margin, the most comparable performance measure under GAAP:  

Cost of Sales  
     
  Factory margins decreased 50 basis points in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015 due primarily to lower costs of certain materials more than offset by increased costs of labor and overhead in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease in Company-owned store margin is due primarily to a decrease in Company-owned caf  revenue resulting from the sale of yogurt and the associated higher margins. This change is the result of a   change in units in operation during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.   

17

Franchise Costs  
     
  The decrease in franchise costs in the three months ended August 31, 2016 versus the three months ended August 31, 2015 is due primarily to lower franchise costs associated with supporting U-Swirl franchise units due primarily to the foreclosure of U-Swirl in the prior year and the associated focus on reduction of duplicative franchise costs. As a percentage of total royalty and marketing fees and franchise fee revenue, franchise costs decreased to 22.0% in the three months ended August 31, 2016 from 23.9% in the three months ended August 31, 2015.   
     
  Sales and Marketing  
     
  The increase in sales and marketing costs for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015 is primarily due to higher marketing related compensation associated with additional sales staff partially offset by lower marketing-related costs associated with U-Swirl franchise locations.   
     
  General and Administrative  
     
  The decrease in general and administrative costs for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015 is due primarily to the foreclosure of U-Swirl in the prior year and the associated focus on reduction of duplicative general and administrative costs. For the three months ended August 31, 2016, approximately $98,000 of U-Swirl general and administrative costs were consolidated within our results, compared with $266,000 in the three months ended August 31, 2015. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 11.4% in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to 12.2% in the three months ended August 31, 2015.  
     
  Retail Operating Expenses  
     
  The decrease in retail operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015 was due primarily to changes in units in operation, resulting from the sale of certain Company-owned units and the closure of certain underperforming Company-owned units. Retail operating expenses, as a percentage of retail sales, decreased from 51.1% in the three months ended August 31, 2015 to 49.1% in the three months ended August 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily the result of the change in units in operation from the prior year.  
     
  Depreciation and Amortization  
     
  Depreciation and amortization of $318,000 in the three months ended August 31, 2016 decreased 10.7% from $356,000 incurred in the three months ended August 31, 2015. This decrease was the result of fewer Company-owned store assets in service.  
     
  Restructuring and Acquisition Related Charges  
     
  There were no restructuring and acquisition related charges during the three months ended August 31, 2016 or 2015.   
     
  Other Income  
     
  Net interest expense was $33,000 in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to net interest expense of $42,600 incurred in the three months ended August 31, 2015. This change was the result of less interest expense incurred on lower average outstanding promissory note balances.  
     
  Income Tax Expense  
     
  Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended August 31, 2016 was 35.9%, compared to 25.1% for the three months ended August 31, 2015. The increase of 10.8% was primarily due to the tax consequences of a change in the controlling interest in SWRL and foreclosure upon the stock of U-Swirl. For the three months ended August 31, 2015, the financial statements presented represent the consolidated statements of two separate consolidated groups for income tax purposes. The Company has filed income tax returns consolidating the results of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ALY. SWRL has filed a separate consolidated income tax return for the results of SWRL and its wholly owned subsidiary, U-Swirl. RMCF and SWRL have filed separate income tax returns because RMCF owned only 39% of SWRL. Beginning on March 1, 2016, the results of U-Swirl will be included in RMCF s consolidated income tax return, and on the same date, will be removed from SWRL s consolidated tax return. This is a result of the foreclosure of RMCF on the outstanding stock of U-Swirl in satisfaction of debt between RMCF and SWRL. The consolidated tax return for RMCF for future periods will include all operating results of U-Swirl. SWRL will file separate income tax returns in future periods, however, there are no remaining operating assets held by SWRL.

U-Swirl has significant net operating loss carryovers. In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, deductibility of U-Swirl s U.S. net operating loss carryovers may be subject to annual limitation in the event of a change in control. We have performed a preliminary evaluation as to whether a change in control has taken place, and have concluded that there was a change of control with respect to the net operating losses of U-Swirl when the Company acquired a 60% ownership interest in January 2013.   
       
   Six Months Ended August 31, 201  6   Compared to the Six Months Ended August 31, 201  5   
     
  Basic earnings per share increased 11.5% to $0.29 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $0.26 for the six months ended August 31, 2015. Revenues decreased 8.5% to $18.0 million for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $19.6 million in the six months ended August 31, 2015. Operating income decreased 11.9% from $3.1 million in the six months ended August 31, 2015 to $2.7 million in the six months ended August 31, 2016. Net income increased 10.6% from $1.5 million in the six months ended August 31, 2015 to $1.7 million in the six months ended August 31, 2016.   The decrease in operating income was due primarily to lower revenue in the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. This decrease was more than offset by no amount of net income being attributable to non-controlling interest.  

Factory Sales   
     
  The decrease in factory sales for the six months ended August 31, 2016 versus the six months ended August 31, 2015 was primarily due to a 26.7% decrease in shipments of product to customers outside our network of franchised retail stores, a 3.0% decrease in the average number of domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchised stores in operation, and a 3.7% decrease in same-store pounds purchased by our network of franchise and license stores. Revenue from one customer of the Company s Manufacturing segment represented approximately $1.5 million, or 14.4% of factory sales, during the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to revenue of $2.3 million, or 20.2% of factory sales, from the same customer in the six months ended August 31, 2015.   
     
  Retail Sales   
     
  The decrease in retail sales was primarily due to changes in retail units in operation resulting from the sale of certain Company-owned locations and the closure of a certain underperforming Company-owned location. Same store sales at all Company-owned stores and caf s increased 0.9% in the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. Same-store sales at U-Swirl caf s decreased 0.5% in the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015.  
     
  Royalties, Marketing Fees and Franchise Fees  
     
  The decrease in royalties and marketing fees from the six months ended August 31, 2015 to the six months ended August 31, 2016 resulted from an 11.0% decrease in franchise units in operation and lower same store sales. The average number of total franchise stores in operation decreased from 437 in the six months ended August 31, 2015 to 389 during the six months ended August 31, 2016.   This decrease is the result of domestic store closures exceeding domestic store openings. Same store sales at total franchise stores and caf s in operation decreased 0.2% during the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. Franchise fee revenues decreased as a result of the license fees associated with the license agreements for the development and franchising of CherryBerry stores in the Canadian province of Ontario being recognized in the six months ended August 31, 2015 and no international license fees being recognized in the six months ended August 31, 2016.

Additionally, we use adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin rather than gross margin and factory gross margin to make incremental pricing decisions. Adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin have limitations as analytical tools because they exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization expense and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for any measure reported under GAAP. Our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate income. Due to these limitations, we use adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin as measures of performance only in conjunction with GAAP measures of performance such as gross margin and factory gross margin. The following table provides a reconciliation of factory adjusted gross margin to factory gross margin, the most comparable performance measure under GAAP:  

Costs and Expenses  
     
  Cost of Sales   
     
  Factory margins decreased 10 basis points in the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015 due primarily to lower costs of certain materials more than offset by increased costs of labor and overhead in the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease in Company-owned store margin is due primarily to a decrease in Company-owned caf  revenue resulting from the sale of yogurt and the associated higher margins. This change is the result of a   change in units in operation during the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.   
     
  Franchise Costs   
     
  The decrease in franchise costs in the six months ended August 31, 2016 versus the six months ended August 31, 2015 is due primarily to lower franchise costs associated with supporting U-Swirl franchise units due primarily to the foreclosure of U-Swirl in the prior year and the associated focus on reduction of duplicative franchise costs. As a percentage of total royalty and marketing fees and franchise fee revenue, franchise costs decreased to 22.7% in the six months ended August 31, 2016 from 23.4% in the six months ended August 31, 2015. This decrease as a percentage of royalty, marketing and franchise fees is primarily a result of lower franchise costs.  

20

Sales and Marketing  
     
  The increase in sales and marketing costs for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015 is primarily due to higher marketing related compensation associated with additional sales staff partially offset by lower marketing-related costs associated with U-Swirl franchise locations.  
     
  General and Administrative   
     
  The decrease in general and administrative costs for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015 is due primarily to the foreclosure of U-Swirl in the prior year and the associated focus on reduction of duplicative general and administrative costs. For the six months ended August 31, 2016, approximately $261,000 of U-Swirl general and administrative costs were consolidated within our results, compared with $669,000 in the six months ended August 31, 2015. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 12.4% in the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to 12.5% in the six months ended August 31, 2015.  
     
  Retail Operating Expenses  
     
  The decrease in retail operating expenses for the six months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015 was due primarily to changes in units in operation, resulting from the sale of certain Company-owned units and the closure of certain underperforming Company-owned units. Retail operating expenses, as a percentage of retail sales, decreased from 55.6% in the six months ended August 31, 2015 to 50.9% in the six months ended August 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily the result of the change in units in operation from the prior year.  
     
  Depreciation and Amortization  
     
  Depreciation and amortization of $643,000 in the six months ended August 31, 2016 decreased 10.8% from $721,000 incurred in the six months ended August 31, 2015. This decrease was the result of fewer Company-owned store assets in service.  
     
  Restructuring and acquisition related charges  
     
  Restructuring and acquisition related charges of $60,000 during the six months ended August 31, 2016 increased from $0 during the six months ended August 31, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of lease settlement costs related to the closure of an ALY company-owned location.  
     
  Other Income  
     
  Net interest expense was $69,000 in the six months ended August 31, 2016, a decrease of 21.4% compared to net interest expense of $87,800 in the six months ended August 31, 2015. This change was the result of less interest expense incurred on lower average outstanding promissory note balances.  
     
  Income Tax Expense  
     
  Our effective income tax rate for the six months ended August 31, 2016 was 36.0%, compared to 28.0% for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The increase of 8.0% is primarily due to the tax consequences of a change in the controlling interest in SWRL and foreclosure upon the stock of U-Swirl. For the six months ended August 31, 2015, the financial statements presented represent the consolidated statements of two separate consolidated groups for income tax purposes. The Company has filed income tax returns consolidating the results of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ALY. SWRL has filed a separate consolidated income tax return for the results of SWRL and its wholly owned subsidiary, U-Swirl. RMCF and SWRL have filed separate income tax returns because RMCF owned only 39% of SWRL. Beginning on March 1, 2016, the results of U-Swirl will be included in RMCF s consolidated income tax return, and on the same date, will be removed from SWRL s consolidated tax return. This is a result of the foreclosure of RMCF on the outstanding stock of U-Swirl in satisfaction of debt between RMCF and SWRL. The consolidated tax return for RMCF for future periods will include all operating results of U-Swirl. SWRL will file separate income tax returns in future periods, however, there are no remaining operating assets held by SWRL.   
     
  U-Swirl has significant net operating loss carryovers. In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, deductibility of U-Swirl s U.S. net operating loss carryovers may be subject to annual limitation in the event of a change in control. We have performed a preliminary evaluation as to whether a change in control has taken place, and have concluded that there was a change of control with respect to the net operating losses of U-Swirl when the Company acquired a 60% ownership interest in January 2013.   

21

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  As of August 31, 2016, working capital was $6.8 million, compared with $7.4 million as of February 29, 2016, a decrease of $0.6 million. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to operating results more than offset by the payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock.  
       
  Cash and cash equivalent balances decreased $1.3 million from $6.2 million as of February 29, 2016 to $4.9 million as of August 31, 2016 as a result of cash flow used by financing activities, including repayment of indebtedness, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. Our current ratio was 1.8 to 1 at August 31, 2016 and 1.9 to 1 at February 29, 2016. We monitor current and anticipated future levels of cash and cash equivalents in relation to anticipated operating, financing and investing requirements.  
     
  For the six months ended August 31, 2016, we had net income of $1,706,647. Operating activities provided cash of $2,153,553, with the principal adjustment to reconcile the net income to net cash provided by operating activities being depreciation and amortization of $642,907 and the change in inventory of ($708,428). During the comparable 2015 period, we had net income of $2,173,579, and operating activities provided cash of $3,968,432. The principal adjustment to reconcile the net income to net cash provided by operating activities was depreciation and amortization of $720,663 and stock compensation expense of $468,386.   
     
  For the six months ended August 31, 2016, investing activities used cash of $1,065,034, primarily due to the purchases of property, equipment of $931,989. In comparison, investing activities used cash of $314,290 during the six months ended August 31, 2015 primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment of $322,373.  
     
  Financing activities used cash of $2,406,680 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and used cash of $4,900,918 during the prior year period. This was primarily due to decreased cash used to repurchase common stock during the six months ended August 31, 2016.   
     
  We have a $5.0 million ($5.0 million available as of August 31, 2016) working capital line of credit collateralized by substantially all of our assets with the exception of our retail store assets. Additionally, the line of credit is subject to various financial ratio and leverage covenants. As of August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants.   The line of credit is subject to renewal in September 2017. As of August 31, 2016, no amount was outstanding under this line of credit.  
     
  The Company s long-term debt is comprised of a promissory note used to finance business acquisitions of SWRL (unpaid balance as of August 31, 2016, $4.5 million). The note allowed the Company to borrow up to a maximum of $7.0 million to finance business acquisitions and bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 3.75%. Additionally, the promissory note is subject to various financial ratio and leverage covenants. As of August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants.   
     
  As discussed above, in FY 2014, SWRL acquired the franchise rights and certain other assets of self-serve frozen yogurt concepts under the names  CherryBerry,   Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt  and  Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt.  In connection with these acquisitions, the Company entered into a credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. used to finance the acquisitions of SWRL, and in turn, the Company entered into the SWRL Loan Agreement with SWRL. Borrowings under the SWRL Loan Agreement were secured by all of the assets of SWRL, including all of the outstanding stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, U-Swirl. Under the SWRL Loan Agreement, SWRL was subject to various financial covenants. SWRL was not compliant with the financial covenants during the year ended February 29, 2016 and the loan matured on January 16, 2016 without payment in full by SWRL. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, we were entitled to charge interest on all amounts due under the SWRL Loan Agreement at the default rate of 15% per annum, accelerate payment of all amounts due under the SWRL Loan Agreement, and foreclose on all or any portion of the security interest. As a result of the defaults, we issued a demand for payment of all obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement. SWRL was unable to repay the obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement, and as a result, we foreclosed on all of the outstanding stock of U-Swirl as of February 29, 2016 in full satisfaction of the amounts owed under the SWRL Loan Agreement. This resulted in U-Swirl becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company as of February 29, 2016, and concurrently the Company ceased to have financial control of SWRL as of February 29, 2016. As of February 29, 2016, SWRL had no operating assets.   
     
  On July 15, 2014, the Company publicly announced a plan to repurchase up to $3.0 million of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, whenever deemed appropriate by management. On January 13, 2015, the Company announced a plan to purchase up to an additional $2,058,000 of its common stock under the repurchase plan, and on May 21, 2015, the Company announced a further increase to the repurchase plan by authorizing the purchase of up to an additional $2,090,000 of its common stock under the repurchase plan. During the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 35,108 shares under the repurchase plan at an average price of $10.01 per share. As of August 31, 2016, approximately $638,121 remains available under the repurchase plan for further stock repurchases.   
     
  We believe cash flows generated by operating activities and available financing will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. If necessary, the Company has an available bank line of credit to help meet these requirements.  

22

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  As of August 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.  
     
   Impact of Inflation   
     
  Inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of ingredients and labor directly affect our operations. Most of our leases provide for cost-of-living adjustments and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, our future lease costs for new facilities may include potentially escalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on increased costs to our customers.  
     
  Depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to us of our fixed assets, and is therefore potentially less than it would be if it were based on current replacement cost. While property and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at higher prices, it is expected that replacement will be a gradual process over many years.  
       
   Seasonality   
     
  The Company is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales, which cause fluctuations in quarterly results of operations. Historically, the strongest sales of the Company s products have occurred during key holidays and the summer vacation season. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings and sales of franchises. Because of the seasonality of the Company s business and the impact of new store openings and sales of franchises, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year.   
     
   Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
     
  We do not engage in commodity futures trading or hedging activities and do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. We also do not engage in transactions in foreign currencies or in interest rate swap transactions that could expose us to market risk. However, we are exposed to some commodity price and interest rate risks.  
     
  We frequently enter into purchase contracts of between six to eighteen months for chocolate and certain nuts. These contracts permit us to purchase the specified commodity at a fixed price on an as-needed basis during the term of the contract. Because prices for these products may fluctuate, we may benefit if prices rise during the terms of these contracts, but we may be required to pay above-market prices if prices fall and we are unable to renegotiate the terms of the contract. As of August 31, 2016, based on future contractual obligations for ingredients, we estimate that a 10.0% change in the prices of contracted ingredients would result in a $176,000 favorable or unfavorable price benefit or cost, respectively, resulting from our contracts.  
     
  The Company has a $5 million bank line of credit that bears interest at a variable rate. As of August 31, 2016, no amount was outstanding under the line of credit. We do not believe that we are exposed to any material interest rate risk related to this line of credit.  
     
  The Company also entered into a $7.0 million promissory note with interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% annually to finance the previous acquisitions by SWRL. As of August 31, 2016, $4.5 million was outstanding under this promissory note. We do not believe that we are exposed to any material interest rate risk related to this promissory note.   
     
   Item 4.     Controls and Procedures   
       
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
       
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify as to our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

23

Company management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of August 31, 2016.  
       
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   Item 1.       Legal Proceedings   
     
  From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Except as described below, we are not presently a party to any litigation that we believe to be material and we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.  
     
  In January 2014, SWRL entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  CherryBerry Purchase Agreement ) with CherryBerry Enterprises LLC, CherryBerry Corporate LLC, CherryBerry LLC (collectively, the  CherryBerry Entities ), and their respective owners (collectively, the  CherryBerry Selling Parties ), pursuant to which SWRL acquired the franchise rights of frozen yogurt stores branded as  CherryBerry  (the  CherryBerry Acquisition ). As a part of the consideration for the CherryBerry Acquisition, SWRL agreed to issue an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of SWRL common stock (the  CB Shares ) to the CherryBerry Selling Parties, which were subject to a one-year lock-up agreement. The CB Shares were issued to the CherryBerry Selling Parties in February 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement, following expiration of the lock-up period, if any of the CherryBerry Selling Parties desired to sell their CB Shares, they must first offer such shares to SWRL and RMCF prior to any sale of the CB Shares on the open market. If the proceeds from the sale of any of the CB Shares is less than $0.50 per share and the CherryBerry Selling Parties comply with other terms of the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement, SWRL agreed to pay a shortfall payment equal to the difference of the sale price of the CB Shares and $0.50 per share, multiplied by the number of shares sold by the CherryBerry Selling Parties. If SWRL had been required to pay the shortfall payment on February 29, 2016, the shortfall payment would have been approximately $1,800,000. SWRL determined the likelihood of incurring the liability to be less than probable and has not recorded a contingent liability at February 29, 2016. In July and August 2015, the CherryBerry Selling Parties submitted to SWRL several requests for payment of approximately $205,000 of shortfall payments based on the sale of a portion of the CB Shares.   
     
  In August 2015, SWRL filed a lawsuit against the CherryBerry Selling Parties, a former officer and director of SWRL and unknown other parties, in the District Court for La Plata County, Colorado, alleging wrongful actions on their part to cause the price of SWRL s common stock to decline and thereafter making an improper demand for the shortfall payment described above, and certain other actions in violation of various provisions of the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement. SWRL sought unspecified damages, attorney s fees, other costs, and a determination that the shortfall payment arrangement is void. In September 2015, the CherryBerry Selling Parties filed an answer and counterclaim to the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, and moved the lawsuit to federal court in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (the  Colorado District Court ). In addition, the CherryBerry Entities added RMCF to the lawsuit through a third-party complaint. The complaint alleged that SWRL materially breached the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement by not paying the shortfall payment, that SWRL is the alter ego of RMCF and RMCF is liable for any obligations of SWRL, and that the SWRL Loan Agreement should be recharacterized as equity. The CherryBerry Entities sought payment in full of the shortfall payment under the CherryBerry Purchase Agreement, declaratory judgements that SWRL is the alter ego of RMCF and the SWRL Loan Agreement should be recharacterized as equity, and interest, attorney s fees, costs and other equitable relief.   
     
   On January 13, 2016, the CherryBerry Entities dismissed without prejudice their counterclaim and third-party complaint from the Colorado District Court, and thereafter on January 13, 2016, the CherryBerry Entities refiled the exact claims (the  Oklahoma Action ) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma (the  Oklahoma Court ). Also on January 13, 2016, RMCF filed a lawsuit against the CherryBerry Entities in the Colorado District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that it is not the alter ego of SWRL and that the SWRL Loan Agreement should not be re-characterized as equity (the  Colorado Action ). On that same date, SWRL filed a complaint against the CherryBerry Selling Parties asserting the same claims as it had asserted previously. RMCF filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue and in the alternative a motion to transfer venue in response to the Oklahoma Action, and the CherryBerry Selling Parties subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the Colorado Action. In April 2016, the Colorado District Court granted in part the CherryBerry Selling Parties  motion and administratively closed the case. In addition, in April 2016, the Oklahoma Court denied RMCF s motion (and SWRL s similar motion). On April 8, 2016, the CherryBerry Entities moved to add RMCF as a defendant on the alter ego and re-characterization claims in the Oklahoma Action. On May 9, 2016, the Oklahoma Court granted that application. We intend to vigorously assert and defend our rights in this lawsuit.

Item 1A.     Risk Factors   
     
  In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part 1,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.  
     
   Item 2.        Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   
     
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities    

(1)     On July 15, 2014, the Company publicly announced a plan to repurchase up to $3.0 million of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions, whenever deemed appropriate by management. On January 13, 2015, the Company announced a plan to purchase up to an additional $2,058,000 of its common stock under the repurchase plan, and on May 21, 2015, the Company announced a further increase to the repurchase plan by authorizing the purchase of up to an additional $2,090,000 of its common stock under the repurchase plan. The Company plans to continue the repurchase plan until it has been completed. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at the Company s sole discretion and future repurchases will be evaluated by the Company depending on market conditions, liquidity needs and other factors. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock. The Board of Directors may suspend, modify or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
