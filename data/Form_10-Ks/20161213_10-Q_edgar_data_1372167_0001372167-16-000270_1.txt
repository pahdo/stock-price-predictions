Part I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Pan Ocean Container Supplies, Ltd.   

  Formerly Known as Neveah Enterprises Ltd.  

  Notes to the Financial Statements  

  For the Six Months Ended October 31, 2016  

1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS  

 Pan Ocean Container Supplies Ltd., (the  Company )
was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 15, 2006. The Company intends to operate as a shipping container manufacturer to
be based in China, which will sell or lease its containers to multi-national corporations that are involved with the transportation
of commercial and consumer goods. Secondary activities that will support our operations will include the research and development
of new shipping container products. The Company is also planning on implementing the most modern manufacturing concept of shipping
container production with a high quality product assurance system. 

 These financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis. The Company has accumulated a deficit of $145,343 since inception and has yet to achieve profitable operations
and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business, raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate
profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management plans to continue to provide for its working capital needs
by seeking loans from its shareholders. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of assets, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern. 

 The Company s year-end is April 30. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because a precise determination of
many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves
the use of estimates, which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates. 

 The financial statements have, in management s
opinion, been properly prepared within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below: 

  Cash and Cash Equivalents  

 Cash equivalents comprise certain highly liquid instruments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. 

  Reclassification  

 Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net income
or losses. 

Impairment of Long Lived Assets  

 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance
with ASC Topic 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long- lived Assets . Under ASC Topic 360, long-lived
assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. An impairment charge is recognized or the amount, if any, which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. 

Foreign Currency Translation  

 The Company is located and operating outside of the
United States of America. It maintains its accounting records in U.S. Dollars, as follows: 

 At the transaction date, each asset, liability, revenue,
and expense is translated into U.S. dollars by the use of exchange rates in effect at that date. At the period end, monetary assets
and liabilities are re-measured by using the exchange rate in effect at that date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses
are included in operations. 

 The Company s currency exposure is insignificant
and immaterial and we do not use derivative instruments to reduce its potential exposure to foreign currency risk. 

Financial Instruments  

 The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments
consisting of cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant
interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. 

Income Taxes  

 The Company uses the assets and liability method of
accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB Topic 740  Accounting for Income Taxes . Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial
statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share  

 In accordance with FASB Topic 260,  Earnings Per
Share', the basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed similar to basic net loss per common share except
that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As at October 31, 2016, diluted net loss per share
is equivalent to basic net loss per share. 

Stock Based Compensation  

 The Company accounts for stock options and similar
equity instruments issued in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Compensation- Stock Compensation. Accordingly, compensation costs attributable
to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the
expected vesting period. Transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for the issuance of equity instruments
are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable, ASC Topic 718 requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a
reduction of taxes paid.  

 The Company did not grant any stock options during
the period ended October 31, 2016. 

Comprehensive Income  

 The Company adopted FASB Topic 220- Comprehensive Income,
which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. The Company
is disclosing this information on its Statement of Stockholders' Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting
from investments by owners and distributions to owners. 

 The Company has no elements of  other comprehensive
income  during the period ended October 31, 2016. 

Advertising Expenses   

 The company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
There was no advertising expense incurred by the company during the period ended October 31, 2016. 

New Accounting Standards   

 In August, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40), which now requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial
statements are issued. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern,
and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration of management's plans, additional disclosures are required. The amendments
in this update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early application is permitted. These requirements were previously included within auditing standards and federal securities law,
but are now included within U.S. GAAP. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 on our financial
statements and disclosures. 

 In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development
Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest
Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity
from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between
development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. For public business entities, those amendments are effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early application of each of the amendments
is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity s financial statements have not yet been
issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption, entities will no longer present
or disclose any information required by Topic 915.  

 The Company believes that there were no other accounting
standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

3. CAPITAL STOCK  

 On August 1, 2006, the Company issued 32,000,000 common
shares at $0.000125 per share to the sole director of the Company for total proceeds of $4,000. 

 On April 30, 2009, the Company issued 12,000,000 common
shares at $0.00125 per share for total proceeds of $15,000. 

 On March 28, 2014, the Company effected an increase
of its authorized common shares to 500,000,000 shares at $0.001 par value. 

 On July 10, 2014, the Company effected an 8-for-1 forward
stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the  Forward Stock Split ). All references
to number of shares and per share amounts included in the financial statements and the accompanying notes have been adjusted to
reflect the Forward Stock Split retroactively. 

 On June 10, 2016, the Company effected a 500:1 Reverse
Stock Split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. 

4. RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTIONS   

 The sole officer and director of the Company, Mr. Qi
Tang, has in his receipt, the funds of $15,000 related the capital stock issuance on January 1, 2009. The amount of the $15,000
was applied against the Company s loan owing to Mr. Tang of $10,949. Accordingly, $4,051 of funds remains from the proceeds
from the share issuance. These funds are in his safe custody pending the opening of a company bank account. 

5. COMMITMENTS   CONTINGENCIES  

 On June 20, 2006, the management of the Company signed
a software design contract with Zhou Li Hong, an independent software designer to create and develop a software design for the
Company. In consideration, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Zhou a fixed fee of $8,000, which is due upon the completion of the beta

terms and conditions of the Agreement, Pan Ocean shareholders will acquire six million (6,000,000) shares of the Company s
common stock, in order to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The closing of the transaction in the Agreement are
contingent upon satisfaction of certain conditions listed in the Agreement. On March 1, 2016, the Company terminated the Agreement
with Pan Ocean. 

6. CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE  

 On October 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Line
of Credit agreement with Fusion Business Group Inc. The agreement provides for a line of credit of $100,000 available for working
capital purposes. The credit line bears no interest and is payable on demand. The loan may also be forgiven conversion into common
shares at an exercise price of $0.10 per share upon. The conversion would require mutual consent by both parties to allow the debt
holder to convert into common shares. On July 13, 2015, the Line of Credit agreement with Fusion Business Group Inc. was amended
to increase the available amount to $200,000. As of October 31, 2016, the Company has a balance of $114,153 on the line of credit
account with Fusion Business Group Inc.

COMPANY OVERVIEW  

Pan Ocean Container Supplies, Ltd. was incorporated in the state
of Nevada on June 15, 2006. Our initial business plan was to operate as a software developer which will create a software interface
which will integrate existing cellular phone devices with an automobile's existing navigation system in order to relay text or
email message through an automobile's sound system or navigation display. 

On July 10, 2014, we executed an agreement with the Pan Ocean (China)
(the  Agreement ), whereby pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Pan Ocean (China) shareholders will
acquire six million (6,000,000) shares of our common stock, in order to become a wholly owned subsidiary. The closing of the transaction
in the Agreement are contingent upon satisfaction of certain conditions listed in the Agreement. On March 1, 2016, the Company
terminated the Agreement with Pan Ocean. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

We have not generated any revenues for the six months ended October
31, 2016. 

We incurred general and administration expenses of $1,040 for the
six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to general and administration expenses of $2,390 for the six months ended October 31,
2015. The decrease in expenses is a result of a decrease in professional expenses. 

For the six months ended October 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss
of $ 1,040.    

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

As of October 31, 2016, we had assets of $ 4,051 and liabilities
of $ 130,394. During the six month period ended October 31, 2016, the Company satisfied its working capital needs from loans
payable to financial corporation. 

As of October 31, 2016, we had cash on hand in the amount of $ 4,051.
Management does not expect that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operation for the next twelve-month
period. In the event that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors have agreed to advance
us sufficient capital to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain more future loans from our shareholders,
but there are no agreements or understandings in place currently. 

We believe that we will require additional funding to expand our
business and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing
from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any agreements in place for any future equity financing. In the event
we are not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain shor t -term loans from our director. 

Related Party Transactions  

Our sole officer and director, Mr. Qi Tang, has in his receipt, the
funds of $15,000 related the capital stock issuance on January 1, 2009. The amount of the $15,000 was applied against our loan
owing to Mr. Tang of $10,949. Accordingly, $4,051 of funds remains from the proceeds from the share issuance. These funds are in
his safe custody pending the opening of a company bank account. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
