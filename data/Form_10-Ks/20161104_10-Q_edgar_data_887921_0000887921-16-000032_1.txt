Item 1.  Financial Statements 

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
         Revlon, Inc. ("Revlon" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") conducts its business exclusively through its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation ("Products Corporation"), and its subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden, Inc. ("Elizabeth Arden").  Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews   Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, "MacAndrews   Forbes"), a corporation wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman.  We are a leading global beauty company with an iconic portfolio of brands. We manufacture, market and sell an extensive array of color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, fragrances, skincare, beauty tools, men s grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants and other beauty care products across a variety of distribution channels. The Company is building a combined organization that is entrepreneurial, agile and boldly creative, with a passion for beauty. The Company has strategic brand builders developing a diverse portfolio of iconic brands that delight consumers around the world wherever and however they shop for beauty. The Company strives to be an ethical company that values inclusive leadership and is committed to sustainable and responsible growth.  The Company operates in   four   reporting segments: the consumer division ( Consumer  the professional division ( Professional  Elizabeth Arden; and Other (each as described below). The Company manufactures, markets and sells worldwide an extensive array of beauty and personal care products, including color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, beauty tools, men's grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants, fragrances, skincare and other beauty care products. The Company s principal customers for its products in the Consumer segment include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Company's principal customers for its products in the Professional segment include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally.   
  On September 7, 2016 (the "Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of Elizabeth Arden (the  Elizabeth Arden Acquisition ). Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of brands that are highly complementary to the Company's existing brand portfolio and are sold worldwide.  In North America, Elizabeth Arden s principal customers include prestige retailers, the mass retail channel and distributors, as well as direct sales to consumers via its branded retail outlet stores and e-commerce business.  Elizabeth Arden products are also sold through the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas.  Internationally, Elizabeth Arden s portfolio of owned and licensed brands is sold to perfumeries, boutiques, department stores, travel retailers and distributors.  The operating results and purchase accounting for the Company's Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are presented in the Elizabeth Arden segment.   Refer to Note 2, "Business Combinations," for further details related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. 
  The Other segment primarily includes the operating results of the CBBeauty Group and certain of its related entities, which the Company acquired in April 2015, (collectively "CBB" and such transaction, the "CBB Acquisition").  CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under a variety of celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. 
  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited. In management's opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been made. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company after the elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions. 
  The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Significant estimates made in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include, but are not limited to, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, expected sales returns and allowances, trade support costs, certain assumptions related to the valuation of acquired intangible and long-lived assets and the recoverability of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, income taxes, including deferred tax valuation allowances and reserves for estimated tax liabilities, restructuring costs, certain estimates and assumptions used in the calculation of the net periodic benefit (income) costs and the projected benefit obligations for the Company s pension and other post-retirement plans, including the expected long-term return on pension plan assets and the discount rate used to value the Company s pension benefit obligations. The Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Revlon, Inc.'s 2015 Form 10-K. 
  The Company's results of operations and financial position for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for a full year.

Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
   In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent within a company's balance sheet. Under previous guidance, the Company was required to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts. Netting deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by tax jurisdiction is still required under ASU 2015-17.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the Company's previously recorded deferred tax assets were adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17.  The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 resulted in no adjustment to the Company s results of operations and stockholders  deficiency and had the following impact on the previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments," which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures. 
    
  In  April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the financial statements as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the Company's previously recorded other assets and long-term debt were adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 resulted in no adjustment to the Company s results of operations, cash flows and stockholders  deficiency and had the following impact on the previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015:

  (except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern," that will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. According to ASU No. 2014-15, substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date. The likelihood threshold of "probable," similar to its current use in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies, will be used to define substantial doubt. Disclosures will be required under ASU No. 2014-15 if conditions give rise to substantial doubt, including whether and how management's plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-15 beginning January 1, 2016 and the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Receipts and Cash Payments  which aims to standardize how certain transactions are classified within the Statement of Cash Flows, including, among other issues, debt prepayment and extinguishment costs and contingent consideration payments made after a business combination. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-15 beginning on January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including transactions in which an employee uses shares to satisfy the employer s minimum statutory income tax withholding obligation, forfeitures and income taxes when awards vest or are settled. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-09 beginning on January 1, 2017 and is in the process of assessing the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs. Leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-02 beginning on January 1, 2019 and is in the process of assessing the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.

Purchase Price Allocation 
  The Company accounted for the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition as a business combination during the third quarter of 2016 and, accordingly, the total consideration of   $1,034.3 million   has been recorded based on the respective estimated fair values of the net 
  assets acquired on the Acquisition Date with resulting goodwill, as follows: 

(a)      The Company recorded a   $40.7 million   step-up for the estimated fair value of Elizabeth Arden s inventory, which has been determined based upon the estimated selling price of the inventories less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. Following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the step-up in fair value will increase cost of sales over approximately   seven months  , as the acquired inventory is sold.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a   $4.2 million   charge within cost of sales related to this step-up. 
    
   (b)    Deferred tax assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition primarily relate to approximately   $107.3 million   of tax loss carryforwards which the Company preliminarily estimates it will be able to realize in future periods, of which   $0.5 million   are foreign and   $106.8 million   are domestic (federal). 
    
  The fair values of the net assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition were based on management s preliminary estimate of the respective fair values of Elizabeth Arden s net assets. The estimated fair values of net assets and resulting goodwill are subject to the Company finalizing its analysis of the fair value of Elizabeth Arden s assets and liabilities as of the Acquisition Date and may be adjusted upon completion of such analysis. In addition, information unknown at the time of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition could result in adjustments to the respective fair values and resulting goodwill within the year following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. 
    
  In determining the fair values of net assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and resulting goodwill, the Company considered, among other factors, the analyses of Elizabeth Arden's historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business, as well as the intended use of the acquired assets. 
    
  The estimated fair value of the accounts receivable acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition was determined to be   $132.6 million  . The gross amount due is   $165.0 million   and the Company estimates that approximately   $32.4 million   is uncollectible. 
    
  The estimated fair value of inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition was determined using the income approach, specifically, the net realizable value ("NRV") approach, which calculates the estimated selling price of such inventory in the ordinary course of business, less the reasonable costs of completion, disposal and holding. The estimated fair value of acquired property and equipment was determined using the cost approach.

The intangible assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition based on the estimate of the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets are as follows: 

The estimate of the fair values of acquired indefinite-lived and finite-lived trade names and technology IP was determined using a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The relief-from-royalty method requires identifying the hypothetical cash flows generated by an assumed royalty rate that a third party would pay to license the trade names and IP, and discounting them back to the Acquisition Date. The royalty rate used in such valuation was based on a consideration of market rates for similar categories of assets. The indefinite-lived trade names includes the Elizabeth Arden brand trade name. The finite-lived trade names includes, among others, owned heritage fragrance trade names such as Curve, Halston and Giorgio Beverly Hills and the Prevage skin care brand.  
    
  The estimate of the fair value of the customer and distributor relationships and distribution rights acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition were determined using a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow model, specifically, the excess earnings method which considers the use of other assets in the generation of the projected cash flows of a specific asset to isolate the economic benefit generated by the customer and distribution relationships and distribution rights. The contribution of other assets, such as fixed assets, working capital, workforce and other intangible assets, to overall cash flows was estimated through contributory asset capital charges. Therefore, the value of the acquired customer relationship is the present value of the attributed post-tax cash flows, net of the return on fair value attributed to tangible and other intangible assets. 
    
  There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including, the selection of appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. 
    
  The Company recorded a   $59.2 million   deferred tax liability related to the   $332.8 million   of acquired intangible assets outlined in the above table. This deferred tax liability represents the tax effect of the difference between the   $332.8 million   estimated assigned fair value of the intangible assets and the   $148.6 million   tax basis of such assets.  The goodwill and intangibles acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are not     expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
    
  Goodwill of   $202.0 million   represents the excess of the purchase price paid by Products Corporation for the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired by Products Corporation in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Factors contributing to the purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include estimated annualized synergies and cost reductions, expanded category mix, channel diversification and a broader geographic footprint.

Unaudited Pro Forma Results 
    
  The following table presents the Company's pro forma consolidated net sales and income from continuing operations, before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The unaudited pro forma results include the historical consolidated statements of operations of the Company and Elizabeth Arden, giving effect to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and related financing transactions as if they had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. As stated below, the Company also acquired certain international Cutex businesses ("Cutex International"); however the Company has not included the Cutex International results prior to its acquisition date in these pro forma results as the impact would not have been material to the Company's financial results. 

The pro forma results, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, include the following pro forma adjustments related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition: 
    
  (i) as a result of a   $40.7 million   increase in the fair value of acquired inventory at the Acquisition Date, the Company recognized a   $4.2 million   increase in the cost of sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the consolidated financial statements. The pro forma adjustments include an adjustment to reverse the   $4.2 million   recognized in the third quarter of 2016 within cost of sales because it will not have a recurring impact; 
    
  (ii) a pro forma increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the preliminary fair value adjustments to property and equipment of   $2.6 million   and acquired finite-lived intangible assets of   $1.0 million   recorded in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; 
    
  (iii) a pro forma decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the preliminary fair value adjustments to property and equipment of   $1.4 million   and acquired finite-lived intangible assets of   $5.0 million   recorded in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively; 
    
  (iv) the elimination of   $58.4 million   of acquisition costs and   $65.1 million   of integration costs recognized by the Company and Elizabeth Arden during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; and 
    
  (v) a pro forma increase in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs, related to financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and related debt restructuring transactions as summarized in the following table.

In addition, the unaudited pro forma results do not purport to project the future consolidated operating results of the combined company. 
    
  The Cutex International Acquisition 
  On May 31, 2016 (the "Cutex International Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of certain international Cutex businesses ("Cutex International") from Coty Inc. (the "Cutex International Acquisition"), which primarily operate in Australia and the U.K., and related assets for total cash consideration of   $29.1 million  .  Following the Company's October 2015 acquisition of the Cutex business and related assets in the U.S. from Cutex Brands, LLC, the Cutex International Acquisition completed the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand and enhances and complements the Company's existing brand portfolio of nail care products. Cutex International's results of operations are included in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the Cutex International Acquisition Date. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented, as the impact of the Cutex International Acquisition on the Company s consolidated financial results is not material.  
  The Company accounted for the Cutex International Acquisition as a business combination in the second quarter of 2016. The table below summarizes the allocation of the total consideration of   $29.1 million   paid on the Cutex International Acquisition Date, as well as adjustments that have been made to the preliminary estimate of fair values during the third quarter of 2016:  

(a)      As previously reported in Revlon's second quarter 2016 Form 10-Q. 
    
   (b)      Purchased intangible assets include customer networks fair valued at   $13.5 million  , intellectual property fair valued at   $0.9 million  , which are amortized over useful lives of   15   and   10   years, respectively, and indefinite lived trade names fair valued at   $5.1 million  .

The Company reacquired the Cutex trade name from Coty, which had previously provided Coty with an exclusive right to manufacture, market and sell Cutex branded products for an initial term and perpetual automatic   20  -year renewals. Based on the terms and conditions of the existing license agreements and other factors, the Cutex trade name was assigned an indefinite-life and, therefore, will not be amortized. 
  In determining the estimated fair values of net assets acquired and resulting goodwill related to the Cutex International Acquisition, the Company considered, among other factors, the analysis of Cutex International's historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business, as well as the intended use of the acquired assets.  Factors contributing to the purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include the anticipated benefits that the Company expects to achieve through the expansion of its nail product portfolio.  Both the intangible assets acquired in the Cutex International Acquisition and goodwill are not deductible for income tax purposes. 

3. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  
  2015 Efficiency Program 
  In September 2015, the Company initiated certain restructuring actions to drive certain organizational efficiencies across the Company's Consumer and Professional segments (the "2015 Efficiency Program"). These actions, which commenced during 2015 and are planned to occur through 2017, are expected to reduce general and administrative expenses within the Consumer and Professional segments. Of the   $1.5 million   of restructuring and related charges recognized in the first nine months of 2016 for the 2015 Efficiency Program,   $0.6 million   related to the Consumer segment and   $0.5 million   related to the Professional segment, with the remaining charges included within unallocated corporate expenses.  The Company expects to recognize total restructuring and related charges for the 2015 Efficiency Program of   $12.0 million   by the end of 2017, of which   $7.0 million   is expected to relate to the Consumer segment,   $4.2 million   is expected to relate to the Professional segment and the remaining charge relates to unallocated corporate expenses. 
  A summary of the restructuring and related charges incurred through   September 30, 2016   in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program is presented in the following table:   

Of the cumulative   $11.0 million   of restructuring and related charges recognized through the third quarter of 2016 related to the 2015 Efficiency Program,   $6.6 million   related to the Consumer segment,   $3.7 million   related to the Professional segment and the remaining charges related to unallocated corporate expenses. 
  The Company expects that cash payments will total approximately   $12 million   in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program, including   $0.2 million   for capital expenditures (which capital expenditures are excluded from total restructuring and related charges expected to be recognized for the 2015 Efficiency Program), of which   $2.7 million   was paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $2.8 million   was paid in 2015. A total of   $4.2 million   is expected to be paid during the remainder of 2016, with the remaining balance expected to be paid in 2017.

         The Company completed several debt transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  In connection with and substantially concurrently with the closing of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (or the Senior Facilities).  Additionally, Products Corporation s   6.25%   Senior Notes, which closed on August 4, 2016 (the    6.25%   Senior Notes Offering ), were released from escrow (the  Escrow Release ). In connection with entering into the Senior Facilities, Products Corporation maintained on the 2016 Term Loan Facility its existing floating-to-fixed interest rate swap based on a notional amount of   $400 million   that previously applied to Products Corporation s Acquisition Term Loan.  The proceeds of Products Corporation's   6.25%   Senior Notes Offering and the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with approximately   $35.0 million   of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and approximately   $126.7 million   of cash on hand, were used to fund the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition (including: (i) repurchasing the entire $  350.0 million   aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Elizabeth Arden Existing Senior Notes; (ii) repaying the entire   $142.0 million   aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden s   $300.0 million   revolving credit facility; (iii) repaying the entire   $25.0 million   aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's second lien credit facility; and (iv) retiring   $55.0 million   liquidation preference of all of the issued and outstanding   50,000   shares of Elizabeth Arden Preferred Stock, which amount includes a   $5.0 million   change of control premium) and to completely refinance and repay all of the   $651.4 million   in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation s 2011 Term Loan and   $658.6 million   in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation s Acquisition Term Loan.  The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with repaying such facilities. 
    
  (i) 2016 Term Loan Facility 
  Principal and Maturity:   On the Acquisition Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative and collateral agent and which has an initial aggregate principal amount of   $1,800.0 million   and will mature on the earlier of (x) the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation s   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the    5.75%   Senior Notes ) if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation's   5.75%   Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation s available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding   5.75%   Senior Notes by at least   $200.0 million  .  The loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility were borrowed at an original issue discount of   0.5%   to their principal amount. The 2016 Term Loan Facility may be increased by an amount equal to the sum of (x) the greater of   $450.0 million   and   90%   of Products Corporation s pro forma consolidated EBITDA, plus (y) an unlimited amount to the extent that (1) the first lien leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation s net senior secured funded debt that is not junior or subordinated to the liens of the Senior Facilities to EBITDA) is less than or equal to   3.5   to 1.0 (for debt secured pari passu with the 2016 Term Loan Facility) or (2) the secured leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation s net senior secured funded debt to EBITDA) is less than or equal to   4.25   to 1.0 (for junior lien or unsecured debt), plus (z) up to an additional   $400.0 million   if the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has been repaid and terminated. 
    
  Guarantees and Security:   Products Corporation and the restricted subsidiaries under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which include Products Corporation s domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and its domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the  Restricted

Group ), are subject to the covenants under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement.  The 2016 Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by each existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of Products Corporation (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon, on a limited recourse basis.  The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of   65%   of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).  The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are identical.  The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on the accounts, inventory, equipment, chattel paper, documents, instruments, deposit accounts, real estate and investment property and general intangibles (other than intellectual property) related thereto (the  Revolving Facility Collateral ) rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.  The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on all other property, including capital stock, intellectual property and certain other intangible property (the  Term Loan Collateral ), rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, while the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility. 
    
  Interest and Fees:   Interest accrues on term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of Adjusted LIBOR (which has a floor of   0.75%  ) plus a margin of   3.50%   or an alternate base rate plus a margin of   2.50%  , at Products Corporation s option, and is payable quarterly, at a minimum.  Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Term Loan Facility.  
    
  Affirmative and Negative Covenants:   The 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Restricted Group s ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur liens; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) make investments; (v) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; (vi) make prepayments of contractually subordinated or junior lien debt; (vii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change their lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from their subsidiaries or restrict liens; (xi) change their fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt. The negative covenants are subject to various exceptions, including an  available amount basket  based on   50%   of Products Corporation s cumulative consolidated net income, plus a  starter  basket of   $200.0 million  , subject to Products Corporation s compliance with a   5.0   to 1.0 ratio of Products Corporation s net debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement), except such compliance is not required when such baskets are used to make investments. While the 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default, it does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. 
    
  Prepayments:   The 2016 Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments from: (i) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its restricted subsidiaries of certain additional debt; (ii) commencing with the excess cash flow calculation with respect to fiscal year ending December 31, 2017,   50%   of excess cash flow, with step-downs to   25%   and   0%   upon achievement of certain first lien leverage ratios and reduced by voluntary prepayments of loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and revolving loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent commitments thereunder are permanently reduced; and (iii) asset sale proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property that have not been reinvested to the extent in excess of certain minimum amounts. Products Corporation may voluntarily prepay the 2016 Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty unless Products Corporation prepays a term loan within six months after the Closing Date in connection with a repricing transaction (in which case a   1.00%   premium is payable).  
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company incurred approximately   $45.0 million   of fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, of which   $39.1 million   were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement using the effective interest method. The Company expensed the remaining   $5.9 million   of fees and expenses and wrote-off   $10.9 million   of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs related to the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. These amounts, totaling   $16.8 million  , were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  (ii) 2016 Revolving Credit Facility 
  Principal and Maturity:   On the Closing Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maximum availability of   $400.0 million   (with a   $100.0 million   sublimit for letters of credit and up to   $70.0 million   available for swing line loans), which availability is subject to the amount of the borrowing base.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by the greater of (x)   $50.0 million   and (y) the excess of the borrowing base over the amounts of then-effective commitments.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility permits certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies. The borrowing base calculation  
  
   20 

    REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is based on the sum of: (i)   85%   of eligible accounts receivable; (ii) the lesser of   85%   of the net orderly liquidation value and a percentage of the value specified in respect of different types of eligible inventory; (iii) qualified restricted cash (capped at   $75.0 million  ); and (iv) a temporary increase amount between August 15 and October 31 of each year, which are collectively subject to certain availability reserves set by the administrative agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the earlier of (x) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation s   5.75%   Senior Notes if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation s   5.75%   Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation s available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding   5.75%   Senior Notes by at least   $200.0 million  . 
    
  Guarantees and Security:   The Restricted Group under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement (which is the same as the Restricted Group under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement) is subject to the covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of Products Corporation (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon on a limited recourse basis.  The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of Products Corporation s restricted subsidiaries held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of   65%   of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).  The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2016 Term Loan Facility are identical.  The liens on the 2016 Revolving Facility Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank second in priority on such collateral.  The liens on the Term Loan Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank first in priority on such collateral. 
    
  Interest and Fees:   Interest is payable quarterly and accrues on borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum equal to either: (i) the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin equal to   0.25%  ,   0.50%   or   0.75%   depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time); or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin equal to   1.25%  ,   1.50%   or   1.75%   depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time), at Products Corporation s option. The applicable margin decreases as average excess availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility increases.  Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, including a commitment fee for any unused amounts of   0.25%  . Loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty. 
    
  Affirmative and Negative Covenants  : The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to those in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, other than the  available amount basket  (as described above in the description of the 2016 Term Loan Facility); provided, however, under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement the Restricted Group will be able to incur unlimited additional junior secured debt and unsecured debt, make unlimited asset sales and dispositions, make unlimited investments and acquisitions, prepay junior debt and make unlimited restricted payments to the extent that certain  payment conditions  for asset-based credit facilities are satisfied.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default. If Products Corporation s  Liquidity Amount  (defined in the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the Borrowing Base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) falls below the greater of   $35.0 million   and   10%   of the maximum availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (a  Liquidity Event Period ), then the Restricted Group will be required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of Products Corporation s EBITDA minus capital expenditures to cash interest expense for such period) of a minimum of   1.0   to 1.0 until the first date after   20   consecutive business days for which the Liquidity Amount is equal to or greater than such threshold. If Products Corporation is in default under the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by issuing certain equity securities to, or receiving capital contributions from Revlon and applying such cash, which is deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this cure right no more than   two   times in any four-quarter period, and no more than   five   times in total during the term of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  Prepayments:   Products Corporation must prepay borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent that outstanding loans and letters of credit exceed availability.  During a Liquidity Event Period, the administrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Copies of the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement and other ancillary agreements governing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the related security and collateral agreements are filed as Exhibits 10.4, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.  The above descriptions of the terms of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the related security and collateral agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements.

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company incurred approximately   $5.7 million   of fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, of which   $5.6 million   were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility using the effective interest method. The Company expensed the remaining   $0.1 million   of fees and expenses, which were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  (iii)   6.25%   Senior Notes 
  On August 4, 2016, Revlon Escrow Corporation (the  Escrow Issuer ), which on such date was a wholly owned subsidiary of Products Corporation, completed its offering (the  Offering ), pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the  Securities Act ), of   $450.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2024.  The   6.25%   Senior Notes are unsecured and were initially issued by the Escrow Issuer to the initial purchasers under an Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2016 (the    6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture ), between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the  Trustee ). The   6.25%   Senior Notes mature on August 1, 2024. Interest on the   6.25%   Senior Notes accrues at   6.25%   per annum, paid every   six months   through maturity on each February 1 and August 1, beginning on February 1, 2017. As described above, the   6.25%   Senior Notes were released from Escrow on the September 7, 2016 Acquisition Date.  On the Acquisition Date, the Escrow Issuer was merged with and into Products Corporation and in connection with the Escrow Release, Products Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Guarantors ), and the Trustee entered into a supplemental indenture (the  Supplemental Indenture ) to the   6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture, pursuant to which Products Corporation assumed the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the   6.25%   Senior Notes and the   6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture and the Guarantors jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the   6.25%   Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis.  The Guarantors are the same entities that are subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  Ranking:   The   6.25%   Senior Notes are Products Corporation s senior, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations, ranking: (i) pari passu in right of payment with all of Products Corporation s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of Products Corporation s and the Guarantors  future subordinated indebtedness; and (iii) effectively junior to all of Products Corporation s and the Guarantors  existing and future senior secured indebtedness, including, indebtedness under Products Corporation s new Senior Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The   6.25%   Senior Notes and the Guarantees are: (i) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of the Company s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the   6.25%   Senior Notes; and (ii) pari passu in right of payment with liabilities of the Guarantors other than expressly subordinated indebtedness. 
    
  Optional Redemption:   Prior to August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the   6.25%   Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, upon Products Corporation s payment of an applicable make-whole premium based on the comparable treasury rate plus   50   basis points. Prior to August 1, 2019, up to   40%   of the aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   Senior Notes that have been issued may also be redeemed at Products Corporation s option at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to   106.250%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption with the proceeds of certain equity offerings and capital contributions (so long as at least   60%   of the   6.25%   Senior Notes that have been issued thereafter remain outstanding). On and after August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the   6.25%   Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to (but not including) the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on August 1 of the years indicated below: 

All redemptions (and notices thereof) may be subject to various conditions precedent, and redemption dates specified in such notices may be extended so that such conditions precedent may be fulfilled (to the extent redemption on such dates is otherwise permitted by the   6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture).

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

Change of Control:   Upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the   6.25%   Senior Notes at a purchase price of   101%   of the outstanding principal amount of the   6.25%   Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase. 
    
  Certain Covenants:   The   6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture imposes certain limitations on Products Corporation s and the Guarantors  ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends, make certain investments and make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the   6.25%   Senior Notes and make other  restricted payments  (iii) create liens on their assets to secure debt; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company; (vi) transfer and sell assets; and (vii) permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries.  
    
  These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The   6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default. In addition, if during any period of time the   6.25%   Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard   Poor s and Moody s Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the   6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants regarding limitations on debt, limitations on restricted payments, limitation on guarantees by restricted subsidiaries, limitation on transactions with affiliates, certain provisions of the successor company covenant, limitation on asset sales and limitation on dividends from restricted subsidiaries. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company incurred approximately   $10.9 million   of fees and expenses in connection with the   6.25%   Senior Notes, of which   $10.9 million   were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the   6.25%   Senior Notes using the effective interest method.  
    
  Amended Term Loan Facility - Excess Cash Flow Payment 
  On February 29, 2016, Products Corporation prepaid   $23.2 million     of indebtedness, representing   50%   of its 2015  excess cash flow  as defined under the then existing Amended Term Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of its Amended Term Loan Facility. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by   $11.5 million   to   $651.4 million   (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The   $11.7 million   that was applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from   $6.9 million   prior to the prepayment to   $6.8 million   after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. 
  Covenants 
  Products Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the 2016 Term Loan and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility were   $1,800.0 million   and   $65.4 million  , respectively, and availability under the   $400.0 million   2016 Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base of   $300.0 million   less   $10.5 million   of outstanding undrawn letters of credit,   $16.2 million   of outstanding checks and   $65.4 million   then drawn on the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, was   $207.9 million  . 
  Products Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its   6.25%   Senior Notes Indenture as of September 30, 2016. Products Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its   5.75%   Senior Notes Indenture as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Assets and liabilities are required to be categorized into three levels of fair value based upon the assumptions used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3, if applicable, generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities are as follows: 
             
    Level 1: Fair valuing the asset or liability using observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: Fair valuing the asset or liability using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or

liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and 

Level 3: Fair valuing the asset or liability using unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions regarding the applicable asset or liability. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value are categorized in the table below:  

As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value are categorized in the table below:  

(a)   
    The fair value of the Company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts ("FX Contracts") was measured based on observable market transactions for similar transactions in actively quoted markets of spot and forward rates on the respective dates.  See Note 10,  Financial Instruments," to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.  
               (b)   
    The fair value of Products Corporation's 2013 Interest Rate Swap (as hereinafter defined) was measured based on the implied forward rates from the U.S. Dollar three-month LIBOR yield curve on the respective dates. See Note 10,  Financial Instruments.

As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair values and carrying values of the Company s long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, are categorized in the table below: 

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, is based on quoted market prices for similar issues and maturities. 
  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, notes receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings approximate their respective fair values. 

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Products Corporation maintains standby and trade letters of credit for various corporate purposes under which Products Corporation is obligated, of which   $10.5 million   and   $8.8 million   (including amounts available under credit agreements in effect at that time) were maintained at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Included in these amounts are approximately   $7.2 million   and   $7.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, in standby letters of credit that support Products Corporation s self-insurance programs. The estimated liability under such programs is accrued by Products Corporation. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily: (i) FX Contracts, intended for the purpose of managing foreign currency exchange risk by reducing the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company s net cash flows; and (ii) interest rate hedging transactions, such as the 2013 Interest Rate Swap referred to below, intended for the purpose of managing interest rate risk associated with Products Corporation s variable rate indebtedness.  
  Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts 
  The FX Contracts are entered into primarily to hedge the anticipated net cash flows resulting from inventory purchases and intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company s foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year.   
  The U.S. Dollar notional amount of the FX Contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $122.8 million   and   $76.3 million  , respectively.  
  Interest Rate Swap Transaction  
  In November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction with a   1.00%   floor, based on a notional amount of   $400 million   in respect of indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan over a period of   three   years (the "2013 Interest Rate Swap"). In connection with entering into the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the 2013 Interest Swap was carried over to apply to a notional amount of   $400 million   in respect of indebtedness under such loan for the remaining balance of the term of such swap.  The Company designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments related to the   $400 million   notional amount under the Acquisition Term Loan over the   three  -year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap (and subsequently to the   $400 million   notional amount under  
  
   25 

    REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

the 2016 Term Loan Facility for the remaining balance of the term of such swap). Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of three-month USD LIBOR or   1.00%  , while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to   2.0709%   (which, with respect to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at   5.5709%   over the remaining balance of the   three  -year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). At September 30, 2016 the fair value of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was   $(6.3) million   and the accumulated loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss was   $3.7 million   after-tax.   
  As a result of completely refinancing the Acquisition Term Loan with the 2016 Term Loan Facility in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the critical terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap no longer match the terms of the underlying debt under the 2016 Term Loan Facility.  At the refinancing date, or September 7, 2016 (the "Dedesignation Date"), the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was determined to no longer be highly effective and the Company discontinued hedge accounting for the 2013 Interest Rate Swap.  Following the dedesignation of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, changes in fair value will be accounted for as a component of other non-operating expenses.  Accumulated deferred losses of   $6.3 million  , or   $3.9 million   after-tax, at the Dedesignation Date that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized to net income over the remaining term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap through its maturity.  See "  Quantitative Information   Derivative Financial Instruments  " below).  
  The Company expects that   $2.4 million   of the after-tax deferred net losses related to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap will be amortized into earnings over the next 12 months.  
  Credit Risk 
  Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of the derivative instruments in asset positions, which totaled   $1.4 million   and   $2.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties. Given the current credit standing of the Company's counterparties to its derivative instruments, the Company believes that the risk of loss under these derivative instruments arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties is remote.

The components of net periodic benefit (income) costs for the Company's pension and the other post-retirement benefit plans for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized net periodic benefit income of   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, compared to net periodic benefit income of   $0.3 million   and   $1.6 million   in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the lower expected return on plan assets, partially offset by lower interest cost as a result of the Company's adoption of the alternative approach to calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits (the  full yield curve  approach) which was adopted by the Company at December 31, 2015. 
  Net periodic benefit costs (income) are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as follows:  

The Company expects that it will have net periodic benefit income of approximately $  1 million   for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans for all of 2016, compared with net periodic benefit cost of $  2.0 million   in 2015.  
  During the third quarter of   2016  ,   $2.2 million   and   $0.2 million   were contributed to the Company s pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, respectively. During the first nine months of   2016  , $  5.3 million   and $  0.7 million   were contributed to the Company s pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, respectively. During 2016, the Company expects to contribute approximately   $10 million   in the aggregate to its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
  Relevant aspects of the qualified defined benefit pension plans, nonqualified pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans sponsored by Products Corporation are disclosed in Note 14, "Savings Plan, Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Revlon, Inc.'s 2015 Form 10-K. 

12. INCOME TAXES  
  The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective tax rate differs from the applicable federal statutory rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates and income in foreign jurisdictions, utilization of tax loss carryforwards, foreign earnings taxable in the U.S., non-deductible expenses and other items. The Company s tax provision changes quarterly based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, foreign, state and local income taxes, tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies. In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition and/or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior period are recognized in the quarter in which any such change occurs.

  (except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

For the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a (benefit from) provision for income taxes of   $(0.4) million   and   $24.6 million  , respectively. The   $25.0 million   decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to lower pre-tax income and the phasing of the recognition of income taxes, as well as the favorable impact of certain discrete items realized in the third quarter of 2015 that did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2016. 
  For the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of   $16.0 million   and $  53.8 million  , respectively. The $  37.8 million   decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to lower pre-tax income and the phasing of the recognition of income taxes, as well as the favorable impact of certain discrete items realized in the first nine months of 2015 that did not reoccur in the first nine months of 2016. 
  The Company's effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   differed than the federal statutory rate of   35%   as a result of non-deductible acquisition costs, certain dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S., and state and local taxes, partially offset by the foreign and U.S. effects attributable to operations outside the U.S. 
  The Company's effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was higher than the federal statutory rate of   35%   as a result of certain foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S. and state and local taxes.  
  The Company remains subject to examination of its income tax returns including, without limitation:  Australia for tax years ended December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2014; South Africa and the U.K. for tax years ended December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2014; and Canada, Spain and the U.S. (federal) for tax years ended December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2015. 
    
  Elizabeth Arden remains subject to examination of its income tax returns in various jurisdictions including, without limitation, U.S. (federal) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 through June 30, 2015.  The Internal Revenue Service (the  IRS ) has been auditing Elizabeth Arden s U.S. (federal) tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 through June 30, 2012.  In the audit, the IRS has proposed increases in Elizabeth Arden s taxable income, relating to transfer pricing, in an amount totaling approximately   $85 million  .  The Company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to continue to contest them vigorously and to pursue its available remedies.  Although any IRS examination contains an element of uncertainty, based on current facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any protest, appeals or judicial process will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

14. SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION 
  Operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Company's  Chief Executive Officer ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the Company's performance. As a result of the similarities in the procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes for the Company s products, much of the information provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and provided in the segment table below, is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Company's Chief

Executive Officer.  As of September 30, 2016, and since the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, the Elizabeth Arden organization has continued to operate and be evaluated on a stand-alone basis.  
   At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s operations are organized into the following reportable segments: 
             
    Consumer   - The Consumer segment is comprised of the Company's consumer brands other than those operated under the Elizabeth Arden segment, which primarily include   Revlon  ,   Almay  ,   SinfulColors   and   Pure Ice   in color cosmetics;   Revlon ColorSilk   in women s hair color;   Revlon   in beauty tools; and   Mitchum   in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Company s principal customers for its consumer products include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Consumer segment also includes a skincare line under the   Natural Honey   brand and a hair color line under the   Llongueras   brand sold to large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain, which were acquired as part of the Colomer Acquisition.  In October 2015 and in May 2016, the Company acquired the U.S. Cutex business and Cutex International business and related assets, respectively. The results of operations relating to the sales of   Cutex   nail care products are included within the Consumer segment.   
                
    Professional   - The Professional segment is comprised primarily of the brands which the Company acquired in the Colomer Acquisition, which include   Revlon Professional   in hair color and hair care;   CND  -branded products     in nail polishes and nail enhancements; and   American Crew   in men s grooming products, all of which are sold worldwide to professional salons. The Company s principal customers for its professional products include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally. The Professional segment also includes a multi-cultural line consisting of   Creme of Nature   hair care products sold to large volume retailers, other retailers and professional salons, primarily in the U.S.     
                
    Elizabeth Arden   - The Elizabeth Arden segment includes the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden business and related purchase accounting for the Company's September 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of prestige fragrance, skincare and cosmetic brands, including the   Elizabeth Arden   skin care brands, color cosmetics and fragrances; designer fragrances such as   Juicy Couture   and   John Varvatos  ;     heritage fragrances such as   Curve  ,   Elizabeth Taylor  ,   Britney Spears    and   Christina Aguilera  ; and various celebrity fragrances.  
                
    Other   - The Other segment primarily includes the operating results of the CBB business and related purchase accounting for the CBB Acquisition. CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories.  
             The Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impacts of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) deferred compensation related to the accounting for the CBB Acquisition; (iv) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 to inventory acquired in the Cutex International Acquisition and CBB Acquisition, respectively; (v) charges related to the Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program; and (vi) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.  Such items are shown below in the table reconciling segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses, as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales.  
  The accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1,  Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in Revlon, Inc.'s 2015 Form 10-K. The Company's assets and liabilities are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the Consolidated Financial Statements; thus, no additional information regarding assets and liabilities of the Company s reportable segments is produced for the Company's Chief Executive Officer or included in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of   September 30, 2016  , after giving effect to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the Company had operations established in   26   countries outside of the U.S. and its products are sold throughout the world. Generally, net sales by geographic area are presented by attributing revenues from external customers on the basis of where the products are sold:  

15. BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  
  Shares used in basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Shares used in diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock under the Company s Stock Plan using the treasury stock method. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were   no   outstanding stock options under the Company's Stock Plan.  
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there are   nil   and   234,712   shares, respectively, of unvested restricted stock that could potentially dilute basic earnings per common share in the future that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share, as there effect would be anti-dilutive.   No   unvested restricted stock awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

16. CONTINGENCIES  
  The Company is involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company s operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company s income for that particular period. 
    
  As previously disclosed, following the announcement of the execution of the Elizabeth Arden Merger Agreement, several putative shareholder class action lawsuits and a derivative lawsuit were filed challenging the Merger. In addition to the complaints filed on behalf of plaintiffs Parker, Christiansen, Ross and Stein, on July 25, 2016, a lawsuit (Hutson v. Elizabeth Arden, Inc., et al., Case No. CACE-16-013566) (referred to as the  Hutson complaint ) was filed in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida (the  Court ) against Elizabeth Arden, the members of the board of directors of Elizabeth Arden, Revlon, Products Corporation and Acquisition Sub. In general, the Hutson complaint alleges that: (i) the members of Elizabeth Arden s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Elizabeth Arden s shareholders with respect to the Merger, by, among other things, approving the Merger pursuant to an unfair process and at an inadequate and unfair price; and (ii) Revlon, Products Corporation and Acquisition Sub aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by the members of Elizabeth Arden s board. The plaintiff seeks relief similar to that sought in the Parker case. 
  By Order dated August 4, 2016, all   five   cases were consolidated by the Court into a Consolidated Amended Class Action.  Thereafter, on August 11, 2016 a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint was filed, seeking to enjoin defendants from consummating the Merger and/or from soliciting shareholder votes. To the extent that the Merger was consummated, the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint seeks to rescind the Merger or recover rescissory or other compensatory damages, along with costs and fees. The grounds for relief set forth in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in large part track those grounds as asserted in the   five   individual complaints, as previously disclosed. Class counsel advised that post consummation

  (except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

of the Merger they were going to file a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, but to date no such complaint has been filed. 
  The Company believes the allegations contained in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Elizabeth Arden Merger Agreement or the Merger may be filed in the future. 
  The Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company s operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company s income for that particular period. 

17. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS     
  Reimbursement Agreements 
  As previously disclosed in the Revlon, Inc.'s 2015 Form 10-K, Revlon, Products Corporation and MacAndrews   Forbes have entered into reimbursement agreements (the "Reimbursement Agreements") pursuant to which: (i) MacAndrews   Forbes is obligated to provide (directly or through its affiliates) certain professional and administrative services, including, without limitation, employees, to the Company, and to purchase services from third party providers, such as insurance, legal, accounting and air transportation services, on behalf of the Company, to the extent requested by Products Corporation; and (ii) Products Corporation is obligated to provide certain professional and administrative services, including, without limitation, employees, to MacAndrews   Forbes and to purchase services from third party providers, such as insurance, legal and accounting services, on behalf of MacAndrews   Forbes, to the extent requested by MacAndrews   Forbes, provided that in each case the performance of such services does not cause an unreasonable burden to MacAndrews   Forbes or Products Corporation, as the case may be. 
  The Company reimburses MacAndrews   Forbes for the allocable costs of the services that MacAndrews   Forbes purchases for or provides to the Company and for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that MacAndrews   Forbes incurs in connection with the provision of such services. MacAndrews   Forbes reimburses Products Corporation for the allocable costs of the services that Products Corporation purchases for or provides to MacAndrews   Forbes and for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Products Corporation in connection with the purchase or provision of such services. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and MacAndrews   Forbes, on the other, has agreed to indemnify the other party for losses arising out of the services provided by it under the Reimbursement Agreements, other than losses resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence.  
  The Reimbursement Agreements may be terminated by either party on   90   days' notice. The Company does not intend to request services under the Reimbursement Agreements unless their costs would be at least as favorable to the Company as could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.  
  The Company participates in MacAndrews   Forbes' directors and officers liability insurance program (the  D O Insurance Program ), as well as its other insurance coverages, such as property damage, business interruption, liability and other coverages, which cover the Company, as well as MacAndrews   Forbes and its subsidiaries. The limits of coverage for certain of the policies are available on an aggregate basis for losses to any or all of the participating companies and their respective directors and officers.  The Company reimburses MacAndrews   Forbes from time to time for their allocable portion of the premiums for such coverage or the Company pays the insurers directly, which premiums the Company believes are more favorable than the premiums that the Company would pay were it to secure stand-alone coverage. Any amounts paid by the Company directly to MacAndrews   Forbes in respect of premiums are included in the amounts paid under the Reimbursement Agreements.  
  The net activity related to services provided and/or (purchased) under the Reimbursement Agreements during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.3 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, which primarily includes partial payments made by the Company to MacAndrews   Forbes during the first quarter of   2016   and   2015   for premiums related to the Company's allocable portion of the   5  -year renewal of the D O Insurance Program for the period from   January 31, 2012 through January 31, 2017  . As of each   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a receivable balance of   $0.1 million  , respectively, from MacAndrews   Forbes was included in the Company's Balance Sheets for transactions subject to the Reimbursement Agreements.

Other 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company engaged several companies in which MacAndrews   Forbes had a controlling interest to provide the Company with various ordinary course business services. These services included processing approximately   $35.1 million   and   $25.4 million   of coupon redemptions for the Company's retail customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for which the Company paid fees of approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.3 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and other similar advertising, coupon redemption and raw material supply services, for which the Company paid fees aggregating to less than   $0.3 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company believes that its engagement of each of these affiliates was on arm's length terms, taking into account each firm's expertise in its respective field, and that the fees paid were at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated parties.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
  Overview of the Business       
  Revlon, Inc. ("Revlon" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") conducts its business exclusively through its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation ("Products Corporation"), and its subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden, Inc. ( Elizabeth Arden ). Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews   Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, "MacAndrews   Forbes"), a corporation wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman. 
  The Company operates in   four   reporting segments: the consumer division ( Consumer  the professional division ( Professional  Elizabeth Arden; and Other (each as described below). The Company manufactures, markets and sells worldwide an extensive array of beauty and personal care products, including color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, beauty tools, men's grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants, fragrances, skincare and other beauty care products. The Company s principal customers for its products in the Consumer segment include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Company's principal customers for its products in the Professional segment include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally.   
  On September 7, 2016 (the "Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of Elizabeth Arden (the  Elizabeth Arden Acquisition ).  Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of brands that are highly complementary to the Company's existing brand portfolio and are sold worldwide.  In North America, Elizabeth Arden s principal customers include prestige retailers, the mass retail channel and distributors, as well as direct sales to consumers via its branded retail outlet stores and e-commerce business.  Elizabeth Arden products are also sold through the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas.  Internationally, Elizabeth Arden s portfolio of owned and licensed brands is sold to perfumeries, boutiques, department stores, travel retailers and distributors.  The operating results and purchase accounting  for the Company's Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are presented in the Elizabeth Arden segment.    
  With the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the Company expects to benefit from greater scale, an expanded global footprint, and with the addition of Elizabeth Arden s growing prestige fragrances, skin care and color cosmetics, a significant presence across all major beauty channels and categories.  The combination will leverage the Company s scale across major vendors and manufacturing partners, improving distribution and procurement efficiencies.  Upon closing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition the Company disclosed that it expected to achieve approximately $140 million of synergies and cost reductions over a multi-year period through the elimination of duplicative activities, leveraging purchasing scale, and optimizing the manufacturing and distribution networks of the combined company.  The Company anticipates achieving these expected synergies and cost reductions.  Other expected strategic benefits from the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition include: 
             
    Expanded Category Mix:   The Company s strength and expertise in color cosmetics, hair care, men s grooming, anti-perspirants, deodorants and beauty tools are complemented by the addition of Elizabeth Arden s world-class portfolio of licensed prestige fragrances and the internationally recognized line of Elizabeth Arden-branded prestige fragrance, skin care and color cosmetics products, which are highly profitable categories that the Company believes are key to future industry growth; 
                
    Channel Diversification:   Elizabeth Arden s strong global reach in prestige distribution and travel retail complement Revlon s strength in mass and salons, strongly positioning the combined company in all key beauty channels; and 
                
    Broader Geographic Footprint:   Post-acquisition the combined company now markets and distributes its products in approximately 150 countries. With Elizabeth Arden s presence in important international growth regions, including Asia Pacific, the combined company will be better positioned to compete globally. 
       
  The operating results and purchase accounting for the Company's Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are presented in the Elizabeth Arden reporting segment.  Refer to Note 2, "Business Combinations," to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further details related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. 
  The Other segment primarily includes the operating results of the CBBeauty Group and certain of its related entities, which the Company acquired in April 2015 (collectively "CBB" and such transaction, the "CBB Acquisition").  CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under a variety of celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories.

The Company's Business Strategy  
      Our strategy is built on three key pillars: 
             
    Build a Foundation for Sustainable Growth that Outpaces the Industry  .

The XFX increase in consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by a   $5.1 million  , or   4.5%  , increase in Professional segment net sales and the inclusion of $135.2 million of net sales as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition from and after the September 7, 2016 Acquisition Date.

The   $12.4 million   decrease in the third quarter of   2016   was primarily due to: 
             
    $41.6 million   of higher selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses, primarily driven by the inclusion of the SG A expenses as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, commencing on and after the Acquisition Date;

    a   $5.9 million   increase in interest expense during the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the debt related transactions completed in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, as discussed in Recent Events below; 
     with the foregoing partially offset by:

a   $25.0 million   decrease in the provision for income taxes recognized in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to lower pretax income, the phasing of the recognition of income taxes and the relatively favorable impact of certain discrete items that did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2016.

The   $16.2 million   decrease in consolidated income from continuing operations, net of taxes in the first nine months of   2016   was primarily due to:

     with the foregoing partially offset by: 
             
    $43.5 million   of higher gross profit in the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of gross profit as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, commencing on and after the Acquisition Date, partially offset by lower gross profit within the Consumer segment; and 
                
    a $37.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes recognized in the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to lower pretax income, the phasing of the recognition of income taxes and the relatively favorable impact of certain discrete items that did not reoccur in the first nine months of 2016.

The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by   $11.5 million   to   $651.4 million   (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The   $11.7 million   that was applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from   $6.9 million   prior to the prepayment to   $6.8 million   after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.

  Segment Results: 
  The Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impact of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) deferred compensation related to the accounting for the CBB Acquisition; (iv) costs of sales resulting from  fair value adjustments in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 related to inventory acquired in the Cutex International Acquisition and the CBB Acquisition, respectively; (v) charges related to the Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program; and (vi) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. For a reconciliation of segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 14, "Segment Data and Related Information" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

  Consumer Segment 
  Third quarter results: 
  Consumer segment net sales in the third quarter of   2016   were   $342.8 million  , a   $5.3 million   decrease, or   1.5%  , compared to   $348.1 million   in the third quarter of   2015  . Excluding the   $5.8 million   unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales increased on an XFX basis by   $0.5 million  , or   0.1%  , in the third quarter of   2016  , compared to the third quarter of   2015  . This increase was primarily driven by   i  ncremental net sales from completing the global consolidation of the Cutex brand, as well as higher net sales of   Revlon   beauty tools and   Revlon   color cosmetics, mostly offset by lower net sales of   SinfulColors   color cosmetics.  
  Consumer segment profit in the third quarter of   2016   was   $81.0 million  , a   $5.0 million   decrease, or   5.8%  , compared to   $86.0 million   in the third quarter of   2015  , primarily resulting from the absence in 2016 of a gain related to the sale of a non-core consumer brand that was completed in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of FX transaction within cost of sales, partially offset by a decrease in brand support on lower performing brands. 
  Year-to-date results: 
  Consumer segment net sales in the first nine months of   2016   were   $1,022.3 million  , a   $4.8 million   decrease, or   0.5%  , compared to   $1,027.1 million   in the first nine months of   2015  . Excluding the   $27.4 million   unfavorable FX impact, total Consumer net sales increased on an XFX basis by   $22.6 million  , or   2.2%  , in the first nine months of   2016  , compared to the first nine months of   2015  . This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales of   Cutex   nail products,   Mitchum   anti-perspirant deodorant products,   Revlon   beauty tools and   Revlon   color cosmetics, partially offset by lower net sales of   Almay   color cosmetics.

Consumer segment profit in the first nine months of   2016   was   $220.4 million  , a   $11.6 million   decrease, or   5.0%  , compared to   $232.0 million   in the first nine months of   2015  .

This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit as a result of higher promotional allowances,   t  he unfavorable impact of product mix and the impact of foreign currency transaction within cost of sales, partially offset by a decrease in brand support on lower performing brands. 
    
  Professional Segment 
  Third quarter results: 
  Professional segment net sales in the third quarter of   2016   were   $118.8 million  , a   $4.3 million   increase, or   3.8%  , compared to   $114.5 million   in the third quarter of   2015  . Excluding the   $0.8 million   unfavorable FX impact, total Professional net sales increased on an XFX basis by   $5.1 million   in the third quarter of   2016  , compared to the third quarter of   2015  . This increase was primarily due to     higher net sales of   Revlon Professional   hair products, in part as a result of the launch of   Revlon Professional     Be Fabulous     and   American Crew   men s grooming products throughout most territories, partially offset by lower net sales of   CND   nail products. 
  Professional segment profit in the third quarter of   2016   was   $23.7 million  , a   $0.3 million   increase, or   1.3%  , compared to   $23.4 million   in the third quarter of   2015  , primarily driven by higher net sales internationally, partially offset by higher brand support in the third quarter of 2016.  
  Year-to-date results: 
  Professional segment net sales in the first nine months of   2016   were   $357.2 million  , a   $5.1 million   increase, or   1.4%  , compared to   $352.1 million   in the first nine months of   2015  . Excluding the   $3.8 million   unfavorable FX impact, total Professional net sales increased on an XFX basis by   $8.9 million   in the first nine months of   2016  , compared to the first nine months of   2015  . This increase was primarily as a result of higher net sales of   Revlon Professional   hair products and   American Crew   men s grooming products, partially offset by lower net sales of   CND   nail products within the International and North America regions. 
  Professional segment profit in the first nine months of   2016   was   $73.4 million  , a   $3.5 million   decrease, or   4.6%  , compared to   $76.9 million   in the first nine months of   2015  , primarily driven by higher net sales internationally, partially offset by higher brand support in the first nine months of 2016.  
    
  Elizabeth Arden Segment  
  Third quarter and Year-to-date results: 
  The Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition which closed on the September 7, 2016 Acquisition Date. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 is not included in this Form 10-Q, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment. 
  Elizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality. 
    
  Other Segment 
  Third quarter results: 
  Other segment net sales in the third quarter of   2016   were   $8.0 million  , a   $0.9 million   decrease, or   10.1%  , compared to   $8.9 million   in the third quarter of   2015  . Excluding the   $1.5 million   unfavorable FX impact, total Other segment net sales increased on an XFX basis by   $0.6 million  , or   6.7%  , in the third quarter of   2016  , primarily due to net sales associated with newly-acquired distribution rights in Europe.

Other segment loss in the third quarter of   2016   was   $0.1 million  , a   $1.3 million   decrease, or   92.9%  , compared to   $1.4 million   in the third quarter of   2015  .  The decrease in Other segment loss was primarily driven by higher net sales and lower brand support. 
  Year-to-date results: 
  Other segment net sales in the first nine months of   2016   were   $18.6 million  , a   $5.4 million   increase, or   40.9%  , compared to   $13.2 million   in the first nine months of   2015  . Excluding the   $1.8 million   unfavorable FX impact, total Other segment net sales increased on an XFX basis by   $7.2 million  , or   54.5%  , in the first nine months of   2016  , compared to the first nine months of   2015  . This increase was primarily driven by there being no comparable results for the first nine months of 2015, as the CBB Acquisition closed on April 21, 2015. 
  Other segment loss in the first nine months of   2016   was   $0.9 million  , a   $0.3 million   decrease, or   25.0%  , compared to   $1.2 million   in the first nine months of   2015  .  This decrease was primarily driven by there being no comparable results for the first nine months of 2015, as the CBB Acquisition closed on April 21, 2015, and higher net sales. 
    
  Geographic Results:  
  In connection with changes that the organization made to its management reporting structure following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Company has combined its former U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico operating regions into the North America region for reporting purposes. The Company has modified its net sales discussion to conform to management's procedures for reviewing the business, and, accordingly, the amounts for the third quarter of 2015 and for the first nine months of 2015 have been restated to conform to this presentation.

Consumer Segment 
  Third quarter results: 
  North America 
  In the Consumer segment, North America net sales in the third quarter of   2016   decreased by   $11.7 million  , or   5.3%  , to   $210.8 million  , as compared to   $222.5 million   in the third quarter of   2015  . This decrease was primarily driven by softening market conditions in core categories that impacted   Revlon   color cosmetics and   SinfulColors   color cosmetics. These decreases were partially offset by incremental net sales as a result of completing the global consolidation of the   Cutex   brand, as well as higher net sales of   Revlon   beauty tools.

  Elizabeth Arden Segment  
  Third quarter and Year-to-date results: 
  The Elizabeth Arden segment is comprised of the operations acquired by the Company in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition which closed on the September 7, 2016 Acquisition Date. Therefore, an analysis of net sales and segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 is not included in this Form 10-Q, as the Company does not have any comparable prior year's net sales or segment profit for the Elizabeth Arden segment.  
  Elizabeth Arden operations have historically been seasonal, with higher net sales generally occurring in the second half of the year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season. As a result, the operating results of the Elizabeth Arden segment following the Acquisition Date include the effects of seasonality.

  SG A expenses:  

SG A expenses increased by   $41.6 million   in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily driven by: 
             
    the inclusion of SG A expenses in the Elizabeth Arden segment as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, commencing on and after the Acquisition Date, which contributed   $36.6 million   to the increase in SG A expenses; and

    $21.0 million of higher general and administrative expenses in 2016, primarily due to higher compensation due to changes in senior executive management, higher professional and legal fees and a total of $6.5 million in gains recognized in the first nine months of 2015 related to the sales of certain non-core assets, partially offset by lower severance;  
     with the foregoing partially offset by:

  The Company incurred   $39.5 million   of acquisition and integration costs in the first nine months of   2016  , primarily related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.  In the first nine months of 2015, the Company incurred   $6.5 million   of acquisition and integration costs primarily related to non-restructuring integration costs related to the Company's integration of Colomer's operations into the Company's business. 
    
  Restructuring charges and other, net:  

The Company recognized   $0.5 million   of restructuring charges and other, net, during the third quarter of 2016, primarily related to charges for employee-related costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program, as compared to   $4.0 million   of estimated restructuring costs recognized during the third quarter of 2015, which primarily related to charges for employee-related costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program. 
  The Company recognized   $2.3 million   of restructuring charges and other, net, for the first nine months of   2016  , primarily related to charges for employee-related costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program, as compared to   $0.9 million   of estimated restructuring costs recognized during the first nine months of 2015, which primarily related to charges for employee-related costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program, offset by certain reductions in estimated restructuring costs. 
  The Company expects to achieve approximately   $9 million   in cost reductions during 2016 from the 2015 Efficiency Program and annualized cost reductions thereafter are expected to be approximately $10 million to $15 million. 
         See Note 3, "Restructuring Charges" to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
    
  Interest expense: 

The   $5.9 million   and   $7.3 million   increase in interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of   2016  , compared to the third quarter and first nine months of   2015  , respectively, was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and higher weighted average borrowing rates as a result of the debt transactions completed in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.

  Foreign currency (gains) losses, net:  

The Company recognized   $1.2 million   of foreign currency losses, net, during the third quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $0.7 million   of foreign currency gains, net, during the third quarter of   2015  , primarily driven by the net unfavorable impact of the revaluation of certain U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany payables and foreign currency denominated receivables during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to net gains primarily driven by the Company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts during the third quarter of 2015. 
  The   $1.0 million   decrease in foreign currency losses, net, during the first nine months of   2016  , as compared to the first nine months of   2015  , was primarily driven by the net favorable impact of the revaluation of certain U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany payables and foreign currency denominated receivables, offset in part by the unfavorable impact of losses on the Company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to gains on the Company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts during the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  Provision for income taxes: 

The provision for income taxes decreased by   $25.0 million   in the third quarter of   2016  , compared to the third quarter of   2015  , primarily due to lower pre-tax income and the phasing of the recognition of income taxes, as well as the favorable impact of certain discrete items realized in the third quarter of 2015 that did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2016. 
  The provision for income taxes decreased by   $37.8 million   in the first nine months of   2016  , compared to the first nine months of   2015  , primarily due to lower pre-tax income and the phasing of the recognition of income taxes, as well as the favorable impact of certain discrete items realized in the first nine months of 2015 that did not reoccur in the first nine months of 2016. 
  The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 differed than the 35% federal statutory rate as a result of non-deductible acquisition costs, certain dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S., and state and local taxes, partially offset by the foreign and U.S. effects attributable to operations outside the U.S. 
  The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was higher than the 35% federal statutory rate as a result of certain foreign dividends and earnings taxable in the U.S. and state and local taxes. 
  The Company expects that its tax provision and effective tax rate in any individual quarter and year-to-date period will vary and may not be indicative of the Company's tax provision and effective tax rate for the full year. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a liquidity position of   $307.2 million  , consisting of   $99.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents, as well as   $207.9 million     in available borrowings under Products Corporation's $400.0 million 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the borrowing base of   $300.0 million  , less   $10.5 million   of outstanding undrawn letters of credit,   $16.2 million   of outstanding checks and   $65.4 million   of borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility at such date.  
  The Company s foreign operations held   $97.0 million   out of the total   $99.2 million   in cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) as of   September 30, 2016  .  The cash held by the Company s foreign operations is primarily used to fund such operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources of cash to fund these needs. As part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings, if any, that it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs, including for the Company s debt service obligations, and pays applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, if any, on such earnings to the extent repatriated, and otherwise records a tax liability for the estimated cost of repatriation in a future period.  The Company believes that the cash generated by its domestic operations and availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit should be sufficient to meet its domestic liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, the Company currently anticipates that restrictions and/or taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings will not have a material effect on the Company s liquidity during such period.  
    
  Changes in Cash Flows    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of   $99.2 million  , compared with   $326.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The following table summarizes the Company s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Operating Activities  
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $70.8 million   and $  2.6 million   for the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase in cash used in operating activities in the first nine months of   2016  , compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily driven by the timing of certain accounts payable disbursements at the end of 2015, cash used in operating activities related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and related cash used for acquisition and integration costs. 
    
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $1,061.3 million   and $  55.4 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  , respectively, which included   $33.1 million   and   $27.0 million   of cash used for capital expenditures, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2016 included $1,034.3 in cash payments for the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition (partially offset by $41.1 million of cash acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition) and $29.1 million in cash payments for the May 2016 Cutex International Acquisition, as compared to $34.2 million in cash payments, net of cash acquired, primarily for the Company's April 2015 CBB Acquisition.

    $3.4 million of scheduled amortization payments on the Acquisition Term Loan;

    a $24.6 million required excess cash flow prepayment made under the Amended Term Loan Facility; and 
                
    $5.1 million of scheduled amortization payments on the Acquisition Term Loan; 
     with the foregoing partially offset by: 
             
    $4.3 million of short-term borrowings and overdraft.

  Principal and Maturity:   On the Acquisition Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative and collateral agent and which has an initial aggregate principal amount of $1,800.0 million and will mature on the earlier of (x) the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation s 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  5.75% Senior Notes ) if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation s available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes by at least $200.0 million.  The loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility were borrowed at an original issue discount of 0.5% to their principal amount. The 2016 Term Loan Facility may be increased by an amount equal to the sum of (x) the greater of $450.0 million and 90% of Products Corporation s pro forma consolidated EBITDA, plus (y) an unlimited amount to the extent that (1) the first lien leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation s net senior secured funded debt that is not junior or subordinated to the liens of the Senior Facilities to EBITDA) is less than or equal to 3.5 to 1.0 (for debt secured pari passu with the 2016 Term Loan Facility) or (2) the secured leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation s net senior secured funded debt to EBITDA) is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.0 (for junior lien or unsecured debt), plus (z) up to an additional $400.0 million if the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has been repaid and terminated. 
    
  Guarantees and Security:   Products Corporation and the restricted subsidiaries under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which include Products Corporation s domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and its domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the  Restricted Group ), are subject to the covenants under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement.  The 2016 Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by each existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of Products Corporation (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon, on a limited recourse basis.  The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).  The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are identical.  The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on the accounts, inventory, equipment, chattel paper, documents, instruments, deposit accounts, real estate and investment property and general intangibles (other than intellectual property) related thereto (the  Revolving Facility Collateral ) rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.  The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on all other property, including capital stock, intellectual property and certain other intangible property (the  Term Loan Collateral ), rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, while the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility. 
    
  Interest and Fees:   Interest accrues on term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of Adjusted LIBOR (which has a floor of 0.75%) plus a margin of 3.50% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 2.50%, at Products Corporation s option, and is payable quarterly, at a minimum.  Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Term Loan Facility.  
    
  Affirmative and Negative Covenants:   The 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Restricted Group s ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur liens; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) make investments; (v) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; (vi) make prepayments of contractually subordinated or junior lien debt; (vii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change their lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from their subsidiaries or restrict liens; (xi) change their fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt. The negative covenants are subject to various exceptions, including an  available amount basket  based on 50% of Products Corporation s cumulative consolidated net income, plus a  starter  basket of $200.0 million, subject to Products Corporation s compliance with a 5.0 to 1.0 ratio of Products Corporation s net debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement), except such compliance is not required when such baskets are used to make investments. While the 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default, it does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. 
    
  Prepayments:   The 2016 Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments from: (i) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its restricted subsidiaries of certain additional debt; (ii) commencing with the excess cash flow calculation with respect to fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, 50% of excess cash flow, with step-downs to 25% and 0% upon achievement of certain first lien leverage ratios and reduced by voluntary prepayments of loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and revolving loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent commitments thereunder are permanently reduced; and (iii) asset sale proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property that have not been reinvested to the extent in excess of certain minimum amounts. Products Corporation may voluntarily prepay the 2016 Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty unless Products Corporation prepays a term loan within six months after the Closing Date in connection with a repricing transaction (in which case a 1.00% premium is payable). 
  2016 Revolving Credit Facility 
  Principal and Maturity:   On the Closing Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative agent and collateral  agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maximum availability of $400.0 million (with a $100.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and up to $70.0 million available for swing line loans), which availability is subject to the amount of the borrowing base.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by the greater of (x) $50.0 million and (y) the excess of the borrowing base over the amounts of then-effective commitments.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility permits certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies. The borrowing base calculation under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is based on the sum of: (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable; (ii) the lesser of 85% of the net orderly liquidation value and a percentage of the value specified in respect of different types of eligible inventory; (iii) qualified restricted cash (capped at $75.0 million); and (iv) a temporary increase amount between August 15 and October 31 of each year, which are collectively subject to certain availability reserves set by the administrative agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the earlier of (x) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation s 5.75% Senior Notes if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation s 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation s available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes by at least $200.0 million. 
    
  Guarantees and Security:   The Restricted Group under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement (which is the same as the Restricted Group under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement) is subject to the covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of Products Corporation (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon on a limited recourse basis.  The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of Products Corporation s restricted subsidiaries held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).  The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2016 Term Loan Facility are identical.  The liens on the 2016 Revolving Facility Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank second in priority on such collateral.  The liens on the Term Loan Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank first in priority on such collateral. 
    
  Interest and Fees:   Interest is payable quarterly and accrues on borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum equal to either: (i) the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75% depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time); or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin equal to 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75% depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time), at Products Corporation s option. The applicable margin decreases as average excess availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility increases.  Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, including a commitment fee for any unused amounts of 0.25%. Loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty. 
    
  Affirmative and Negative Covenants  : The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to those in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, other than the  available amount basket  (as described above in the description of the 2016 Term Loan Facility); provided, however, under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement the Restricted Group will be able to incur unlimited additional junior secured debt and unsecured debt, make unlimited asset sales and dispositions, make unlimited investments and acquisitions, prepay junior debt and make unlimited restricted payments to the extent that certain  payment conditions  for asset-based credit facilities are satisfied.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default. If Products Corporation s  Liquidity Amount  (defined in the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the Borrowing Base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) falls below the greater of $35.0 million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (a  Liquidity Event Period ), then the Restricted Group will be required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of Products Corporation s EBITDA minus capital expenditures to cash interest expense for such period) of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 until the first date after 20 consecutive business days for which the Liquidity Amount is equal to or greater than such threshold. If Products Corporation is in default under the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by issuing certain equity securities to, or receiving capital contributions from, the Company and applying such cash which is deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this cure right no more than two times in any four-quarter period, and no more than five times in total during the term of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  Prepayments:   Products Corporation must prepay borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent that outstanding loans and letters of credit exceed availability.  During a Liquidity Event Period, the administrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Copies of the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement and other ancillary agreements governing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the related security and collateral agreements are filed as Exhibits 10.4, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.  The above descriptions of the terms of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the related security and collateral agreements are qualified in their entirety by references to such agreements. 
  6.25% Senior Notes 
  On August 4, 2016, Revlon Escrow Corporation (the  Escrow Issuer ), which on such date was a wholly owned subsidiary of Products Corporation, completed its offering (the  Offering ), pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the  Securities Act ), of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024.  The 6.25% Senior Notes are unsecured and were issued by the Escrow Issuer to the initial purchasers under an Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2016 (the  6.25% Senior Notes Indenture ), between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the  Trustee ). The 6.25% Senior Notes mature on August 1, 2024. Interest on the 6.25% Senior Notes accrues at 6.25% per annum, paid every six months through maturity on each February 1 and August 1, beginning on February 1, 2017. As described above, the 6.25% Senior Notes were released from Escrow on the September 7, 2016 Acquisition Date.  On the Acquisition Date, the Escrow Issuer was merged with and into Products Corporation and in connection with the Escrow Release, Products Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Guarantors ), and the Trustee entered into a supplemental indenture (the  Supplemental Indenture ) to the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, pursuant to which Products Corporation assumed the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the 6.25% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture and the Guarantors jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 6.25% Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis.  The Guarantors are the same entities that are subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. 

Ranking:   The 6.25% Senior Notes are Products Corporation s senior, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations, ranking: (i) pari passu in right of payment with all of Products Corporation s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of Products Corporation s and the Guarantors  future subordinated indebtedness; and (iii) effectively junior to all of Products Corporation s and the Guarantors  existing and future senior secured indebtedness, including, indebtedness under Products Corporation s new Senior Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 6.25% Senior Notes and the Guarantees are: (i) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of the Company s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 6.25% Senior Notes; and (ii) pari passu in right of payment with liabilities of the Guarantors other than expressly subordinated indebtedness. 
    
  Optional Redemption:   Prior to August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the 6.25% Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, upon Products Corporation s payment of an applicable make-whole premium based on the comparable treasury rate plus 50 basis points. Prior to August 1, 2019, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes that have been issued may also be redeemed at Products Corporation s option at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption with the proceeds of certain equity offerings and capital contributions (so long as at least 60% of the 6.25% Senior Notes that have been issued thereafter remain outstanding). On and after August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the 6.25% Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to (but not including) the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on August 1 of the years indicated below: 

All redemptions (and notices thereof) may be subject to various conditions precedent, and redemption dates specified in such notices may be extended so that such conditions precedent may be fulfilled (to the extent redemption on such dates is otherwise permitted by the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture). 
    
  Change of Control:   Upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 6.25% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 6.25% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase. 
    
  Certain Covenants:   The 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture imposes certain limitations on Products Corporation s and the Guarantors  ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends, make certain investments and make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 6.25% Senior Notes and make other  restricted payments;  (iii) create liens on their assets to secure debt; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company; (vi) transfer and sell assets; and (vii) permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries. 
    
  These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default. In addition, if during any period of time the 6.25% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard   Poor s and Moody s Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants regarding limitations on debt, limitations on restricted payments, limitation on guarantees by restricted subsidiaries, limitation on transactions with affiliates, certain provisions of the successor company covenant, limitation on asset sales and limitation on dividends from restricted subsidiaries. 
  Amended Term Loan Facility - Excess Cash Flow Payment 
  On February 29, 2016, Products Corporation prepaid   $23.2 million     of indebtedness, representing   50%   of its 2015  excess cash flow  as defined under the then existing Amended Term Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of its Amended Term Loan Facility. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by   $11.5 million   to   $651.4 million   (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The   $11.7 million   that was applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from   $6.9 million   prior to the prepayment to   $6.8 million   after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. 
  (b)   Covenants 
  Products Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement and the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility were   $1,800.0 million   and   $65.4 million  , respectively, and availability under the   $400.0 million   2016 Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base of   $300.0 million  , less   $10.5 million   of outstanding undrawn letters of credit,   $16.2 million   of outstanding checks, and   $65.4 million   then drawn on the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, was   $207.9 million  . 
  Products Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture as of September 30, 2016. Products Corporation was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
    
  Sources and Uses  
  The Company s principal sources of funds are expected to be operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit. The 2016 Term Loan Agreement, 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture and the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture contain certain provisions that by their terms limit Products Corporation's and its subsidiaries  ability to, among other things, incur additional debt.  
  The Company s principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses, including expenses in connection with the continued execution of the Company s business strategy; payments in connection with the Company's synergy and integration programs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company s restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; severance not otherwise included in the Company s restructuring programs; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories. The Company s cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans in the first nine months of   2016   were   $6.0 million  .  The Company expects cash contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans to be approximately   $10 million   in the aggregate for 2016. The Company s cash taxes paid in the first nine months of   2016   were   $19.4 million  .  The Company expects to pay cash taxes of approximately   $20 million   in the aggregate for 2016. The Company s purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures in the first nine months of   2016   were   $25.9 million   and   $33.1 million  , respectively. The Company expects purchases of permanent wall displays and capital expenditures to be approximately   $50.0 million   and   $65.0 million  , respectively, in the aggregate for 2016. Upon closing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the Company disclosed that it expected to achieve approximately $140 million of synergies and cost reductions over a multi-year period through the elimination of duplicative activities, leveraging purchasing scale and optimizing the manufacturing and distribution networks of the combined company. The Company anticipates achieving its expected synergies and cost reductions. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company s total debt. 
  The Company has undertaken, and continues to assess, refine and implement, a number of programs to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending.  In the ordinary course of business, the Company s source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows. 
  Continuing to execute the Company s business strategy could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining the Company s approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure, including optimizing the Colomer Acquisition, the CBB Acquisition,  the Cutex International Acquisition and/or the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company s total debt.  
  The Company may also, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions.  Any retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. 
  The Company expects that operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to pay its operating expenses for 2016, including expenses in connection with the execution of the Company s business strategy, payments in connection with the Company's synergy and integration programs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, purchases of permanent wall displays, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments and costs, cash tax payments, pension and other post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company s restructuring programs, business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any, severance not otherwise included in the Company s restructuring programs, debt and/or equity repurchases, if any, costs related to litigation, discontinuing non-core business lines and/or entering and/or exiting certain territories and/or channels of trade.  
  There can be no assurance that available funds will be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements on a consolidated basis.  If the Company s anticipated level of revenues is not achieved because of, among other things, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products in one or more of the Consumer, Elizabeth Arden, Professional and/or Other segments; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company s products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company s competitors and/or decreased performance by third party suppliers; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; or less than anticipated results from the Company s existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company s expenses, including, without limitation, for synergy and integration programs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, restructuring costs, acquisition and integration costs, costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional and marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company s current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements.  
  Any such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company s revenues and operating income and could adversely affect Products Corporation s ability to comply with certain financial and/or other covenants under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture and/or 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture and in such event the Company could be required to take measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending. (See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Revlon, Inc.'s 2015 Form 10-K, as updated by Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q, for further discussion of certain risks associated with the Company's business and indebtedness.) 
    
   Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts 
  Products Corporation enters into FX Contracts and option contracts from time to time to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company s foreign and domestic operations. The FX Contracts are entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company s foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. At September 30, 2016, the FX Contracts outstanding had a notional amount of   $122.8 million   and a net liability fair value of   $1.7 million  . 
  Interest Rate Swap Transaction  
  In November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction with a   1.00%   floor, based on a notional amount of   $400 million   in respect of indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan over a period of   three   years (the "2013 Interest Rate Swap"). The Company designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments related to the   $400 million   notional amount under Products Corporation's Acquisition Term Loan over the   three  -year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. In connection with entering into the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the 2013 Interest Swap was carried over to apply to a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under such loan for the remaining balance of the term of such swap.  Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or   1.00%  , while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to   2.0709%   (which, with respect to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at   5.5709%   over the remaining balance of the   three  -year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value of such swap was recorded in the Statement of Operations  .   The fair value of the Company's 2013 Interest Rate Swap at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 was a liability of   $6.3 million   and $6.5 million, respectively. 
  Credit Risk 
  Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of the derivative instruments in asset positions, which totaled   $1.4 million   and   $2.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties. Given the current credit standing of the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments, the Company believes the risk of loss arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties under these derivative instruments is remote.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Sensitivity  
  The Company has exposure to changing interest rates primarily under Products Corporation's 2016 Term Loan Facility and its 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company manages interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt.  The Company from time to time makes use of derivative financial instruments to adjust its fixed and floating rate ratio, such as with the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.   
  The qualitative and quantitative information presented in Item 7A of Revlon, Inc.'s 2015 Form 10-K ("Item 7A") describes significant aspects of the Company's financial instrument program that have material market risk as of December 31, 2015. The following tables present this information as required by Item 7A as of   September 30, 2016  .  

(a)   
    Weighted average variable rates are based upon implied forward rates from the U.S. Dollar LIBOR and Euribor yield curves at   September 30, 2016  . 
               (b)   
    Includes total quarterly amortization payments required within each year under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. 
      If any of LIBOR, Euribor, the base rate, the U.S. federal funds rate or such equivalent local foreign currency rate increases, Products Corporation's debt service costs will increase to the extent that Products Corporation has elected such rates for its outstanding loans. Based on the amounts outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement and the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement and other short-term borrowings (which, in the aggregate, are Products Corporation s only debt currently subject to floating interest rates) as of   September 30, 2016  , a 1% increase in both the LIBOR and Euribor rates would increase the Company s annual interest expense by   $15.0 million  . 
  In November 2013, Products Corporation executed the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, which is a forward-starting, floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction with a 1.00% floor, based on a notional amount of   $400 million   in respect of indebtedness under Products Corporation's then-existing Acquisition Term Loan over a period of   three   years. The Company designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments related to the   $400 million   notional amount under Products Corporation's then-existing Acquisition Term Loan over the   three  -year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap.  In connection with entering into the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the 2013 Interest Swap was carried over to apply to a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under such loan for the remaining balance of the term of such swap.  
  Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of the three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or 1.00%, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to   2.0709%   (which, with respect to the  
  
   52 

    REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  (all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

2016 Term Loan Facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at   5.5709%   over the remaining balance of the   three  -year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap).  The fair value of the Company's 2013 Interest Rate Swap at   September 30, 2016   was a liability of   $6.3 million  . 
    
  Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
  The Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  In addition, a portion of the Company's borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to market risk associated with exchange rate movement. The Company from time to time hedges major foreign currency cash exposures through foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Products Corporation enters into these contracts with major financial institutions in an attempt to minimize counterparty risk. These contracts generally have a duration of less than 12 months and are primarily against the U.S. Dollar. In addition, Products Corporation enters into foreign currency swaps to hedge intercompany financing transactions. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures    
  (a)   Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Based upon such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
  (b)   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  .      There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  The entities acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition have been excluded from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 because they were acquired by the Company in a business combination in September 2016.  

Forward-Looking Statements  
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as well as the Company's other public documents and statements, may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, expectations, estimates, projections, assumptions, forecasts, plans, anticipations, targets, outlooks, initiatives, visions, objectives, strategies, opportunities, drivers, focus and intents of the Company s management. While the Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the Company cautions that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known and unknown factors, and, of course, it is impossible for the Company to anticipate all factors that could affect its results. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Such statements include, without limitation, the Company's expectations and estimates (whether qualitative or quantitative) as to:  
           (i) 
    the Company's future financial performance; 
              (ii) 
    the effect on sales of decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products in the Consumer, Elizabeth Arden, Professional and/or Other segments; adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company s products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company s competitors and/or decreased performance by third party suppliers, changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or among sales channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company s existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company s expenses, including, without limitation, for pension expense under its benefit plans, acquisition-related integration costs, costs related to the Company s synergy and integration programs in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, restructuring costs, acquisition and integration costs, costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional and marketing activities, or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses;  
              (iii) 
    the Company's belief that the continued execution of its business strategy could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition, repackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands, (including through licensing transactions, if any), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include exiting certain territories), further refining its approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its manufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure, including optimizing the Colomer Acquisition, the CBB Acquisition, the Cutex International Acquisition (including the Company's belief that such acquisition enhances and complements the Company's existing brand portfolio of nail care products) and/or the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and related synergy, integration and other related costs, any of which, the intended purpose of which would be to create value through improving the Company's financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing charges related to executing against such opportunities, which activities may be funded with cash on hand, funds available under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or other permitted additional sources of capital, which actions could increase the Company s total debt; 
              (iv) 
    the Company s belief that it is building a combined organization that is entrepreneurial, agile and boldly creative, with a passion for beauty, that it has strategic brand builders developing a diverse portfolio of iconic brands that delight consumers around the world wherever and however they shop for beauty and that it strives to be an ethical company that values inclusive leadership and is committed to sustainable and responsible growth and the Company s belief in its strategy that is based on three key pillars: (a) building a foundation for sustainable growth that outpaces the industry; competing in large and fast growing beauty segments and building our portfolio of product offerings in all strategic categories; further strengthening and diversifying our channels of distribution, especially direct to consumer; strengthening our U.S. business and expanding into faster growing territories, with a special focus on Asia; (b) harnessing the power of our iconic brand portfolio to delight consumers wherever and however they shop for beauty; continuing to focus on restoring the appeal and aspiration of our flagship brands and investing in them; advancing our digital and omni-channel capabilities, and focusing on high-growth channels, especially e-commerce; continuing to win in traditional channels, while expanding our combined reach into travel retail; and (c) developing  a cost structure to deliver world class profitability; continuing to improve our operating performance by strategically allocating investments behind key brands, categories and regions; further improving our category mix and, with the acquisition of Elizabeth Arden, shifting toward higher gross margin categories; continuing to reduce the complexity of our product lineup and seeking to reduce our product returns, sales markdowns and inventory levels; and, through enhanced new product development processes, increasing our speed to shelf, optimizing our resource allocation and shortening new product launch timing; 
              (v) 
    the effect of restructuring activities, restructuring costs and charges, the timing of restructuring payments and the benefits from such activities; including, without limitation, the Company s expectation (a) that the 2015 Efficiency Program will drive certain organizational efficiencies across the Company's Consumer and Professional segments and reduce general and administrative expenses within the Consumer and Professional segments; (b) that the Company will recognize a total of approximately   $12.0 million   of restructuring and related charges for the 2015 Efficiency Program by the end of 2017; (c) that cash payments related to the 2015 Efficiency Program will total approximately   $12 million  , including   $0.2 million   for capital expenditures (which capital expenditures are excluded from total restructuring and related charges expected to be recognized for the 2015 Efficiency Program), of which   $4.2 million   is expected to be paid during the remainder of 2016, with the remaining balance expected to be paid in 2017; and (d) that approximately   $9 million   of cost reductions from the 2015 Efficiency Program are expected to benefit 2016 results and that annualized cost reductions thereafter are expected to be approximately $10 million to $15 million by the end of 2018; 
              (vi) 
    the Company s expectation that operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under Products Corporation's 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to cover its operating expenses for 2016, including the cash requirements referred to in item (viii) below, and the Company's beliefs that (a) the cash generated by its domestic operations and availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit should be sufficient to meet its domestic liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, and (b) restrictions or taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings will not have a material effect on the Company's liquidity during such period; 
              (vii) 
    the Company s expected principal sources of funds, including operating revenues, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under Products Corporation's 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and other permitted lines of credit, as well as the availability of funds from the Company taking certain measures, including, among other things, reducing discretionary spending; 
              (viii) 
    the Company's expected principal uses of funds, including amounts required for the payment of operating expenses, including expenses in connection with the continued execution of the Company s business strategy; payments in connection with the Company s synergy and integration programs related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; payments in connection with the Company's purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement benefit plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including through licensing transactions, if any); severance not otherwise included in the Company s restructuring programs; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories and/or channels of trade (including, without limitation, that the Company may also, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its indebtedness based upon market conditions and that any retirement or purchase of debt and/or equity may be funded with operating cash flows of the business or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material); and its estimates of the amount and timing of such operating and other expenses;   
              (ix) 
    matters concerning the Company's market-risk sensitive instruments, as well as the Company s expectations as to the counterparty s performance, including that any risk of loss under its derivative instruments arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties is remote; 
              (x) 
    the Company's expectation to efficiently manage its working capital, including, among other things, initiatives intended to optimize inventory levels over time; centralized procurement to secure discounts and efficiencies; prudent management of trade receivables and accounts payable; and controls on general and administrative spending; and the Company s belief that in the ordinary course of business, its source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows;  
              (xi) 
    the Company s expectations regarding its future net periodic benefit cost for its U.S. and international defined benefit plans; 
              (xii) 
    the Company's expectation that its tax provision and effective tax rate in any individual quarter and year-to-date period will vary and may not be indicative of the Company's tax provision and effective tax rate for the full year; 
              (xiii) 
    the Company' s belief that the ultimate outcome of Elizabeth Arden's protests, appeals and/or judicial processes with regards to the Elizabeth Arden IRS audit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows; 
              (xiv) 
    the Company belief the allegations contained in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint are without merit and its plans to vigorously defend against them and its belief  that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, but that in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company s operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company s income for that particular period;  
              (xv) 
    certain estimates used by management in estimating the fair value of the assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the Cutex International Acquisition; and 
              (xvi) 
    the Company's expected benefits from the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, including, without limitation: (a) benefiting from greater scale, an expanded global footprint and, with the addition of Elizabeth Arden s growing prestige fragrances, skin care and color cosmetics, a significant presence across all major beauty channels and categories; (b) leveraging the Company s scale across major vendors and manufacturing partners, improving distribution and procurement efficiencies; (c) achieving approximately $140 million of synergies and cost reductions over a multi-year period through the elimination of duplicative activities, leveraging purchasing scale and optimizing the manufacturing and distribution networks of the combined company; (d) achieving additional growth through opportunities presented by the combined company s expanded sales channels and geographies; (e) expanding category mix, as the Company s strength and expertise in color cosmetics, hair care, men s grooming, anti-perspirants, deodorants and beauty tools are complemented by the addition of Elizabeth Arden s world-class portfolio of licensed prestige fragrances and the internationally recognized line of Elizabeth Arden-branded prestige fragrance, skin care and color cosmetics products, which are highly profitable categories that the Company believes are key to future industry growth; (f) diversifying the Company s channels, as Elizabeth Arden s strong global reach in prestige distribution and travel retail complement Revlon s strength in mass and salons, strongly positioning the combined company in all key beauty channels; (g) broadening the Company s geographic footprint, as post-acquisition, the combined company now markets and distributes its products in approximately 150 countries and that with Elizabeth Arden s presence in important international growth regions, including Asia Pacific, the combined company will be better positioned to compete globally.

In addition to factors that may be described in the Company's filings with the SEC, including this filing, the following factors, among others, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by the Company:

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings    
    
  The Company is involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company s operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company s income for that particular period. 
    
  As previously disclosed, following the announcement of the execution of the Elizabeth Arden Merger Agreement, several putative shareholder class action lawsuits and a derivative lawsuit were filed challenging the Merger. In addition to the complaints filed on behalf of plaintiffs Parker, Christiansen, Ross and Stein, on July 25, 2016, a lawsuit (Hutson v. Elizabeth Arden, Inc., et al., Case No. CACE-16-013566) (referred to as the  Hutson complaint ) was filed in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida (the  Court ) against Elizabeth Arden, the members of the board of directors of Elizabeth Arden, Revlon, Products Corporation and Acquisition Sub. In general, the Hutson complaint alleges that: (i) the members of Elizabeth Arden s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Elizabeth Arden s shareholders with respect to the Merger, by, among other things, approving the Merger pursuant to an unfair process and at an inadequate and unfair price; and (ii) Revlon, Products Corporation and Acquisition Sub aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by the members of Elizabeth Arden s board. The plaintiff seeks relief similar to that sought in the Parker case. 
  By Order dated August 4, 2016, all five cases were consolidated by the Court into a Consolidated Amended Class Action.  Thereafter, on August 11, 2016 a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint was filed, seeking to enjoin defendants from consummating the Merger and/or from soliciting shareholder votes. To the extent that the Merger was consummated, the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint seeks to rescind the Merger or recover rescissory or other compensatory damages, along with costs and fees. The grounds for relief set forth in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in large part track those grounds as asserted in the five individual complaints, as previously disclosed. Class counsel advised that post consummation of the Merger they were going to file a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, but to date no such complaint has been filed. 
  The Company believes the allegations contained in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement or the Merger may be filed in the future. 
  The Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company s operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company s income for that particular period. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  
  In addition to the other information in this report, investors should consider carefully the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Revlon, Inc.'s 2015 Form 10-K, as well as the following updates to such risk factors: 
  The results of the U.K. s referendum on its withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and the Company's business. 
  The Company is a multinational company with worldwide operations, including material business operations in Europe. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the U.K. formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal from the European Union.  These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to  
  
   55 

    REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future U.K. laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the U.K., increase costs, depress economic activity, restrict the Company s access to capital and make regulatory compliance and the distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and sales and marketing of the Company s products more difficult or costly. If the U.K. and the European Union are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other European Union member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the U.K. and other European Union member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. Approximately 5% of the Company's net sales are in the U.K. and approximately 20% of the Company's net sales are in the remainder of the European Union. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
    
  The Company's success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of its products. 
    
  The Company's success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of its products. If the Company's products are found or alleged to be defective or unsafe, or if they fail to meet customer or consumer standards, the Company's relationships with its customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of the Company's brands could be diminished, and the Company could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
    
  The Company may not realize the anticipated synergies, net cost reductions and growth opportunities from the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.  
    
  The benefits that the Company expects to achieve as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition will depend, in part, on the ability of the combined company to realize anticipated growth opportunities, net cost reductions and synergies. The Company s success in realizing these growth opportunities, net cost reductions and synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the Company s historical business and operations and the historical business and operations of Elizabeth Arden. Even if the Company is able to integrate the businesses and operations of Products Corporation and Elizabeth Arden successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities, net cost reductions and synergies that the Company currently expects from this integration within the anticipated time frame or at all. For example, the Company may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, the Company may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of its business and Elizabeth Arden s business. While the Company anticipates that certain expenses will be incurred, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the Acquisition may be offset by costs or delays incurred in integrating the businesses. The projected net cost reductions and synergies related to the Acquisition are based on a number of assumptions relating to the Company s business and Elizabeth Arden s business. Those assumptions may be inaccurate, and, as a result, the Company s projected net cost reductions and synergies may be inaccurate, and the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
    
  In connection with the Acquisition, we have assumed potential liabilities relating to Elizabeth Arden s business. 
    
  In connection with the Acquisition, we have assumed potential liabilities relating to Elizabeth Arden s business. To the extent we have not identified such liabilities or miscalculated their potential financial impact, these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 

Item 5.  Other Information  
    
  Appointment of E. Scott Beattie as Director.  
    
  In connection with transition and integration efforts related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, on November 3, 2016 (the  Effective Date ), Revlon s Board of Directors appointed E. Scott Beattie, Elizabeth Arden s former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as a member of Revlon s Board of Directors in the capacity of non-executive Vice-Chairman.  As of the Effective Date, Mr. Beattie will no longer be an employee of the Company, but will assume the role of Senior Advisor to Fabian T.

With the appointment of Mr. Beattie, Revlon s Board will be comprised of 14 members, 6 of whom constitute independent Directors under NYSE and SEC standards.

    REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  (all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 

On November 3, 2016, the Company and Mr. Beattie entered into an agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of his position as Senior Advisor to the Company s CEO (the  Consulting Agreement ). Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, beginning on the Effective Date, Mr. Beattie will provide advisory services to the CEO related to transition and integration efforts (the  Advisory Services ) for up to three years following the Effective Date (the  Advisory Period ). The Company will pay Mr. Beattie a fee of $500,000 per year (the  Advisory Fees ) for as long as Mr. Beattie continues to provide the Advisory Services.  The Advisory Fees are inclusive of compensation that Mr. Beattie would have been otherwise eligible to receive for his service as a non-employee member of Revlon's Board.  In connection with his appointment to Revlon's Board and his entry into the Consulting Agreement, the Company granted to Mr. Beattie a number of restricted stock units equal to $3 million divided by the NYSE closing price of Revlon Class A Common Stock on the Effective Date (the  RSU Grant ).  The RSU Grant will vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the Effective Date, subject to accelerated vesting upon the occurrence of any  change of control  (as defined in the award agreement evidencing the RSU Grant (the  2016 Restricted Stock Unit Agreement , a copy of which is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q as Exhibit 10.2.)) 
    
  The Company may elect to terminate the Advisory Services prior to the end of the Advisory Period upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) Mr. Beattie s willful failure to provide or perform the Advisory Services; (ii) Mr. Beattie s commission of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude; or (iii) breach by Mr. Beattie of the non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and non-disparagement restrictions contained in the Consulting Agreement, in each case, following notice by the Company and a period to cure (collectively, the  Restrictive Covenants  and any event under (i), (ii) or (iii),  Cause ). The Company may also terminate the Advisory Services at any time, and Mr. Beattie may terminate the Advisory Services if he is not nominated to Revlon's Board for any given year during the Advisory Period, provided that if the Advisory Services are terminated in either of those scenarios, the Company will continue to pay Mr. Beattie the Advisory Fees through the end of the Advisory Period, and Mr. Beattie would remain eligible to continue to vest in the RSU Grant in accordance with the original vesting schedule.  Mr. Beattie will receive these same payments and benefits in the event the Advisory Services are terminated as a result of his death or disability. Mr. Beattie s receipt of the Advisory Fees and his eligibility to vest in the RSU Grant are, under all circumstances, subject to his continuous compliance with the Restrictive Covenants. The foregoing description of the Consulting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q as Exhibit 10.1. 
    
  In connection with Mr. Beattie s appointment to serve as non-executive Vice Chairman of Revlon's Board, on November 3, 2016, Revlon's Board approved the amendment and restatement of Revlon s By-laws, effective as of that date, to provide for the role of non-executive Vice Chairman.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person s conduct was unlawful. 
  Section 2.        Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation  .

    Exhibit 3.1 

by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 
  Section 3.        Authorization of Indemnification  .  Any indemnification under this Article X (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2, and in each case Section 11, of this Article X, as the case may be.  Such determination shall be made (i) by a majority vote of the directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders.  To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys  fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. 
  Section 4.        Good Faith Defined  .  For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article X, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful, if such person s action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise.  The term  another enterprise  as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity or enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent.

   19 
  #4823-5603-4093v6 

    Exhibit 3.1 

circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2, and in each case Section 11, of this Article X, as the case may be.  Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article X nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct.  Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application.  If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

           (i) 
    If the Advisory Period is terminated pursuant to subsections (ii) or (iii) of   Section 1(f)   of this Agreement, Beattie will continue to vest in the RSU Grant in accordance with the Original Vesting Schedule, so long as Beattie has not committed a Restrictive Covenant Breach.

              (i) 
    the third anniversary of the Effective Date (such three-year period from the Effective Date, the    Complete Term    
              (ii) 
    the date on which the Board and/or the CEO notifies Beattie that it no longer requires Beattie s provision of the Advisory Services for any reason other than for Cause (as defined below), or the date of Beattie s death or permanent and total disability; 
              (iii) 
    the date on which Beattie terminates the Advisory Period as a result of the Company s failure to nominate him to the Board (other than in connection with the existence of Cause); 
              (iv) 
    the date on which Beattie notifies the Board and/or the CEO that he no longer wishes to provide the Advisory Services for any or no reason; or 
              (v) 
    the date on which Beattie is terminated by the Company as a result of his commission of any of the following act(s):  (A) the willful material

Where the maximum period of 60 days for the Release to become effective and irrevocable spans two taxable years, the Release Effective Date shall be no earlier than the first business day of the second taxable year, subject to any further delays (if applicable) required pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Release    shall mean a form of general release in favor of the Company and its affiliates substantially similar to the  General Release  included in the Separation and Release Agreement entered into between the parties on November 2, 2016 (the    Separation Agreement   ).

   4 

Exhibit 10.1 

and officers insurance policy, as in effect from time.  By signing this Agreement, Beattie represents that, prior to or as of the Execution Date, he has resigned from all other positions that he holds as a director, officer or otherwise with Elizabeth Arden, subject to the terms of the Separation Agreement, and agrees to promptly provide any documentation memorializing such actions as may be requested by the Board.  Beattie may continue to serve as a member of the executive committee of the board of directors of the Personal Care Products Council (f/k/a the Cosmetic, Toiletry   Fragrance Association) on behalf of the Company, and may continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of Red Door Spa, in each case, provided that the Board in its sole discretion has not requested that Beattie cease to perform such service. 
  3.        COOPERATION  .  Beattie agrees, without limitation as to time, to provide his attendance and truthful testimony where deemed appropriate by the Board, with respect to any investigation or the Company s defense or prosecution of any existing or future claims with respect to any matters about which Beattie has knowledge by virtue of providing the Advisory Services, by virtue of serving as a member of the Board or by virtue of his prior services to Elizabeth Arden.  Such assistance and cooperation shall be provided by Beattie without fee or charge, other than the Company s reimbursement of reasonable travel expenses.  Assistance shall be given at locations and times mutually agreed upon by Beattie and the Company, except with respect to mandated court appearances for which Beattie will make himself available upon reasonable notice.   
  4.        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  .      Unless the Board or CEO consents or directs Beattie in writing, he will not at any time during or after his service with the Company, use any Confidential Information (as defined in this   Section 4  ) for his own benefit or disclose any Confidential Information to anyone outside the Company or to any employee or consultant of the Company not also having authorized access to and a legitimate need to know such Confidential Information, nor shall he direct anyone else to do so.  In the event Beattie is requested or required to make disclosure of any Confidential Information under any court order, subpoena or other judicial process, he will promptly notify the Company, take all reasonable steps requested by the Company to defend against the compulsory disclosure and permit the Company to take control with counsel of its choice in any proceeding relating to the compulsory disclosure.

   5 

Exhibit 10.1 

the Company or its affiliates, directly or indirectly relating to the past, present or anticipated business affairs of the Company or its affiliates.  Beattie understands that he may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of Confidential Information that: (a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, or to his attorney, either directly or indirectly; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a law suit or other proceeding.  The restrictions set forth in this   Section 4   are in addition to, and concurrent with, any confidentiality or similar restrictions, agreements or covenants by which Beattie is otherwise bound. 
  5.        NON-COMPETITION  .  During the Restricted Period (as defined in this   Section 5  ), Beattie shall not have any direct or indirect interest (whether as a director, officer, stockholder, partner, proprietor, associate, employee, consultant, owner, agent or independent contractor) in any Restricted Entity (as defined in this   Section 5  ), or engage in any other activity or relationship which would be contrary to the Company's conflict of interest policy as set forth in the Revlon Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, as in effect from time to time.  This prohibition does not apply to solely owning, directly or indirectly, (i) not more than one percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of a corporation, the shares of which are regularly traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market that would otherwise constitute a Restricted Entity, or (ii) not more than five percent of the equity interests in any passive private investment fund that may be invested in a Restricted Entity.  A    Restricted Entity    shall mean any other corporation, firm or business engaged in a consumer or professional cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, skincare, beauty product and/or spa or salon business, or any other business that is competitive, in any geographical area, with any business of the Company or any of its affiliates.  The    Restricted Period    shall mean the Advisory Period and: (A) in the event the Advisory Period is terminated pursuant to subsection (iv) of   Section 1(f)   of this Agreement, the one-year period following the date on which the Advisory Period so terminates, subject to the Company s continuation of the Advisory Fees during such one-year period; (B) in the event the Company terminates the Advisory Period pursuant to subsections (ii) or (iii) of   Section 1(f)   of this Agreement, the remainder of the Complete Term, provided that the Company honors its obligations to Beattie under   Section 1(f)   of this Agreement; or (C) if the Advisory Period is terminated for any reason other than as provided in subsections (A) and (B) of this   Section 5  , the one-year period following the date on which the Advisory Period terminates (but not beyond the Complete Term).  The restrictions set forth in this   Section 5   are in addition to, and concurrent with, any non-competition or similar restrictions, agreements or covenants by which Beattie is otherwise bound. 
  6.        NON-SOLICITATION  .   Beattie hereby agrees that, during the Restricted Period, he will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, influence, or attempt to solicit, induce or influence, any person then or previously employed by or providing services to the Company or its affiliates to terminate his or her employment or other service relationship with the Company or its affiliates, or otherwise interfere with any such employment by or association with the Company or its affiliates for the purpose of associating, as an employee  
  
   6 

Exhibit 10.1 

or otherwise, with any Restricted Entity (as defined in   Section 6  ) or otherwise encourage any such employee or other service provider to leave his or her employment or service with the Company.  Further, Beattie hereby agrees that he will not, at any time during the Restricted Period, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, influence, or attempt to solicit, induce or influence, any customer, supplier, licensor and/or vendor of the Company or its affiliates to divert his, her or its business to any Restricted Entity or otherwise encourage such customer, supplier, licensor and/or vendor to terminate its business relationship with the Company or its affiliates or otherwise interfere with any business or contractual relationship of the Company or its affiliates that may exist from time to time, including but not limited to with any supplier, customer, licensor and/or vendor. The restrictions set forth in this   Section 6   are in addition to, and concurrent with, any non-solicitation or similar restrictions, agreements or covenants by which Beattie is otherwise bound. 
  7.        NON-DISPARAGEMENT  .  Beattie agrees and acknowledges that he will not at any time make any statement (orally or in writing) or take any action which, in any way, disparages the Company or any of its affiliates.  The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall instruct its officers and members of the Board not to, disparage, criticize or defame Beattie.  Nothing in this   Section 7   shall prohibit the Company, its affiliates, Beattie or any other person or entity from providing truthful and accurate facts where required by lawfully compelled testimony; provided that Beattie notifies the Company in advance of any such testimony by Beattie and cooperates with the Company s reasonable efforts with respect to such testimony, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  This   Section 7   will survive in perpetuity.   
  8.        BREACH OF AGREEMENT  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Beattie agrees that the Company may immediately cease further payment of the Advisory Services Pay and that Beattie will forfeit any further vesting in the RSU Grant, and the Company s obligation to provide any additional consideration under this Agreement will be void, in the event Beattie commits a Restrictive Covenant Breach.  Beattie agrees that if there is a Restrictive Covenant Breach, it will be difficult to measure the exact amount of damages.  Beattie understands and agrees that a Restrictive Covenant Breach will constitute a material breach of this Agreement which will cause the Company to suffer immediate, substantial and irreparable injury, and which will be a sufficient basis for a court to award injunctive relief (without the necessity to post bond) and monetary damages to the Company without affecting the remainder of this Agreement. 
  9.        SECTION 409A  .  The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement shall comply with or be exempt from Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and applicable guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively    Code Section 409A   ) and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance therewith.  In no event whatsoever shall the Company or its affiliates be liable for any tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on Beattie by Code Section 409A or any damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A or otherwise.  To the extent any taxable expense reimbursement or in-kind benefits under this Agreement is subject to Code Section 409A, the amount thereof eligible in any calendar year shall not affect the  
  
   7 

Exhibit 10.1 

amount eligible for any other calendar year, in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the year in which Beattie incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or receipt of in-kind benefits be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if Beattie is a  specified employee  (within the meaning of Code Section 409A and determined pursuant to any policies adopted by the Company consistent with Code Section 409A), at the time of Beattie s separation from service, and if any portion of the payments or benefits to be received by Beattie upon separation from service would be considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A and cannot be paid or provided to Beattie without Beattie incurring taxes, interest or penalties under Code Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable pursuant to this Agreement and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, during the six-month period immediately following Beattie s separation from service will instead be paid or made available on the earlier of (i) the first business day of the seventh month following the date of Beattie s separation from service or (ii) Beattie s death.  Each payment under this Agreement is intended to be a  separate payment  and not one of a series of payments for purposes of Code Section 409A. 
  10.        GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY  .  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of New York applicable to transactions executed and to be wholly performed in New York between residents thereof, without regard to the state s conflict of law provisions that would require application of the laws of a different jurisdiction, except as otherwise preempted by the laws of the United States.  The parties consent and agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts sitting in the County of New York for all purposes.  ALSO, AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION BASED ON THIS AGREEMENT OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONSULTING RELATIONSHIP, OR ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO.  If any action shall be brought to enforce or interpret any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, the party that substantially prevails shall be entitled to its or his reasonable attorneys  fees and costs. 
  11.        ENTIRE AGREEMENT  .  Except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement, the RSU Agreement and the Separation Agreement, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings, written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof including, but not limited to, any emails or term sheets.  No representation, promise or inducement has been made by either party that is not embodied in this Agreement, and neither party shall be bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise or inducement not so set forth.  In entering into, performing and enforcing this Agreement, each of Beattie and the Company disclaim any reliance whatsoever on any representations, warranties, promises, understandings or arrangements that are not expressly set forth, or referred to, in this Agreement.  The failure  
  
   8 

Exhibit 10.1 

of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered a waiver thereof or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.   
  12.        ASSIGNMENT  .  This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assignees.  This Agreement, and Beattie s rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by the parties, nor may the parties pledge, encumber or anticipate any payments or benefits due hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise.   
  13.        SEVERABILITY  .  Any provision of this Agreement that is held to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law or regulation shall, to the extent of any such invalidity or unenforceability, be deemed by the parties (a) to be modified to the extent necessary to cure such invalidity or unenforceability and to carry out so far as possible the intention manifested by the provision in question or (b) if necessary, to be omitted from this Agreement, but such invalidity or unenforceability, and such resulting modification or omission, shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 
  14.        CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT  .  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each party has reviewed and negotiated the terms and provisions of this Agreement and has contributed to its drafting.  Accordingly, the rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.  Rather, the terms of this Agreement shall be construed fairly as to both parties hereto and not in favor or against either party.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.2 

Restricted Stock Unit Agreement 
    
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED REVLON, INC. STOCK PLAN 
    
  This RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (this  Agreement ) is entered into between REVLON, INC., a Delaware corporation ( Revlon  and, together with Revlon s affiliates, the  Company ), and E. Scott Beattie, a non-employee director of Revlon (the  Grantee ) on November 3, 2016 (the  Grant Date ), subject to the Grantee s acceptance of this Agreement. 
    
  Revlon s Compensation Committee (the  Committee ) has determined that the objectives of the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan, as amended (the  Plan ), will be furthered by granting to the Grantee Restricted Stock Units, subject to certain restrictions, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter contained ( RSUs  or the  Restricted Stock Unit Award ).  Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Revlon, Inc. Class A common stock ( Common Stock ), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this  Agreement ). 
    
  In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual undertakings set forth in this Agreement, the Company and the Grantee agree as follows: 
    
  SECTION 1  .    Notice of Grant; Grant of RSUs  .  Subject to Section 9 of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to the Grantee the number of RSUs designated in the notice of grant from the Company which accompanies this Agreement as   Schedule 2   hereto, or the online award summary referred to therein (the  Notice of Grant ).  However, the Grantee shall have no right to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock subject to the RSUs except to the extent such RSUs have vested.  Prior to the actual delivery of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company.  The Grantee shall not be required to make any payment for the RSUs. 
    
    SECTION 2  .   Restrictions  .   
    
  (a)    Vesting of RSUs  . For so long as the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not be canceled pursuant to the terms of the Plan or this Agreement (or the consulting and transition agreement entered into between the Company and the Grantee on November 2, 2016 (the  Transition Agreement )), one-third of the RSUs shall vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the Grant Date (the  Original Vesting Schedule ).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the RSUs which are the subject of this Agreement shall immediately vest upon a  Change of Control,  as defined in   Schedule 1   hereto. 
    
  (b)    Issuance of Shares  .  No shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered to the Grantee prior to the date on which the RSUs vest.  As soon as reasonably practicable after any RSUs vest, but in no event more than 10 days following the applicable vesting event, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall cause to be issued to the Grantee (in book-entry form or otherwise) shares of Common Stock with respect to such vested RSUs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no RSUs that vest upon a Change of Control will be settled on such Change of Control unless such Change of Control is also a  change in effective control  or  change in ownership  under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (in either case, a    409A Change of Control   ).  If such Change of Control is not also a 409A Change of Control, then any vested RSUs (or other form of consideration) received by shareholders of the Company in respect of shares of Common Shares in connection with such Change of Control shall be delivered to the Grantee no more than 10 days following the applicable vesting date on which the RSUs would have otherwise vested in accordance with the Original Vesting Schedule. 

Exhibit 10.2 

SECTION 3.      Rights as Stockholder  .  Neither the Grantee nor any person claiming under or through the Grantee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any shares of Common Stock deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such shares of Common Stock (which may be in book-entry form) have been issued and recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars and delivered to the Grantee (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account), including, but not limited to, the right to vote and to receive dividends and other distributions.  After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Grantee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to such shares. 
    
  SECTION 4.      Taxes  .  The Grantee is liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the RSUs, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any tax obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs.  The Company makes no representation or undertaking regarding the tax treatment in connection with the grant or vesting of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the RSUs.  The Company does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Grantee s tax liability.  The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that he is not an employee of the Company and that, as a non-employee director of Revlon, the Grantee will be required to pay (and the Company will not withhold or remit) any applicable taxes in connection with the RSUs.   
    SECTION 5.      Termination of Service with the Company  .  
  (a)    Subject to Section 5(b) below, effective as of the date of the Grantee s termination of service with the Company for any reason, all RSUs which are unvested as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement shall be canceled, except to the extent the Committee may otherwise determine.  
  (b)    In the event that the Grantee s service with the Company is terminated pursuant to subsections (ii) or (iii) of Section 1(f) of the Transition Agreement, the Grantee shall continue to vest in the RSUs in accordance with the Original Vesting Schedule as and to the extent provided in Section 1(e) of the Transition Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.   
   (c)    Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer upon the Grantee or any other person the right to continue in the service of the Company or affect any right which the Company may have to terminate the service of the Grantee or any other person. 
    
  SECTION 6.      Plan Provisions to Prevail  .  This Agreement shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions of the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time, which are incorporated hereby and made a part hereof, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 2.9(c) of the Plan (generally prohibiting the sale of shares not owned or immediately issuable and failure to duly deliver shares in settlement), Section 3.8(c) of the Plan (generally relating to waivers of claims to continued exercise or vesting of awards, damages and severance entitlements related to non-continuation of awards), Section 3.2 of the Plan (generally relating to consents required by securities and other laws), Section 3.5 of the Plan (relating to changes in capitalization) and Section 3.11 of the Plan (generally relating to the effects of certain reorganizations and other extraordinary transactions). Any term defined in the Plan shall have the same meaning in this Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein. In the event there is any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. In the event there is any inconsistency regarding the details of the grant between the records or communications of the Company s outside Stock Plan Administrator and the resolutions and/or minutes of the Committee authorizing the RSUs subject to this Agreement, the Committee s records shall prevail over the records, communications, databases and  

Exhibit 10.2 

online summaries or presentations of those grant details furnished or maintained by the Company s outside Stock Plan Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 1(e) of the Transition Agreement hereof shall govern and control over any conflicting provisions of the Plan, including without limitation the  default rules  under Section 2.10 of the Plan.      
    
  SECTION 7.      Grantee s Acknowledgment  .  By entering into this Agreement, the Grantee agrees and acknowledges that (a) he/she has received, read and understood a copy of the Plan, including Section 3.8(c) of the Plan (generally relating to waivers of claims to continued exercise or vesting of awards, damages and severance entitlements related to non-continuation of awards) and this Agreement, and accepts the RSUs upon all of the terms thereof, and (b) that no member of the Committee shall be liable for any Plan Action (as defined in the Plan), including without limitation any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award thereunder or under this Agreement. The Grantee has reviewed with his or her own advisors the tax and other consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The Grantee is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents with respect to all matters of this Agreement. 
    
  SECTION 8.      Nontransferability; Limitations on the Sale of Common Stock  .   
    
  (a)    No RSUs granted to the Grantee under this Agreement shall be assignable or transferable by the Grantee (voluntarily or by operation of law), other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution prior to vesting of the RSUs set forth in the Plan and this Agreement applicable thereto.   
    
  (b)    The Grantee may sell, assign and/or transfer the shares of Common Stock issued in respect of the RSUs pursuant to this Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to compliance with the Company s trading policies, as provided in Section 16 hereof. Unless the Committee otherwise determines, the Grantee shall not have the right to pledge, hypothecate or encumber the RSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement. Any attempt to dispose of the RSUs and the shares of Common Stock issued in respect thereof in contravention of such restrictions shall be null and void and without effect.    
    
  SECTION 9.      Conditions  .  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the grant of the RSUs pursuant to Section 1 hereof is conditioned upon and subject to the Grantee s execution and delivery to the Company of an executed copy of this Agreement (which shall be electronically accepted by the Grantee pursuant to processes prescribed by the Company).

    SECTION 11.      Successors and Assigns  .  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of the Company and, to the extent set forth in Section 3.3 of the Plan and Section 8 of this Agreement, the heirs and personal representatives of the Grantee.

This Agreement may not be altered, modified, changed or discharged, except by a writing signed by or on behalf of both Revlon and the Grantee.

  SECTION 14.         Other Company Actions  .  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Company from taking any action which is deemed by it to be appropriate or in its best interest, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on the RSUs granted under this Agreement.
