FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ) is being filed by Federal Signal Corporation and its subsidiaries (referred to collectively as the  Company,   we,   our  or  us  herein, unless the context otherwise indicates) with the United States ( U.S. ) Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and includes comments made by management that may contain words such as  may,   will,   believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   project,   estimate  and  objective  or similar terminology, or the negative thereof, concerning the Company s future financial performance, business strategy, plans, goals and objectives. These expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information concerning the Company s possible or assumed future performance or results of operations and are not guarantees. While these statements are based on assumptions and judgments that management has made in light of industry experience as well as perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances, they are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different. 
  These risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company s control, include the risk factors described under Part I, Item 1A,   Risk Factors  , of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. These factors may not constitute all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statement. The Company operates in a continually changing business environment and new factors emerge from time to time. The Company cannot predict such factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such factors on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a predictor of actual results. The Company disclaims any responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this Form 10-Q.

  NOTE   1     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Organization and Description of the Business 
  Federal Signal Corporation was founded in 1901 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1969. References herein to the  Company,   we,   our  or  us  refer collectively to Federal Signal Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
  Products manufactured and supplied, and services rendered by the Company are divided into   two   major operating segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group. The individual operating businesses are organized as such because they share certain characteristics, including technology, marketing, distribution and product application, which create long-term synergies. The Company s reportable segments are consistent with its operating segments. These segments are discussed in Note   12     Segment Information. 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of Federal Signal Corporation and its subsidiaries included herein and have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States ( U.S. ) Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to ensure the information presented is not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Company s accounting policies described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. As discussed in Note   15     Discontinued Operations, on   January 29, 2016  , the Company completed the sale of its Bronto Skylift        business ( Bronto ) that represented its Fire Rescue Group. The consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been recast to present the operating results of previously divested or exited businesses as discontinued operations, including the Fire Rescue Group. See Note   15     Discontinued Operations for further details.  
  In addition, as discussed in Note   2     Acquisitions, on   June 3, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Joe Johnson Equipment, Inc. and Joe Johnson Equipment (USA), Inc. (collectively,  JJE ), a Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016   includes preliminary fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition, whereas the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   include the post-acquisition operating results of JJE. 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that we considered necessary to present a fair statement of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These include adjustments to present the Fire Rescue Group as a discontinued operation, as well as certain reclassifications made to prior-year balance sheet information to conform to the current-year presentation, after giving effect to the JJE acquisition. 
  The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. While we label our quarterly information using a calendar convention whereby our first, second and third quarters are labeled as ending on March 31, June 30 and September 30, respectively, it is our longstanding practice to establish interim quarterly closing dates based on a 13-week period ending on a Saturday, with our fiscal year ending on December 31. The effects of this practice are not material and exist only within a reporting year. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Changes 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition  . This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  
  FEDERAL SIGNAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (CONTINUED) 
  (Unaudited) 

recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The ASU allows either a  full retrospective  adoption, in which the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, or a  modified retrospective  adoption, in which the guidance is applied retrospectively only to the most current period presented in the financial statements, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard being recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. As originally proposed, this guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition requirements to annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Under ASU 2015-14, companies are permitted to adopt the guidance early, but no earlier than the original effective date outlined in ASU 2014-09. The Company expects to apply the  modified retrospective  method of adoption, and is continuing to evaluate the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The new requirement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Retrospective presentation is required for all comparable periods presented. The Company s adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 855-30), Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  , which presents the SEC staff s opinion, in response to ASU No. 2015-03, that debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements may be deferred, presented as an asset, and subsequently amortized ratably over the respective term, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The effective date of this guidance, and the expected impact upon adoption, is consistent with that discussed above with respect to ASU No. 2015-03. The Company s adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires     organizations that are lessees in operating leases to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires disclosure of key qualitative and quantitative information about leasing agreements by both lessors and lessees. For a lease to meet the requirements for accounting under a sale-leaseback transaction, it must meet the criteria for a sale in ASC 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  Entities are required to recognize and measure operating leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which impacts amounts recorded in the statements of operations, the classification of awards as equity or liability on the balance sheets, and the classification of related activities on the statement of cash flows. The ASU requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and are to be recognized regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards are to be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. The Company may now elect to account for award forfeitures as they occur rather than as part of the compensation expense as the awards are vesting. The requirements for withholding now allow withholding at the maximum statutory tax rate of the beneficiary s jurisdiction. On the statement of cash flows, excess tax benefits are to be classified under operating activities and shares withheld for tax-withholding purposes are to be classified as a financing activity. These new requirements and options are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2016. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value are to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement are to be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement are to be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Payments  , which provides additional guidance on the financial statement presentation of certain activities in the statement of cash flows. The activities addressed by this guidance that may be relevant to the Company include cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and the application of the predominance principle. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If this approach is impracticable, the amendments would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect it will have a material impact on the Company s historical cash flow presentation.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, workers  compensation and product liability reserves, asset impairment, pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, income tax contingency accruals and valuation allowances, and litigation-related accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  As described in Note   2     Acquisitions, amounts allocated to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of JJE are considered preliminary as of   September 30, 2016   and are subject to change during the measurement period.  
  Significant Accounting Policies 
  There have been no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , with the exception of the following accounting policies associated with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of JJE: 
  Rental Equipment 
  The Company enters into lease agreements with customers related to the rental of certain equipment. All of these leasing agreements are classified as operating leases, and are for periods generally not to exceed   5 years  . In accounting for these leases, the cost of the equipment purchased or manufactured by the Company is recorded as an asset, and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Rental income is recognized ratably over the term of the underlying leases. 
  Rental equipment is depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives and is reviewed for potential impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares non-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on a non-discounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. 
  Rental equipment includes certain equipment that is manufactured by the Company and subsequently transferred to the rental fleet, as well as equipment purchased from third-party manufacturers, for the purpose of renting to end-customers. The related cash flow activity associated with these transactions is reflected within operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The rental income associated with this activity, which is included as a component of net sales on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, was   $6.4 million   and   $2.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $12.1 million   and   $6.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Intangible Assets 
  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment if indicators exist in a manner similar to that described above for   Rental Equipment  .  
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.  
   
  NOTE   2     ACQUISITIONS 
  Acquisition of Westech Vac Systems Ltd.    
  On   January 5, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of   100%   of the stock of Westech Vac Systems, Ltd. ( Westech ), a Canadian manufacturer of high-quality, rugged vacuum trucks, from Advance Engineered Products Ltd. The Company expects that Westech will provide an efficient entry into a new line of product offerings and access to new markets. As the acquisition closed on   January 5, 2016  , the assets and liabilities of Westech have been consolidated into the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , while the post-acquisition results of operations have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, within the Environmental Solutions Group. 
  Cash consideration paid by the Company to acquire Westech was approximately   $6.0 million  . The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Westech acquisition have been measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, resulting in an assignment of   $1.7 million   to goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, and   $1.4 million   to intangible assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s purchase price allocation is considered to be final. 
  The acquisition was not, and would not have been, material to the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flow during any period presented. Accordingly, the Company s consolidated results from operations do not differ materially from historical performance as a result of the acquisition, and therefore, pro-forma results are not presented. 
  Acquisition of JJE 
  On   June 3, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of JJE, a Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets. The Company expects that JJE will facilitate sales of its existing products into new markets, expand the Company s product and service offerings and increase the Company s footprint across North America. As the acquisition closed on   June 3, 2016  , the assets and liabilities of JJE have been consolidated into the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , while the post-acquisition results of operations have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, within the Environmental Solutions Group. 
  The initial cash consideration paid by the Company to acquire JJE was approximately   $96.6 million  , inclusive of a payment of a working capital adjustment, which was finalized subsequent to the end of the third quarter without requiring any additional payment from either party. In addition, there is a deferred payment of C  $8.0 million   (approximately   $6.1 million  ) and a contingent earn-out payment of up to C  $10.0 million   (approximately   $7.6 million  ). The earn-out payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain financial targets and objectives. The deferred payment, and any contingent earn-out payment, are due to be paid in June 2019.  
  The acquisition is being accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805,   Business Combinations  . Accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the acquisition. A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company s judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company s results of operations. The Company s purchase price allocation as of   September 30, 2016   reflects various provisional estimates that were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date and up to the subsequent filing date of this Form 10-Q. The Company believes that information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, however the determination of those fair values is not yet finalized. Thus, the preliminary measurements of fair value set forth in

the table below are subject to change during the measurement period as valuations are finalized. The Company expects to finalize the valuation and complete the purchase price allocation by the end of the fourth quarter.  
  The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:  

(a) 
    The initial purchase price was funded with existing cash on hand and borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility.  
              (b) 
    Includes estimated fair value of contingent earn-out payment (  $4.9 million  ) and the deferred payment (  $5.4 million  ) as of the acquisition date. Included as a component of   Other long-term liabilities   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note   14     Fair Value Measurements for discussion of the methodology used to determine the fair value of the contingent earn-out payment. 
              (c) 
    Represents the non-cash settlement of accounts receivable due from JJE to the Company as of the acquisition date. Corresponding amount payable by JJE to the Company is not included in accounts payable assumed in the table above, and the amount was settled at fair value with no impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.   
              (d) 
    Represents the preliminary fair value assigned to the JJE trade name, which is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset. 
              (e) 
    The majority of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
     Under ASC 805-10, acquisition related costs (i.e., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The Company incurred   $0.9 million   of acquisition related costs in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which have been recorded in   Acquisition and integration related expenses   on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
  As further explained in Note   14     Fair Value Measurements, in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized expenses of   $0.2 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, associated with the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. In addition, in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized expenses of   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, relation to the accretion of the discount on the deferred payment obligation. These expenses have been included as a component of   Acquisition and integration related expenses   on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
   In the period between the   June 3, 2016   closing date and   September 30, 2016  , on a standalone basis, JJE generated   $49.5 million   of net sales and   $0.7 million   of operating income, after recognizing expenses of   $3.0 million   and   $0.3 million   relating to purchase accounting and acquisition-related effects, respectively. The Company has included the operating results of JJE within the Environmental Solutions Group in its condensed consolidated financial statements since the closing date. 
  In connection with the acquisition of JJE, the Company entered into lease agreements for   two   facilities owned by affiliates of the sellers of JJE. Both agreements include an annual rent that is considered to be market-based, and are for an initial lease term of   five years  , with options to renew. In the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , total rent paid under these agreements to the former shareholders of JJE, some of whom are now employees of the Company, was approximately   $0.1 million  .

The Company s net sales to JJE prior to the acquisition were   $21.6 million   and   $41.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $12.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  The Company has not presented unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of the Company and JJE for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , because it is considered impracticable to do so, primarily because of the revenue and profit deferral impacts associated with the Company s historical sales to JJE. Under common ownership, the timing of revenue and profit recognition will change, in that revenue and profit will no longer be recognized on sales from the Company to JJE when delivery has occurred, and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied, as was the case prior to the acquisition. Quantification of the revenue and profit deferral impacts of such historical sales and reflecting pro forma combined results assuming the transaction occurred on January 1, 2016 and 2015 with any reasonable level of accuracy is considered impracticable as it would require significant estimates, including estimating the mix of such historical sales (i.e. sales of units to JJE that were subsequently sold to end customers, sales of units to JJE that were not yet sold through to end customers or sales of units to JJE that were placed in the rental fleet), as well as estimating the timing and amounts of any of JJE s subsequent sale or rental activity.

The table above includes preliminary estimates of the fair value and useful lives of certain definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the JJE acquisition, which was completed during the second quarter of   2016  . As further described in Note   2     Acquisitions, the preliminary measurements of fair value included in the table above are subject to change during the measurement period as valuations are finalized. 
  Amortization expense   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was immaterial.  The Company currently estimates that aggregate amortization expense will not exceed   $0.2 million   in any future year.  
   
  NOTE   5     DEBT 
  The following table summarizes the components of   Long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations  : 

As more fully described within Note   14     Fair Value Measurements, the Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of long-term debt is based on interest rates that we believe are currently available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2 input).  
  The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments: 

(a)  
    Long-term borrowings includes current portions of long-term debt and current portions of capital lease obligations of   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
     On   January 27, 2016  , the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  2016 Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the  Borrowers ), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent, KeyBank National Association, as documentation agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and the other lenders and parties signatory thereto.  
  The 2016 Credit Agreement is a   $325.0 million   revolving credit facility, maturing on   January 27, 2021  , that provides for borrowings in the form of loans or letters of credit up to the aggregate availability under the facility, with a sub-limit of   $50.0 million   for letters of credit. The 2016 Credit Agreement allows for the Borrowers to borrow in denominations of U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars (up to a maximum of C  $85.0 million  ) or euros (up to a maximum of    20.0 million  ). In addition, the Company may cause the commitments to increase by up to an additional   $75.0 million  , subject to the approval of the applicable lenders providing such additional financing. Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. 
  The Company s domestic subsidiaries provide guarantees for all obligations of the Borrowers under the 2016 Credit Agreement, which is secured by a first priority security interest in all now or hereafter acquired domestic property and assets and the stock or other equity interests in each of the domestic subsidiaries and   65%   of the outstanding voting capital stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions. 
  Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company s option, at a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from   0.00%   to   1.25%   for base rate borrowings and   1.00%   to   2.25%   for LIBOR borrowings. The Company must also pay a commitment fee to the lenders ranging between   0.15%   to  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents

0.30%   per annum on the unused portion of the   $325.0 million   revolving credit facility along with other standard fees. Letter of credit fees are payable on outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable LIBOR margin plus other customary fees. 
  The Company is subject to certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants under the 2016 Credit Agreement that are to be measured at each fiscal quarter-end. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . The 2016 Credit Agreement also includes a  covenant holiday  period, which allows for the temporary increase of the minimum leverage ratio following the completion of a permitted acquisition, or a series of permitted acquisitions, when the total consideration exceeds a specified threshold. In addition, the 2016 Credit Agreement includes customary negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, restricting or limiting the Company s and its subsidiaries  ability to, among other things: (i) make non-ordinary course dispositions of assets, (ii) make certain fundamental business changes, such as merge, consolidate or enter into any similar combination, (iii) make restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases, (iv) incur indebtedness, (v) make certain loans and investments, (vi) create liens, (vii) transact with affiliates, (viii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions, (ix) make negative pledges and (x) modify subordinated debt documents. 
  Under the 2016 Credit Agreement, restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases, shall be permitted if (i) the Company s leverage ratio is less than or equal to   2.50  , (ii) the Company is in compliance with all other financial covenants and (iii) there are no existing defaults under the 2016 Credit Agreement. If its leverage ratio is more than   2.50  , the Company is still permitted to fund (i) up to   $30.0 million   of dividend payments, (ii) stock repurchases sufficient to offset dilution created by the issuance of equity as compensation to its officer, directors, employees and consultants and (iii) an incremental   $30.0 million   of other cash payments. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Borrowers may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement and the commitments from the lenders may be terminated. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company s March 13, 2013 Credit Agreement (the  2013 Credit Agreement ), which provided the Company with a   $225.0 million   senior secured credit facility comprised of a   five  -year fully funded term loan of   $75.0 million   and a   five  -year   $150.0 million   revolving credit facility. 
  Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company was required to make quarterly installment payments against the   $75.0 million   term loan, with any remaining balance due on the maturity date of March 13, 2018. As a result of executing the 2016 Credit Agreement subsequent to   December 31, 2015  , but prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the year then ended, the   $6.9 million   current portion of term loan debt outstanding as of   December 31, 2015   was reflected as a component of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company was allowed to prepay the term loan in whole or in part prior to maturity without premium or penalty. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company repaid the remaining   $43.4 million   of principal outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement.  
  In the first quarter of 2016, approximately   $0.3 million   of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2013 Credit Agreement were written off in connection with executing the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Company incurred   $1.1 million   of debt issuance costs in connection with the execution of the 2016 Credit Agreement. Such fees have been deferred and are being amortized over the   five  -year term.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $64.7 million   of cash drawn and   $19.4 million   of undrawn letters of credit under the 2016 Credit Agreement, with   $240.9 million   of net availability for borrowings. As of   December 31, 2015  , there was   no   cash drawn and   $19.2 million   of undrawn letters of credit under the   $150.0 million   revolving credit facility portion of the 2013 Credit Agreement, with   $130.8 million   of net availability for borrowings. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   borrowings against the Company s non-U.S. lines of credit which provide for borrowings of up to   $0.2 million  . 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , gross borrowings and gross payments under the 2016 Credit Agreement were   $69.8 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , there were   no   gross borrowings or gross payments under the Company s domestic revolving credit facility portion of the 2013 Credit Agreement.

NOTE   6     INCOME TAXES 
  The Company recognized income tax expense of   $5.7 million   and   $8.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in tax expense in the current-year quarter is largely due to lower pre-tax income levels. The effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased to   43.2%  , compared to   35.0%   in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to additional valuation allowance being recorded in Canada.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company recorded gross deferred tax assets associated with its Canadian operations of   $4.7 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively, offset by a full valuation allowance. These assets primarily relate to Canadian net operating loss carryforwards that were largely generated by the discontinued North American refuse truck body business. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2026. As the Company is currently in a three-year cumulative loss position in Canada, inclusive of transitory purchase accounting expense effects associated with current-year acquisitions, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against these deferred tax assets. As such, the net deferred tax assets associated with the Company s Canadian operations are   zero   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Due to the current cumulative loss position in Canada, the Company continues to adjust its valuation allowance as deferred tax assets increase or decrease, which resulted in effectively no tax benefit being recorded on any Canadian losses in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . However, an income tax provision (or benefit) is still required in jurisdictions where the Company is not in a valuation allowance position, which is the case for the majority of the Company s operations, including the U.S. operations.  
  As a result of tax planning strategies, acquisitions or the generation of pre-tax profits, the Canadian deferred tax assets may be realized as part of the Company s continuing operations in future periods. Management has concluded that it is premature to release the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Canada in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily because of the aggregate year-to-date operating losses of current-year acquisitions. The current-year operating losses largely result from the recognition of higher cost of sales associated with sales of acquired equipment, which were increased to fair value in connection with purchase accounting for the acquisition of JJE. While these purchase accounting expense effects are expected to continue for several quarters, the impact on future quarterly operating results is expected to be less significant than in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . Management will continue to evaluate whether sufficient positive evidence exists to support the future realization of the Canadian deferred tax assets, such that some, or all, of the valuation allowance might be released in the fourth quarter of 2016, or in a subsequent period.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized income tax expense of   $16.2 million   and   $27.2 million  , respectively. The decrease in tax expense in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is largely due to lower pre-tax income levels. The effective tax rate was   37.2%   and   36.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  NOTE   7     PENSIONS 
  The following table summarizes the components of net postretirement pension expense:    

In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company contributed   $5.6 million   and   $5.5 million   to its U.S. defined benefit plan, respectively, and   $1.0 million   and   $1.1 million   to its non-U.S. defined benefit plan, respectively.  
  During the remainder of   2016  , the Company expects to make additional contributions of up to   $0.4 million   to the non-U.S. benefit plan but does not expect to make any further contributions to the U.S benefit plan.

In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased all of the remaining shares of its common stock from its U.S benefit plan for a total cost of   $3.6 million  . The repurchases were made under the stock repurchase program discussed further in Note   11     Stockholders  Equity.  
  In connection with the completion of the sale of Bronto, the Company recognized   $0.4 million   of actuarial losses in the first quarter of 2016, which were previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as a component of the calculation of the gain on disposal recorded in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
   
  NOTE   8     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Financial Commitments 
  The Company provides indemnifications and other guarantees in the ordinary course of business, the terms of which range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Specifically, the Company is occasionally required to provide letters of credit and bid and performance bonds to various customers, principally to act as security for retention levels related to casualty insurance policies and to guarantee the performance of subsidiaries that engage in export and domestic transactions. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding performance and financial standby letters of credit, as well as outstanding bid and performance bonds, aggregating   $23.7 million  . If any such letters of credit or bonds are called, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond. The Company believes the likelihood of any currently outstanding letter of credit or bond being called is remote.  
  In addition, prior to the   June 3, 2016   acquisition date, JJE entered into certain transactions involving the sale of equipment to certain of its customers which included (i) guarantees to repurchase the equipment for a fixed price at a future date and (ii) guarantees to repurchase the equipment from the third-party lender in the event of default by the customer. As of   September 30, 2016  , the single year and maximum potential cash payments the Company could be required to make to repurchase equipment under these agreements were   $1.5 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively. The Company s risk under these repurchase arrangements would be partially mitigated by the value of the products repurchased as part of the transaction. In addition, the former owners of JJE have agreed to reimburse the Company for certain losses incurred resulting from the requirement to repurchase any such equipment. Any such reimbursement would be withheld from the C  $8.0 million   deferred payment to be made on the third anniversary of the acquisition date. In the preliminary purchase price allocation, described further in Note   2     Acquisitions, the Company has included an immaterial accrual for potential losses related to the repurchase exposures associated with JJE s historical practices. The Company s repurchase accrual represents the expected losses that could result from obligations to repurchase products, after giving effect to proceeds anticipated to be received from the resale of those products to alternative customers, as well as to the reimbursement of any losses incurred. The Company has recorded its estimated net liability associated with losses from these guarantee and repurchase obligations on its Consolidated Balance Sheet based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant, but could increase if customer defaults exceed current expectations. 
  Product Warranties 
  The Company issues product performance warranties to customers with the sale of its products. The specific terms and conditions of these warranties vary depending upon the product sold and country in which the Company does business, with warranty periods generally ranging from   one   to   five   years. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the sale of the related product is recognized. Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include (i) the number of units under warranty, (ii) historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and (iii) costs per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. 
  The following table summarizes the changes in the Company s warranty liabilities:

Environmental Liabilities 
  Reserves of   $0.6 million   and   $0.9 million   related to the environmental remediation of the Pearland, Texas facility are included in liabilities of discontinued operations on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The facility was previously used by the Company s discontinued Pauluhn business and manufactured marine, offshore and industrial lighting products. The Company sold the facility in May 2012 and while the Company has not finalized its plans, it is probable that the site will require remediation. The recorded reserves are based on an undiscounted estimate of the range of costs to remediate the site, depending upon the remediation approach and other factors. The Company s estimate may change in the near-term as more information becomes available; however, the costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is subject to various claims, including pending and possible legal actions for product liability and other damages, and other matters arising in the ordinary course of the Company s business. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews uninsured material legal claims against the Company and accrues for the costs of such claims as appropriate in the exercise of management s best judgment and experience. However, due to a lack of factual information available to the Company about a claim, or the procedural stage of a claim, it may not be possible for the Company to reasonably assess either the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome of the claim or to reasonably estimate the amount of loss should there be an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, for many claims, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss. 
  The Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such claims and actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. 
  Hearing Loss Litigation 
  The Company has been sued for monetary damages by firefighters who claim that exposure to the Company s sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are therefore defective. There were   33   cases filed during the period of 1999 through 2004, involving a total of   2,443   plaintiffs, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. These cases involved more than   1,800   firefighter plaintiffs from locations outside of Chicago. In 2009,   six   additional cases were filed in Cook County, involving   299   Pennsylvania firefighter plaintiffs. During 2013, another case was filed in Cook County involving   74   Pennsylvania firefighter plaintiffs. 
  The trial of the first   27   of these plaintiffs  claims occurred in 2008, whereby a Cook County jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the Company. 
  An additional   40   Chicago firefighter plaintiffs were selected for trial in 2009. Plaintiffs  counsel later moved to reduce the number of plaintiffs from   40   to   nine  . The trial for these   nine   plaintiffs concluded with a verdict against the Company and for the plaintiffs in varying amounts totaling   $0.4 million  . The Company appealed this verdict. On September 13, 2012, the Illinois Appellate Court rejected this appeal. The Company thereafter filed a petition for rehearing with the Illinois Appellate Court, which was denied on February 7, 2013. The Company sought further review by filing a petition for leave to appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court on March 14, 2013. On May 29, 2013, the Illinois Supreme Court issued a summary order declining to accept review of this case. On July 1, 2013, the Company satisfied the judgments entered for these plaintiffs, which has resulted in final dismissal of these cases. 
  A third consolidated trial involving   eight   Chicago firefighter plaintiffs occurred during November 2011. The jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the Company at the conclusion of this trial. 
  Following this trial, on March 12, 2012 the trial court entered an order certifying a class of the remaining Chicago Fire Department firefighter plaintiffs for trial on the sole issue of whether the Company s sirens were defective and unreasonably dangerous. The Company petitioned the Illinois Appellate Court for interlocutory appeal of this ruling. On May 17, 2012, the Illinois Appellate Court accepted the Company s petition. On June 8, 2012, plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal, agreeing with the Company that the trial court had erred in certifying a class action trial in this matter. Pursuant to plaintiffs  motion, the Illinois Appellate Court reversed the trial court s certification order. 
  Thereafter, the trial court scheduled a fourth consolidated trial involving   three   firefighter plaintiffs, which began in December 2012. Prior to the start of this trial, the claims of   two   of the   three   firefighter plaintiffs were dismissed. On December 17, 2012,

the jury entered a complete defense verdict for the Company. 
  Following this defense verdict, plaintiffs again moved to certify a class of Chicago Fire Department plaintiffs for trial on the sole issue of whether the Company s sirens were defective and unreasonably dangerous. Over the Company s objection, the trial court granted plaintiffs  motion for class certification on March 11, 2013 and scheduled a class action trial to begin on June 10, 2013. The Company filed a petition for review with the Illinois Appellate Court on March 29, 2013 seeking reversal of the class certification order.  
  On June 25, 2014, a unanimous three-judge panel of the First District Illinois Appellate Court issued its opinion reversing the class certification order of the trial court. Specifically, the Appellate Court determined that the trial court s ruling failed to satisfy the class-action requirements that the common issues of the firefighters  claims predominate over the individual issues and that there is an adequate representative for the class. During a status hearing on October 8, 2014, plaintiffs represented to the Court that they would again seek to certify a class of firefighters on the issue of whether the Company s sirens were defective and unreasonably dangerous. On January 12, 2015, plaintiffs filed motions to amend their complaints to add class action allegations with respect to Chicago firefighter plaintiffs as well as the approximately   1,800   firefighter plaintiffs from locations outside of Chicago. On March 11, 2015, the trial court granted plaintiff s motions to amend their complaints. Plaintiffs have indicated that they will now file motions to certify classes in these cases. On April 24, 2015, the cases were transferred to Cook County chancery court, which will decide all class certification issues. The Company intends to continue its objections to any attempt at certification. The Company also has filed motions to dismiss cases involving firefighters located outside of Cook County based on improper venue. Plaintiffs have requested discovery from the Company related to these venue motions. The Court has scheduled oral argument on these venue motions for December 5, 2016. 
  The Company has also been sued on this issue outside of the Cook County, Illinois venue. Many of these cases have involved lawsuits filed by a single attorney in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. During 2007 and through 2009, this attorney filed a total of   71   lawsuits involving   71   plaintiffs in this jurisdiction.   Three   of these cases were dismissed pursuant to pretrial motions filed by the Company. Another case was voluntarily dismissed. Prior to trial in   four   cases, the Company paid nominal sums to obtain dismissals. 
  Three   trials occurred in Philadelphia involving these cases filed in 2007 through 2009. The first trial involving one of these plaintiffs occurred in 2010, when the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. In particular, the jury found that the Company s siren was not defectively designed, but that the Company negligently constructed the siren. The jury awarded damages in the amount of   $0.1 million  , which was subsequently reduced to   $0.08 million  . The Company appealed this verdict. Another trial, involving   nine   Philadelphia firefighter plaintiffs, also occurred in 2010 when the jury returned a defense verdict for the Company as to all claims and all plaintiffs involved in that trial. The third trial, also involving   nine   Philadelphia firefighter plaintiffs, was completed during 2010 when the jury returned a defense verdict for the Company as to all claims and all plaintiffs involved in that trial. 
  Following defense verdicts in the last two Philadelphia trials, the Company negotiated settlements with respect to all remaining filed cases in Philadelphia at that time, as well as other firefighter claimants represented by the attorney who filed the Philadelphia cases. On January 4, 2011, the Company entered into a Global Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with the law firm of the attorney representing the Philadelphia claimants, on behalf of   1,125   claimants the firm represented (the  Claimants ) and who had asserted product claims against the Company (the  Claims ).   Three hundred eight   of the Claimants had lawsuits pending against the Company in Cook County, Illinois. 
  The Settlement Agreement, as amended, provided that the Company pay a total amount of   $3.8 million   (the  Settlement Payment ) to settle the Claims (including the costs, fees and other expenses of the law firm in connection with its representation of the Claimants), subject to certain terms, conditions and procedures set forth in the Settlement Agreement. In order for the Company to be required to make the Settlement Payment: (i) each Claimant who agreed to settle his or her claims had to sign a release acceptable to the Company (a  Release ), (ii) each Claimant who agreed to the settlement and who was a plaintiff in a lawsuit, had to dismiss his or her lawsuit with prejudice, (iii) by April 29, 2011, at least   93%   of the Claimants identified in the Settlement Agreement must have agreed to settle their claims and provide a signed Release to the Company and (iv) the law firm had to withdraw from representing any Claimants who did not agree to the settlement, including those who filed lawsuits. If the conditions to the settlement were met, but less than   100%   of the Claimants agreed to settle their Claims and sign a Release, the Settlement Payment would be reduced by the percentage of Claimants who did not agree to the settlement. 
  On April 22, 2011, the Company confirmed that the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement had been met and made a payment of   $3.6 million   to conclude the settlement. The amount was based upon the Company s receipt of   1,069   signed releases provided by Claimants, which was   95.02%   of all Claimants identified in the Settlement Agreement.

The Company generally denies the allegations made in the claims and lawsuits by the Claimants and denies that its products caused any injuries to the Claimants. Nonetheless, the Company entered into the Settlement Agreement for the purpose of minimizing its expenses, including legal fees, and avoiding the inconvenience, uncertainty and distraction of the claims and lawsuits. 
  During April through October 2012,   20   new cases were filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. These cases were filed on behalf of   20   Philadelphia firefighters and involve various defendants in addition to the Company.   Five   of these cases were subsequently dismissed. The first trial involving these 2012 Philadelphia cases occurred during December 2014 and involved   three   firefighter plaintiffs. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company. Following this trial, all of the parties agreed to settle cases involving   seven   firefighter plaintiffs set for trial during January 2015 for nominal amounts per plaintiff. In January 2015, plaintiffs  attorneys filed   two   new complaints in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on behalf of approximately   70   additional firefighter plaintiffs. The vast majority of the firefighters identified in these complaints are located outside of Pennsylvania.   One   of the complaints in these cases, which involves   11   firefighter plaintiffs from the District of Columbia, was removed to federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims in this case on May 31, 2016. With respect to claims of other out-of-state firefighters involved in these two cases, the Company moved to dismiss these claims as improperly filed in Pennsylvania. The Court granted this motion and dismissed these claims on November 5, 2015. During August through December 2015, another   nine   new cases were filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. These cases involve a total of   193   firefighters, most of whom are located outside of Pennsylvania. The Company again moved to dismiss all claims filed by out-of-state firefighters in these cases as improperly filed in Pennsylvania. On May 24, 2016, the Court granted this motion and dismissed these claims. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal regarding this decision. On May 13, 2016,   four   new cases were filed in Philadelphia state court, involving a total of   55   Philadelphia firefighters who live in Pennsylvania. During August 2016, the Company settled a case involving   four   Philadelphia firefighters that had been set for trial in Philadelphia state court during September 2016. 
  During April through July 2013, additional cases were filed in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. These cases involve   247   plaintiff firefighters from Pittsburgh and various defendants, including the Company. After the Company filed pretrial motions, the Court dismissed claims of   55   Pittsburgh firefighter plaintiffs. The first trials of these Pittsburgh firefighters were scheduled to occur in May, September and November 2016. Each trial will involve   eight   firefighters. On April 14, 2016, the Court granted the Company s motion for summary judgment regarding strict liability claims asserted by all plaintiff firefighters involved in the initial trial scheduled for May 2016. The Company also has moved to dismiss remaining negligence claims asserted by these firefighters. It is anticipated that the Court will rule on this motion sometime during 2016. The next trial involving   six   Pittsburgh firefighters has been scheduled to start on November 7, 2016. During March 2014, an action also was brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Pennsylvania on behalf of   61   firefighters. This case likewise involves various defendants in addition to the Company. After the Company filed pretrial motions,   33   Erie County firefighter plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims.  
  On September 17, 2014,   20   lawsuits, involving a total of   193   Buffalo Fire Department firefighters, were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Erie County. Several product manufacturers, including the Company, have been named as defendants in these cases. All of the cases filed in Erie County, New York have been removed to federal court in the Western District of New York. During February 2015, a lawsuit involving   one   New York City firefighter plaintiff was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. The plaintiff named the Company as well as several other parties as defendants. That case has been transferred to federal court in the Northern District of New York. Plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss this case during May 2016. The Company also is aware that a lawsuit involving   eight   New York City firefighters was filed in New York County, New York, on April 24, 2015. The Company has not yet been served in that case. During November 2015 through January 2016,   28   new cases involving a total of   227   firefighters were filed in various counties in the New York City area. A total of   428   firefighters are currently involved in cases filed in the state of New York.  
  During November 2015, the Company was served with a complaint filed in Union County, New Jersey state court, involving   34   New Jersey firefighters. This case has been transferred to federal court in the District of New Jersey. During the period from January through May 2016,   eight   additional cases were filed in various New Jersey state courts. Most of the firefighters in these cases reside in New Jersey and work or worked at New Jersey fire departments. A total of   104   firefighters are currently involved in cases filed in New Jersey.   
  From 2007 through 2009, firefighters also brought hearing loss claims against the Company in New Jersey, Missouri, Maryland and Kings County, New York. All of those cases, however, were dismissed prior to trial, including   four   cases in the Supreme Court of Kings County, New York that were dismissed upon the Company s motion in 2008. On appeal, the New York appellate

court affirmed the trial court s dismissal of these cases. Plaintiffs  attorneys have threatened to file additional lawsuits. The Company intends to vigorously defend all of these lawsuits, if filed. 
  The Company s ongoing negotiations with its insurer, CNA, over insurance coverage on these claims have resulted in reimbursements of a portion of the Company s defense costs. These reimbursements are recorded as a reduction of corporate operating expenses. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded $  0.2 million   and   $0.2 million   of reimbursements from CNA related to legal costs, respectively.  
  Latvian Commercial Dispute 
  On June 12, 2014, a Latvian trial court issued a summary ruling against the Company s former Bronto subsidiary in a lawsuit relating to a commercial dispute. The dispute involves a transaction for the 2008 sale of   three   Bronto units that were purchased by a financing company for lease to a Latvian fire department. The lessor and the Latvian fire department sought to rescind the contract after delivery, despite the fact that an independent third party, selected by the lessor, had certified that the vehicles satisfied the terms of the contract. The adverse judgment required Bronto to refund the purchase price and pay interest and attorneys  fees. The trial court denied the lessor s claim against Bronto for alleged damages relating to lost lease income.  
  Believing that the claims against Bronto were invalid and that Bronto fully satisfied the terms of the subject contract, on July 10, 2014, the Company filed an appeal with the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Latvia seeking a reversal of the trial court s ruling.  
  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had not accrued any liability within its consolidated financial statements for this lawsuit. In evaluating whether a charge to record a reserve was previously necessary, the Company analyzed all of the available information, including the legal reasoning applied by the judge of the trial court in reaching its decision. Based on the Company s analysis, and consultations with external counsel, the Company assessed the likelihood of a successful appeal to be more likely than not and therefore did not believe that a probable loss had been incurred. 
  In connection with the sale of Bronto to Morita Holdings Corporation ( Morita ), discussed further in Note   15     Discontinued Operations, the Company and Morita agreed that the Company would remain in control of negotiations and proceedings relating to the appeal and fund the legal costs associated therewith. The Company also agreed to compensate Morita for   50%   of any liability resulting from a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, net of any actual income tax benefit to Bronto as a result of the judgment, and less   50%   of legal fees incurred by the Company, relating to the defense of this matter, subsequent to the   January 29, 2016   closing date of the sale.  
  In April 2016, the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Latvia heard the Company s appeal and upheld the trial court s ruling against Bronto. As the Company s appeal of the trial judgment was unsuccessful, a charge of   $1.5 million   was recorded as a component of   Gain from discontinued operations and disposal, net of tax   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , to reflect the Company s share of the liability. The Company has decided not to further appeal the Supreme Court s ruling and expects to pay the aforementioned compensation to Morita during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
   
  NOTE   9     EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  The Company computes earnings per share ( EPS ) in accordance with ASC 260,   Earnings per Share  , which requires that non-vested restricted stock containing non-forfeitable dividend rights should be treated as participating securities pursuant to the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is reduced by the amount of dividends declared in the period for common stock and participating securities. The remaining undistributed earnings are then allocated to common stock and participating securities as if all of the net income for the period had been distributed. The amounts of distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were insignificant and did not materially impact the calculation of basic or diluted EPS. 
  Basic EPS is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and non-vested restricted stock awards outstanding for the period.  
  Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and non-vested restricted stock awards outstanding for the year plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of common stock equivalents is determined using the more dilutive of the two-class method or alternative methods. The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the potentially dilutive impact of our employee stock options and restricted stock units, and the contingently issuable method for our performance-based restricted stock unit awards.

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , options to purchase   1.3 million   shares of the Company s common stock had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , options to purchase   0.8 million   shares of the Company s common stock had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.  
  The following table reconciles   Net income   to basic and diluted EPS: 

NOTE   10     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  On   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , performance share units ( PSUs ) granted in 2013 and 2012, respectively, became fully vested. The EPS threshold associated with each of these awards was achieved at the maximum level, and   200%   of the target shares were earned. In addition, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , various restricted stock awards granted in 2013 and 2012, respectively, became fully vested. These vested PSUs and restricted stock awards were net share settled. In connection with the issuance of the shares underlying these PSUs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and with the vesting of restricted stock, the Company transferred   0.2 million   and   0.2 million   shares, respectively, into Treasury stock, based upon the Company s closing stock price on the vesting date, to satisfy the employees  minimum statutory withholding obligation for applicable income and other employment taxes. The Company then remitted the equivalent cash value to the appropriate taxing authorities.  
  Total payments for the employees  tax obligations to the relevant taxing authorities were   $2.6 million   and   $3.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

  Stock Repurchase Program 
  In April 2014, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program (the  April 2014 program ) of up to   $15.0 million   of the Company s common stock. The April 2014 program was intended primarily to facilitate a reduction in the investment in Company stock within the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plan portfolio and to reduce dilution resulting from issuances of stock under the Company s employee equity incentive programs.  
  In November 2014, the Board authorized an additional stock repurchase program (the  November 2014 program ) of up to   $75.0 million   of the Company s common stock. The November 2014 program is intended primarily to facilitate opportunistic purchases of Company stock as a means to provide cash returns to stockholders, enhance stockholder returns and manage the Company s capital structure.  
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased   394,430   and   724,792   shares for a total of   $5.6 million   and   $10.6 million  , respectively, under the authorized stock repurchase programs. During the second quarter of 2015, cumulative stock repurchases under the April 2014 program reached the maximum authorized level of   $15.0 million  . Since that time, no additional stock repurchases have been, or will be, made under that program.  
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   50,882   and   2,631,607   shares for a total of   $0.7 million   and   $33.8 million  , respectively, under the November 2014 program.  
  Under its stock repurchase programs, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Stock repurchases by the Company are subject to market conditions and other factors and may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time.

  NOTE   12     SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  The Company has   two   operating segments as defined under ASC Topic 280  ,     Segment Reporting   ( ASC 280 )  .   The Company s reportable segments are consistent with its operating segments.

  Corporate contains those items that are not included in our operating segments. 
  Net sales by operating segment reflect sales of products and services to external customers, as reported in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intersegment sales are insignificant. The Company evaluates performance based on operating income of the respective segment. Operating income includes all revenues, costs and expenses directly related to the segment involved. In determining operating segment income, neither corporate nor interest expenses are included.

Corporate assets consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and fixed assets. The accounting policies of each operating segment are the same as those described in Note   1     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , in addition to those updates described in Note   1     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q.

NOTE   14     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s assumptions about valuation based on the best information available in the circumstances. The three levels of inputs are classified as follows:  
             
    Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
                
    Level 2   observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and  
                
    Level 3   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 
     In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches within the fair value measurement framework. The valuation methodologies used for the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy are summarized below: 
  Cash Equivalents 
  Cash equivalents primarily consist of time-based deposits and interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less. The Company classified cash equivalents as Level 1 due to the short-term nature of these instruments and measured the fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
  Contingent Consideration 
  The Company has a contingent obligation to transfer cash to the former owners of JJE if specified financial results are met over future reporting periods (i.e., an earn-out). Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured at fair value each reporting period, with the acquisition-date fair value included as part of the consideration transferred. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of   Acquisition and integration related expenses   on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The Company uses an income approach to value the contingent consideration obligation based on future financial performance, which is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Due to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs, the Company has classified the contingent consideration liability within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy outlined in ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements  . Increases in the expected payout under a contingent consideration arrangement contribute to increases in the fair value of the related liability. Conversely, decreases in the expected payout under a contingent consideration arrangement contribute to decreases in the fair value of the related liability. Changes in assumptions could have an impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration, which has a maximum payout of C  $10.0 million   (approximately   $7.6 million  ).

  NOTE   15     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
  The Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of   $1.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily related to adjustments of uncertain tax position reserves following the expiration of statute of limitations.  
  In the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company received the last remaining   $4.0 million   of escrow funds from the 2012 sale of the former Federal Signal Technologies Group. This income was recorded, net of $1.6 million of tax expense, as a component of   Gain from discontinued operations and disposal, net of tax   within its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Also contributing to the   $3.0 million   net gain from discontinued operations and disposal reported in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was   $0.6 million   of net income generated by the operations of the Fire Rescue Group. 
  The Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of   $3.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by the   $4.0 million   net gain on disposal of the Fire Rescue Group, which was discontinued in 2015, partially offset by the   $0.6 million   net loss that the Fire Rescue Group realized in its   2016   operations up to the   January 29, 2016   sale completion date. The net gain on disposal includes a   $1.5 million   charge to recognize a liability in connection with a Latvian commercial dispute. Also contributing to the net gain in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a reduction in uncertain tax position reserves of approximately   $1.0 million  .  
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of   $3.6 million  , primarily driven by   $1.2 million   of net income generated by the operations of the Fire Rescue Group, as well as the aforementioned net income associated with the receipt of the escrow funds. 
  The activity of the Company s discontinued operations in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is described further below: 
  Fire Rescue Group 
  On   January 29, 2016  , the Company completed the sale of Bronto to Morita, initially receiving proceeds of    76 million   in cash at closing (approximately   $82.3 million  ), with an additional    5.1 million   in cash (approximately   $5.7 million  ) being received in connection with the payment of the final working capital and net debt adjustments in the second quarter of   2016  .

Prior to sale, Bronto was the only remaining operation in the Company s Fire Rescue Group, which was previously identified as an operating segment of the Company as defined under ASC 280. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company will no longer operate the Fire Rescue Group, which the Company considers a significant strategic shift in the Company s operations. The Fire Rescue Group is being presented as a discontinued operation in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Under the terms of the sale, the Company and Morita agreed that the Company will remain in control of negotiations and proceedings relating to the appeal of the ruling issued in the Latvian commercial dispute, discussed further in Note   8     Commitments and Contingencies, and also fund the legal costs associated therewith. The Company also agreed to compensate Morita for   50%   of any liability resulting from a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, net of any actual income tax benefit to Bronto as a result of the judgment, and less   50%   of legal fees incurred by the Company between the   January 29, 2016   date of sale and the date of receiving such non-appealable decision. The Company s appeal of the initial judgment, heard in April 2016, was unsuccessful, and a charge of   $1.5 million   was recorded as a component of   Gain from discontinued operations and disposal, net of tax   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to reflect the Company s share of the liability. The Company has decided not to further appeal the Supreme Court s ruling and expects to pay the aforementioned compensation to Morita during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  On   December 16, 2015  , the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional contract value of    76.0 million   to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure related to the receipt of the euro-denominated sales proceeds. Prior to its settlement on   January 29, 2016  , the derivative was being marked-to-market, with related gains or losses reported in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The forward contract had a fair value of   $0.9 million   on settlement, and a gain of   $0.3 million   was recorded as a component of Other (income) expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The forward contract had a fair value of   $0.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . An asset of   $0.6 million   was included as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of the forward contract was determined using readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments (Level 2 input).  
  In accordance with ASC 740, a tax liability should be recognized for the excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis (or the tax benefit when the tax basis exceeds the financial reporting basis) of an investment in a subsidiary (outside basis difference) when it is apparent that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. In connection with presenting the Fire Rescue Group as a discontinued operation as of   December 31, 2015  , the Company was required to re-evaluate its position related to the recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for the outside basis differences of the Bronto entities being sold to Morita. In prior years, deferred taxes for such outside basis differences had not been recognized, either because of the Company s assertion of permanent reinvestment, or because recognition was not required applying one of the exceptions provided for in ASC 740. Due to the pending sale, these exceptions no longer applied at   December 31, 2015  , as the outside basis differences were expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. As a result, a net deferred tax liability of   $6.3 million   was recorded as a component of long-term liabilities of discontinued operations on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015  . Upon completion of the sale in the first quarter of 2016, this net deferred tax liability was recognized as a component of the tax expense on the gain on disposal.  
  After recognition of the accumulated foreign currency translation loss attributable to the Fire Rescue Group, as described in Note   11     Stockholders  Equity, the actuarial losses described in Note   7     Pensions, the   $1.5 million   liability recorded in connection with the Latvian commercial dispute, as well as   $4.6 million   of net income tax expense, the Company recognized a net gain of   $4.0 million   on disposal of the Fire Rescue Group upon completion of the sale in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Item 2.  
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is designed to provide information that is supplemental to, and should be read together with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Form 10-Q, as well as the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended December 31, 2015  . Information in MD A is intended to assist the reader in obtaining an understanding of (i) the condensed consolidated financial statements, (ii) the Company s business segments and how the results of those segments impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition as a whole and (iii) how certain accounting principles affect the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company s results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual operating results. 
   
  Executive Summary 
  The Company is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of (i) sewer cleaners, vacuum trucks, street sweepers and other environmental vehicles and equipment and (ii) safety, security and communication equipment. We also are a designer and supplier of technology-based products and services for the public safety market. In addition, we sell parts and provide service, repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a comprehensive offering to our customer base. We operate nine manufacturing facilities in four countries around the world and provide products and integrated solutions to municipal, governmental, industrial and commercial customers in all regions of the world.  
  As described in Note   12     Segment Information to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company s business units are organized and managed in two operating segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group.  
  On   June 3, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of JJE. The Company expects that JJE will facilitate sales of its existing products into new markets, expand the Company s product and service offerings and increase the Company s footprint across North America. With the acquisition of JJE, the Company s product offerings has expanded to include other products, including those not manufactured by the Company, including refuse and recycling collection vehicles, camera systems, ice-making equipment and snow-removal equipment.  
  Net sales increased by   $7.0 million  , or   4%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year quarter. Our Environmental Solutions Group reported a net sales increase of   $11.3 million  , or   9%  , largely due to $31.0 million of incremental net sales resulting from the JJE acquisition, largely offset by lower shipments of vacuum trucks and street sweepers in the U.S. and reduced international sales of street sweepers and sewer cleaners. Within our Safety and Security Systems Group, net sales decreased by   $4.3 million  , or   8%  , largely due to lower sales into global industrial markets, partially offset by improved sales into U.S. public safety markets. Net sales in our Safety and Security Systems Group in the prior-year period also benefited from the receipt of a large order cancellation fee. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net sales decreased by   $49.8 million  , or   9%  , largely due to a   $40.7 million   net sales decrease within our Environmental Solutions Group, resulting from lower sales of vacuum trucks and street sweepers in the U.S, as well as fewer international shipments of street sweepers and sewer cleaners. Largely offsetting these reductions were $35.0 million of incremental net sales resulting from the JJE acquisition. In the Safety and Security Systems Group, net sales decreased by   $9.1 million  , or   5%  , primarily due to lower sales into global industrial markets, partially offset by improved sales into domestic public safety markets. 
  Operating income decreased by   $11.7 million  , or   46%  , to   $13.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by a   $9.0 million   decline within our Environmental Solutions Group associated with changes in sales mix, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher percentage of sales of products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin, as well as negative operating leverage, additional operating expenses incurred in support of current-year acquisitions, the inclusion of   $2.5 million   of expense relating to JJE purchase accounting effects and   $0.3 million   of acquisition-related expenses. Also contributing to the lower operating income in the current-year quarter was a   $2.8 million   decrease in operating income within our Safety and Security Systems Group, inclusive of a   $0.4 million   restructuring charge. In the prior-year period, our Safety and Security Systems Group s operating income benefited from the receipt of the $1.8 million order cancellation fee. Consolidated operating margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , inclusive of purchase accounting effects, restructuring charges and acquisition costs, was   7.2%  , down from   14.0%   in the prior year.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , operating income decreased by   $35.0 million  , or   44%  , primarily driven by a   $30.7 million   reduction within our Environmental Solutions Group, associated with negative operating leverage resulting from lower sales volumes, unfavorable sales mix effects, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher percentage of sales of products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin, as well as additional operating expenses

incurred in support of current-year acquisitions, the inclusion of   $3.0 million   of expense relating to JJE purchase accounting effects and   $0.3 million   of acquisition-related expenses. Also contributing to the lower operating income in the current-year quarter was a   $5.2 million   decrease in operating income within our Safety and Security Systems Group, inclusive of a   $1.2 million   increase in restructuring expenses. Partially offsetting the operating income reductions in each of our groups was a   $0.9 million   reduction in Corporate operating expenses, in spite of a   $0.9 million   increase in expenses associated with acquisition and integration-related activity. Consolidated operating margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , inclusive of the aforementioned purchase accounting effects, restructuring charges and acquisition costs, was   8.3%  , down from   13.6%   in the prior year. 
  Income before income taxes decreased by   $11.1 million  , or   46%  , to   $13.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year quarter. The decrease resulted from the reduced operating income, partially offset by a   $0.6 million   favorable change in other (income) expense.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , income before income taxes decreased by   $32.1 million   as compared to the prior-year period. The decrease resulted from the reduced operating income, as well as a   $0.3 million   write-off of deferred financing fees resulting from the debt refinancing completed in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , partially offset by a   $2.8 million   favorable change in other (income) expense, net and a   $0.4 million   reduction in interest expense.  
  Net income from continuing operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   also benefited from reductions in income tax expense of   $2.8 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively, largely due to lower pre-tax income levels. The effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   43.2%  , compared to   35.0%   in the prior-year quarter. The effective tax rate was   37.2%   and   36.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Total orders for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased by   $17.9 million  , or   11%  , compared to the prior-year quarter. Orders in our Environmental Solutions Group increased by   $27.5 million  , mostly due to increased Canadian orders following the acquisition of JJE in the second quarter of 2016. Orders in our Safety and Security Systems Group were down   $9.6 million  , primarily due to lower orders from public safety markets, as well as reduced orders from industrial markets.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , total orders increased by   $2.3 million   as compared to the prior-year period, largely due to a   $25.5 million   improvement in orders within our Environmental Solutions Group that was largely offset by a   $23.2 million   order reduction in the Safety and Security Systems Group. Within our Environmental Solutions Group, increased orders from Canada, inclusive of orders acquired in, and received subsequent to, the JJE acquisition, were largely offset by reduced domestic orders for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners, street sweepers and waterblasting equipment. The decrease in orders within our Safety and Security Systems Group was primarily due to lower orders from global industrial markets, reflective of reduced demand from oil and gas markets. 
  Our consolidated backlog at   September 30, 2016   was   $148.7 million  , about even with the second quarter of 2016, but down   $30.6 million  , from   $179.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  .

Results of Operations 
  The following table summarizes our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and illustrates the key financial indicators used to assess our consolidated financial results:    

Net sales    
  Net sales increased by   $7.0 million  , or   4%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year quarter. The Environmental Solutions Group reported a net sales increase of   $11.3 million  , or   9%  , largely due to $31.0 million of incremental net sales resulting from the JJE acquisition, largely offset by lower shipments of vacuum trucks and street sweepers in the U.S. and reduced international sales of street sweepers and sewer cleaners. In the Safety and Security Systems Group, net sales decreased by   $4.3 million  , or   8%  , largely due to lower sales into global industrial markets, partially offset by improved sales into U.S. public safety markets. Net sales in the Safety and Security Systems Group in the prior-year period also benefited from the receipt of an order cancellation fee of approximately $1.8 million. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net sales decreased by   $49.8 million  , or   9%  , largely due to a   $40.7 million   net sales decrease within the Environmental Solutions Group, resulting from lower sales of vacuum trucks and street sweepers in the U.S, as well as fewer international shipments of street sweepers and sewer cleaners. Largely offsetting these reductions were $35.0 million of incremental net sales resulting from the JJE acquisition. In the Safety and Security Systems Group, net sales decreased by   $9.1 million  , or   5%  , primarily due to lower sales into global industrial markets, partially offset by improved sales into domestic public safety markets. 
  Cost of sales    
  Cost of sales increased by   $16.4 million  , or   13%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year quarter, largely due to an increase of   $17.9 million  , or   20%  , within the Environmental Solutions Group, primarily driven by increased sales volumes, as well as the recognition of approximately   $2.5 million   of expense associated with purchase

accounting effects, associated with the JJE acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales of   $1.5 million  , or   4%  , within the Safety and Security Systems Group, largely driven by lower sales volume.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cost of sales decreased by   $17.2 million  , or   4%  , largely due to a decrease of   $13.6 million  , or   4%  , within the Environmental Solutions Group. The reduction was primarily driven by lower sales of vacuum trucks and street sweepers in the U.S, as well as fewer international shipments of street sweepers and sewer cleaners, partially offset by unfavorable mix effects and the recognition of the approximately   $3.0 million   of expense associated with purchase accounting effects resulting from the acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales of   $3.6 million  , or   3%  , within the Safety and Security Systems Group, largely driven by lower sales volume.  
  Gross profit    
  Gross profit decreased by   $9.4 million  , or   17%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior-year quarter, consisting of reductions within the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group of   $6.6 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively. Gross margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased to   24.3%  , from   30.4%   in the prior-year quarter, largely due to purchase accounting expense effects, reduced operating leverage, with lower absorption of manufacturing costs, as well as unfavorable sales mix, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher percentage of sales of products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin, within the Environmental Solutions Group. In addition, gross margin in the prior-year quarter included the effects of receiving a large order cancellation fee within the Safety and Security Systems Group.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , gross profit decreased by   $32.6 million  , or   19%  , consisting of reductions within the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group of   $27.1 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively. Gross margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased to   25.9%  , from   29.3%   in the prior-year quarter, largely due to purchase accounting expense effects, reduced operating leverage due to lower volumes, as well as unfavorable sales mix, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher concentration of sales of products manufactured by other companies, within the Environmental Solutions Group. In addition, gross margin in the prior-year period included the effects of receiving a large order cancellation fee within the Safety and Security Systems Group.  
  Selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses    
  Selling, engineering, general and administrative ( SEG A ) expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased by   $1.6 million  , or   5%  , compared to the prior-year quarter, largely due to a   $2.1 million   increase within the Environmental Solutions Group, partially offset by decreases of   $0.4 million   and   $0.1 million   within the Safety and Security Systems Group and Corporate, respectively. The increase in SEG A expenses within the Environmental Solutions Group was largely the result of the addition of expenses of businesses acquired in the current year, whereas the reductions within the Safety and Security Systems Group and Corporate primarily related to lower employee costs.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , SEG A expenses were flat, with decreases of   $1.8 million   and   $1.5 million   within Corporate and the Safety and Security Systems Group, respectively, being offset by a   $3.3 million   increase within the Environmental Solutions Group. The decreases in SEG A expenses within the Safety and Security Systems Group and Corporate were inclusive of lower employee costs, whereas the increase in SEG A expenses within the Environmental Solutions Group was largely the result of the addition of expenses of businesses acquired in the current year.  
  Operating income    
  Operating income decreased by   $11.7 million  , or   46%  , to   $13.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by a   $9.0 million   decline within the Environmental Solutions Group associated with changes in sales mix, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher percentage of sales of products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin, as well as negative operating leverage, additional operating expenses incurred in support of current-year acquisitions, the inclusion of   $2.5 million   of expense relating to JJE purchase accounting effects and   $0.3 million   of acquisition-related expenses. Also contributing to the lower operating income in the current-year quarter was a   $2.8 million   decrease in operating income within the Safety and Security Systems Group, inclusive of a   $0.4 million   restructuring charge. In the prior-year period, the Safety and Security Systems Group s operating income benefited from the receipt of the $1.8 million order cancellation fee. Consolidated operating margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , inclusive of purchase accounting effects, restructuring charges and acquisition costs, was   7.2%  , down from   14.0%   in the prior year.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , operating income decreased by   $35.0 million  , or   44%  , primarily driven by a   $30.7 million   reduction within the Environmental Solutions Group, associated with negative operating leverage resulting from lower sales volumes, unfavorable sales mix effects, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher percentage of sales of

products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin, as well as additional operating expenses incurred in support of current-year acquisitions, the inclusion of   $3.0 million   of expense relating to JJE purchase accounting effects and   $0.3 million   of acquisition-related expenses. Also contributing to the lower operating income in the current-year quarter was a   $5.2 million   decrease in operating income within the Safety and Security Systems Group, inclusive of a   $1.2 million   increase in restructuring expenses. Partially offsetting the operating income reductions in each of our groups was a   $0.9 million   reduction in Corporate operating expenses, in spite of a   $0.9 million   increase in expenses associated with acquisition and integration-related activity. Consolidated operating margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , inclusive of the aforementioned purchase accounting effects, restructuring charges and acquisition costs, was   8.3%  , down from   13.6%   in the prior year. 
  Interest expense    
  Interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was flat when compared to the same period of the prior year. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , interest expense decreased by   $0.4 million  , largely due to reductions in the average debt levels in the respective periods.  
  Other (income) expense, net    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , other (income) expense, net, totaled   $0.3 million   of income, and largely related to interest income on a loan provided to a customer, whereas for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $0.3 million   of expense was reported, represented primarily by realized losses from foreign currency transactions. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , other (income) expense, net, totaled   $1.3 million   of income, and largely related to a gain on the settlement of a foreign currency forward contract and interest income on a loan provided to a customer, whereas for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $1.5 million   of expense was reported, represented primarily by realized losses from foreign currency transactions. 
  Income tax expense    
  The Company recognized income tax expense of   $5.7 million   and   $8.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in tax expense in the current-year quarter is largely due to lower pre-tax income levels. The effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased to   43.2%  , compared to   35.0%   in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to additional valuation allowance being recorded in Canada.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company recorded gross deferred tax assets associated with its Canadian operations of   $4.7 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively, offset by a full valuation allowance. These assets primarily relate to Canadian net operating loss carryforwards that were largely generated by the discontinued North American refuse truck body business. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2026. As the Company is currently in a three-year cumulative loss position in Canada, inclusive of transitory purchase accounting expense effects associated with current-year acquisitions, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against these deferred tax assets. As such, the net deferred tax assets associated with the Company s Canadian operations are   zero   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Due to the current cumulative loss position in Canada, the Company continues to adjust its valuation allowance as deferred tax assets increase or decrease, which resulted in effectively no tax benefit being recorded on any Canadian losses in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  However, an income tax provision (or benefit) is still required in jurisdictions where the Company is not in a valuation allowance position, which is the case for the majority of the Company s operations, including the U.S. operations.  
  As a result of tax planning strategies, acquisitions or the generation of pre-tax profits, the Canadian deferred tax assets may be realized as part of the Company s continuing operations in future periods. Management has concluded that it is premature to release the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Canada in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily because of the aggregate year-to-date operating losses of current-year acquisitions. The current-year operating losses largely result from the recognition of higher cost of sales associated with sales of acquired equipment, which were increased to fair value in connection with purchase accounting for the acquisition of JJE. While these purchase accounting expense effects are expected to continue for several quarters, the impact on future quarterly operating results is expected to be less significant than in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . Management will continue to evaluate whether sufficient positive evidence exists to support the future realization of the Canadian deferred tax assets, such that some, or all, of the valuation allowance might be released in the fourth quarter of 2016, or in a subsequent period.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized income tax expense of   $16.2 million   and   $27.2 million  , respectively. The decrease in tax expense in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is largely

due to lower pre-tax income levels. The effective tax rate was   37.2%   and   36.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Income from continuing operations    
  Income from continuing operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $8.3 million   compared to the prior-year period, largely due to the reduced operating income, partially offset by the   $2.8 million   decrease in income tax expense, and the   $0.6 million   favorable change in other (income) expense, net, described above.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , income from continuing operations decreased by   $21.1 million   compared to the same period of the prior year, largely due to the reduced operating income, as well as a   $0.3 million   write-off of deferred financing fees, partially offset by decreases in income tax and interest expense of   $11.0 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, as well as the   $2.8 million   favorable change in other (income) expense, net, described above.  
  Gain from discontinued operations and disposal, net of tax    
  The Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of   $1.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily related to adjustments of uncertain tax position reserves following the expiration of statute of limitations.  
  In the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company received the last remaining   $4.0 million   of escrow funds from the 2012 sale of the former Federal Signal Technologies Group. This income was recorded, net of $1.6 million of tax expense, as a component of   Gain from discontinued operations and disposal, net of tax   within its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Also contributing to the   $3.0 million   net gain from discontinued operations and disposal reported in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was   $0.6 million   of net income generated by the operations of the Fire Rescue Group. 
  The Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of   $3.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by the   $4.0 million   net gain on disposal of the Fire Rescue Group, which was discontinued in 2015, partially offset by the   $0.6 million   net loss that the Fire Rescue Group realized in its   2016   operations up to the   January 29, 2016   sale completion date. The net gain on disposal includes a   $1.5 million   charge to recognize a liability in connection with a Latvian commercial dispute. Also contributing to the net gain in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a reduction in uncertain tax position reserves of approximately   $1.0 million  .  
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of   $3.6 million  , primarily driven by   $1.2 million   of net income generated by the operations of the Fire Rescue Group, as well as the aforementioned net income associated with the receipt of the escrow funds. 
   
  Orders 
  The Company s historical order information presented herein includes orders received from JJE. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition of JJE, orders from JJE are no longer included in the Company s total orders. Instead, subsequent to the completion of the acquisition of JJE, total orders will include orders that JJE receives from end customers. These orders may include orders for products manufactured or supplied by the Company s Environmental Solutions Group, as well as for products manufactured or supplied by third-party vendors.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , orders that were received from JJE prior to the acquisition date, which were included in total orders, totaled   $3.7 million  . During the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015, orders that were received from JJE prior to the acquisition date, and were included in total orders reported in each of those periods, totaled   $17.9 million   and   $42.2 million  , respectively. 
  As of the   June 3, 2016   acquisition date, the Company s backlog included   $6.9 million   of orders from JJE. These orders are no longer reported in the Company s backlog as of   September 30, 2016   and have been presented as a reduction of total orders for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  On the date of acquisition, JJE had a backlog of orders from its end customers of   $43.3 million  . These acquired orders were included in total orders reported for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Total orders reported in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   includes an adjustment of $9.9 million to increase the previously-reported acquired backlog. Any orders included in the acquired backlog that had not shipped prior to the end of the third quarter are included in reported backlog as of   September 30, 2016  .

Three months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   three months ended September 30, 2015 
  Total orders increased by   $17.9 million  , or   11%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , largely driven by a   $27.5 million   increase in orders in the Environmental Solutions Group, mostly due to increased Canadian orders following the acquisition of JJE in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower international orders of sewer cleaners and vacuum trucks. Orders in the Safety and Security Systems Group decreased by   $9.6 million  , largely due to lower orders from domestic and international public safety markets.  
  U.S. municipal and governmental orders increased by 4%, primarily due to a $4.5 million improvement in municipal orders within the Environmental Solutions Group, inclusive of a $3.4 million increase in orders for sewer cleaners, as well as slightly higher orders for street sweepers. These improvements were partially offset by a $1.8 million decline in orders within the Safety and Security Systems Group, largely driven by the timing of orders received from public safety markets. 
  U.S. industrial orders increased by 9%, largely driven by a $4.8 million increase within the Environmental Solutions Group, primarily related to orders of newly acquired product lines, including orders for rental equipment and refuse trucks, which improved by $8.8 million in the aggregate, largely resulting from the JJE acquisition. This improvement was partially offset by reductions in orders for waterblasting equipment and vacuum trucks of $2.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, both of which were associated with softness in oil and gas, and other industrial markets.  
  Non-U.S. orders increased by 24%, largely due to an $18.0 million increase within the Environmental Solutions Group, reflective of increased Canadian orders received following the acquisition of JJE in the second quarter of 2016. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, non-U.S. orders decreased by $6.9 million, primarily due to lower orders from international public safety markets, coupled with a decline in orders from global industrial markets. 
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Total orders increased by   $2.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , due to a   $25.5 million   improvement in orders within the Environmental Solutions Group that was largely offset by a   $23.2 million   order reduction in the Safety and Security Systems Group. Within the Environmental Solutions Group, there was a significant increase in orders from Canada, largely due to the acquisition of $36.4 million of net orders in connection with the JJE acquisition, as well as orders received subsequent to the acquisition. That improvement was largely offset by lower domestic orders for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners, street sweepers and waterblasting equipment. The decrease in orders within the Safety and Security Systems Group was primarily due to lower orders from global industrial markets, reflective of reduced demand from oil and gas markets. 
  U.S. municipal and governmental orders increased by 2%, primarily due to a $5.0 million improvement in orders within the Environmental Solutions Group, largely attributable to a $4.7 million increase in orders for sewer cleaners, as well as orders relating to the acquisition of JJE, partially offset by lower orders for street sweepers. 
  U.S. industrial orders decreased by 7%, largely driven by a $7.5 million reduction within the Environmental Solutions Group  due to declines in orders for vacuum trucks and waterblasting equipment of $8.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by orders of newly acquired product lines, including orders for rental equipment and refuse trucks. Industrial orders in the Safety and Security Systems Group decreased by $2.1 million.  
  Non-U.S. orders increased by 5%, primarily due to a $27.8 million improvement within the Environmental Solutions Group that was largely offset by a $20.5 million decline in orders within the Safety and Security Systems Group. Within the Environmental Solutions Group, a substantial increase in Canadian orders was reflective of orders acquired in, and received subsequent to, the JJE acquisition, largely offset by declines in orders of vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners and a $6.4 million decrease in orders for street sweepers and waterblasting equipment in the Middle East. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, the decrease was primarily due to lower orders from industrial markets, including international oil, gas and coal markets, as well as a reduced orders from international public safety markets.  
  Backlog 
  Backlog was   $148.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $179.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  . The decrease of   $30.6 million  , or   17%  , was due to reductions in backlog of   $19.3 million   at the Environmental Solutions Group and   $11.3 million   at the Safety and Security Systems Group. Lower backlog within the Environmental Solutions Group is largely driven by reduced demand for vacuum trucks, including the impacts from soft oil and gas markets and from excess amounts of used equipment that reduce demand for new equipment in adjacent industrial markets. It also reflects a lower backlog for street sweepers and sewer cleaners, as a result of higher levels of fleet orders that were represented in backlog during the prior year. These decreases were largely offset by the acquisition of $36.4 million of net orders in connection with the JJE acquisition, as well as orders received subsequent to the acquisition. While total orders have improved in recent quarters, mostly due to the effects of the JJE acquisition, a higher percentage of the recent order intake is represented by orders of products manufactured by other

companies, which tend to carry a lower gross margin. As such, backlog within the Environmental Solutions Group as of   September 30, 2016   includes a less favorable mix of orders than in the prior-year, from a gross margin perspective. Decreased backlog within the Safety and Security Systems Group was primarily due to lower orders of industrial products. 
   
  Environmental Solutions 
  The following table summarizes the Environmental Solutions Group s operating results as of and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

Three months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   three months ended September 30, 2015    
  Total orders increased by   $27.5 million  , or   25%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . U.S. orders increased by $9.5 million, largely due to improvements in orders for rental equipment, refuse trucks, and used equipment of $4.9 million, $3.0 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. The improvements in U.S. orders were largely related to the JJE acquisition. Non-U.S. orders increased by $18.0 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily attributable to an $18.9 million net increase in Canadian orders, which was inclusive of the receipt of post-acquisition orders of new product lines acquired, including orders for refuse trucks, snow removal and rental equipment. The improvement in non-U.S. orders also includes an adjustment of $9.9 million to increase the previously-reported backlog acquired in connection with the JJE acquisition, and was partially offset by decreased orders of sewer cleaners and vacuum trucks in Canada of $6.6 million.  
  N  et sales increased by   $11.3 million  , or   9%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . U.S. sales decreased by $4.5 million, or 4%, primarily due to reductions in sales of vacuum trucks, street sweepers and waterblasting equipment of $6.8 million, $6.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these declines were increases in used equipment sales, sewer cleaner shipments and equipment rentals of $3.1 million, $2.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Lower sales of vacuum truck and waterblasting equipment are directly related to the ongoing softness in oil and gas markets, while the decrease in street sweeper sales into our municipal markets was primarily due to fewer fleet order shipments when compared with the prior-year quarter. Non-U.S. sales increased by $15.8 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the JJE acquisition, with higher shipments of newly acquired product lines within Canada, inclusive of refuse trucks and snow removal equipment, and increased equipment rental revenue, being partially offset by lower sales of street sweepers and sewer cleaners into the Middle East. 
  Cost of sales increased by   $17.9 million  , or   20%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, as well as the recognition of approximately   $2.5 million   of expense associated with purchase accounting effects. In connection with the acquisition of JJE, acquired equipment was adjusted to fair value, which resulted in an increase in the valuation. Upon subsequent sale of the acquired equipment, the Company is recognizing increased cost of sales based on these higher valuations. Gross margin decreased to   19.4%   from   26.6%   in the prior-year quarter, largely due to purchase accounting expense effects, reduced operating leverage, with lower absorption of manufacturing costs, as well as unfavorable sales mix, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher concentration of sales of products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin. 
  SEG A expenses increased by   $2.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , largely due to expenses associated with our current-year acquisitions of JJE and Westech. 
  Operating income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $9.0 million  , largely due to a   $6.6 million   decrease in gross profit, inclusive of the aforementioned purchase accounting expense effects, the   $2.1 million   increase in SEG A expenses and the inclusion of   $0.3 million   of acquisition and integration related expenses.

Nine months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Total orders increased by   $25.5 million  , or   8%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . U.S. orders decreased by $2.4 million, largely due to decreased orders for waterblasting equipment, street sweepers and vacuum trucks of $4.5 million, $4.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these decreases were improvements in orders of refuse trucks and rental equipment $5.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, which largely resulted from the JJE acquisition. The reduction in orders for waterblasting equipment and vacuum trucks is reflective of softness in oil and gas markets, while street sweeper orders from our municipal markets decreased primarily due to fewer fleet orders when compared with the prior-year period. Non-U.S. orders increased by $27.9 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , driven by a $36.7 million net increase in orders from Canada, which was inclusive of orders acquired in connection with the JJE acquisition and the receipt of post-acquisition orders of new product lines, including orders for refuse trucks, snow removal and rental equipment. This increase was largely offset by a combined $14.9 million decrease in Canadian orders for vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners. Orders in the Middle East and Mexico also declined $6.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively. 
  N  et sales decreased by   $40.7 million  , or   10%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . U.S. sales decreased by $50.6 million, or 15%, primarily due to reductions in sales of vacuum trucks, street sweepers and waterblasting equipment of $40.5 million, $17.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these reductions was a $5.6 million improvement in sewer cleaner sales and a $2.4 million increase in equipment rental revenue. Non-U.S. sales increased by $9.9 million, or 13%, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to a $21.8 million increase in Canadian sales, inclusive of the effects of the JJE acquisition, which has resulted in higher sales of newly-acquired product lines. Partially offsetting the sales improvement in Canada were reductions in sales of street sweepers and sewer cleaners in the Middle East and Mexico of $6.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. 
  Cost of sales decreased by   $13.6 million  , or   4%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by lower sales of vacuum trucks and street sweepers in the U.S, as well as fewer international shipments of street sweepers and sewer cleaners, partially offset by unfavorable mix effects and the recognition of the approximately   $3.0 million   of expense associated with purchase accounting effects resulting from the recognition of higher cost of sales associated with sales of acquired equipment, which were increased to fair value in connection with the JJE acquisition. Gross margin decreased to   21.8%   from   26.2%   in the prior-year period, largely due to reduced operating leverage due to lower volumes, unfavorable sales mix, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher concentration of sales of products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin, as well as purchase accounting expense effects. 
  SEG A expenses increased by   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , largely due to expenses associated with our current-year acquisitions of JJE and Westech. 
  Operating income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $30.7 million  , largely due to a   $27.1 million   decrease in gross profit, inclusive of the aforementioned purchase accounting expense effects, the   $3.3 million   increase in SEG A expenses and the inclusion of   $0.3 million   of acquisition and integration related expenses. 
  Backlog was   $118.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $137.5 million   at   September 30, 2015  . Declines in backlog for vacuum trucks reflect the direct impact from soft oil and gas markets and the impact of used equipment reducing demand for new equipment in adjacent industrial markets. The reduction also reflects lower backlog for street sweepers and sewer cleaners as a result of higher levels of fleet orders in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of $43.3 million of acquired backlog as of the date of the JJE acquisition, as well as incremental post-acquisition orders at JJE. 
   
  Safety and Security Systems

     Table of Contents  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   three months ended September 30, 2015    
  Total orders decreased by   $9.6 million   or   16%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . U.S. orders decreased by $2.7 million, or 7%, primarily due to reductions in orders for public safety and industrial products of $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The decrease in public safety is primarily due to the timing of a $1.8 million order within our police markets from a major municipality received in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in industrial orders is reflective of lower demand from domestic oil and gas markets. Non-U.S. orders decreased by $6.9 million, or 31%, largely due to a $5.0 million reduction in orders from international public safety markets. The prior-year quarter included significant orders from customers in Asia and Europe that did not repeat in the current year. In addition, orders for industrial products decreased by $2.1 million, primarily due to softness in international oil and gas markets. 
  Net sales decreased by   $4.3 million  , or   8%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . U.S. sales increased by $1.2 million, largely due to a $2.8 million increase in sales into domestic public safety markets, inclusive of sales to major municipalities. This increase was partially offset by a $1.6 million reduction in sales of industrial products into domestic oil and gas markets. Non-U.S. sales decreased by $5.5 million, principally due to a $3.3 million reduction in sales of industrial products into international oil and gas markets, as well as the absence of a $1.8 million order cancellation fee received in the prior-year quarter. 
  Cost of sales decreased by   $1.5 million  , or   4%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , largely due to the effects of lower sales volume. Gross margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased to   36.6%   compared to   38.8%   in the prior-year period, largely due to the receipt of the order cancellation fee in the prior-year quarter. 
  SEG A expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $0.4 million   lower than the prior-year quarter, largely due to lower employee costs, inclusive of the effects of previously implemented restructuring activity. 
  Operating income decreased by   $2.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , largely due to a   $2.8 million   decrease in gross profit compared to the prior-year quarter, which included an order cancellation fee of approximately $1.8 million. There was also a   $0.4 million   reduction in SEG A expenses, that was offset by   $0.4 million   of restructuring charges representing severance costs incurred in connection with a cost reduction plan in the U.S.  
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   vs.   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
  Total orders decreased by   $23.2 million   or   13%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In the aggregate, U.S. orders were down $2.7 million compared to the prior-year period, with decreases in orders of industrial products and outdoor warning systems of $3.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, being partially offset by a $3.4 million improvement in orders from public safety markets. Non-U.S. orders decreased by $20.5 million, or 28%, primarily due to a $16.4 million decrease in orders from industrial markets, including international oil, gas and coal markets, as well as a $6.8 million reduction in orders from international public safety markets. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $2.7 million improvement in international orders for outdoor warning systems, largely due to a significant order received from the Middle East. 
  Net sales decreased by   $9.1 million  , or   5%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . U.S. sales increased by $3.8 million, driven by a $9.0 million improvement in sales into public safety markets, inclusive of a number of large sales to major municipalities, combined with a $0.9 million increase in sales of outdoor warning systems. Partially offsetting these increases was a $6.0 million reduction in sales into industrial markets. Non-U.S. sales decreased by $12.9 million, or 19%, primarily due to a $13.0 million decrease in sales into international industrial markets, inclusive of the absence of a large order cancellation fee received in the prior-year period.  
  Cost of sales decreased by   $3.6 million  , or   3%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , largely due to the effects of lower sales volumes, partially offset by an unfavorable sales mix impact of $1.2 million associated with lower sales of products into industrial markets. Gross margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   35.2%   compared to   36.6%   in the prior-year period, largely due to the unfavorable sales mix effects and the inclusion of the aforementioned order cancellation fee in the prior-year period. 
  SEG A expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $1.5 million   lower than the prior-year quarter, largely due to lower employee costs, inclusive of the effects of previously implemented restructuring activities. 
  Operating income decreased by   $5.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , largely due to a   $5.5 million   decrease in gross profit. The   $1.5 million   reduction in SEG A expenses was partially offset by   $1.2 million   of restructuring charges representing severance costs incurred in the U.S.  
  Backlog was   $30.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $41.8 million   at   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to lower orders of industrial products.

Corporate Expenses 
  Corporate operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $5.5 million  , compared to   $5.6 million   in the prior-year quarter, largely due to lower employee incentive compensation costs.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , corporate operating expenses were   $18.0 million  , compared to   $18.9 million   in the prior-year period, largely due to lower employee incentive compensation costs, offset by a   $0.9 million   increase in professional service and legal fees incurred in connection with acquisition and integration related activity.  
   
  Seasonality of Company s Business 
  Certain of the Company s businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal factors, including buying patterns, delivery patterns and productivity influences from holiday periods and weather. The Company tends to have lower sales in the first calendar quarter of each year compared to other quarters as a result of these factors. 
   
  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The Company uses its cash flow from operations to fund growth and to make capital investments that sustain its operations, reduce costs, or both. Beyond these uses, remaining cash is used to pay down debt, repurchase shares, fund dividend payments and make pension contributions. The Company may also choose to invest in the acquisition of businesses. In the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, we believe that the Company s existing cash balances, cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the 2016 Credit Agreement will provide funds sufficient for these purposes. The net cash flows associated with the Company s rental equipment transactions are included in cash flow from operating activities. Subsequent to the acquisition of JJE, such net cash flows may become more significant, and as such, cash flow from operating activities may not be directly comparable with amounts reported in periods prior to the acquisition.  
  The Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled   $50.8 million   and   $76.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $14.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the U.S. typically are held in the currency of the country in which it is located. This cash is used to fund the operating activities of our foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations. Generally, we consider such cash to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such cash to fund U.S. operations. However, in the event that these funds were needed to fund U.S. operations or to satisfy U.S. obligations, they generally could be repatriated. The repatriation of these funds may then cause us to incur additional U.S. income tax expense, which would be dependent on income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any such amounts were repatriated.  
  As discussed further in Note   15     Discontinued Operations to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of   $6.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   associated with recognizing the outside basis differences of entities being sold in connection with the sale of Bronto. The deferred tax liability recorded at   December 31, 2015   included a liability for U.S. income tax effects associated with the repatriation of the related sales proceeds. The initial sales proceeds of    76 million   (approximately $  82.3 million  ) were received on   January 29, 2016  , with an additional    5.1 million   in cash (approximately   $5.7 million  ) being received in connection with the payment of the final working capital and net debt adjustments in the second quarter of   2016  . 
  Net cash of   $17.1 million   and   $60.4 million   was provided by continuing operating activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The reduction in cash generated by continuing operating activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of the prior year was largely the result of lower earnings. The operating cash flow in both current-year periods was also lower by approximately $11 million as a result of the non-cash settlement, in connection with the acquisition, of accounts receivable due from JJE. 
  Net cash of   $101.9 million   and   $3.6 million   was used for continuing investing activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Capital expenditures in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $4.8 million   and   $7.7 million  , respectively. As discussed in Note   2     Acquisitions, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company paid an initial   $96.6 million   to acquire substantially all the assets and operations of JJE, and also used   $6.0 million   to acquire Westech. In addition, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company also received   $6.0 million   from a customer as full repayment of a loan that was originally provided in the fourth quarter of   2015  . In the prior-year period, the Company received   $4.0 million   from the escrow associated with the FSTech Group divestiture. Net cash provided by discontinued investing activities totaled   $88.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which represents the net proceeds from the sale of Bronto.  
  Net cash of   $28.9 million   was used for continuing financing activities in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   $27.0 million   in the prior year. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company borrowed   $64.8 million

against its revolving credit facility, funded cash dividends of   $12.8 million  , repurchased   $33.8 million   of treasury stock, and redeemed   $2.6 million   of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees  minimum tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation. The Company also paid the remaining   $43.4 million   of term loan debt outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement and spent   $1.1 million   on fees in connection with its debt refinancing. In the prior-year period, the Company paid down   $2.9 million   of term loan debt, funded cash dividends of   $11.3 million  , repurchased   $10.6 million   of treasury stock, and redeemed   $3.2 million   of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees  minimum tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation.  
  The Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA as one measure of its long-term financial stability. The ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents total debt divided by the trailing 12-month total of income from continuing operations before interest expense, debt settlement charges, acquisition and integration related expenses, restructuring charges, purchase accounting effects, other (income) expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company uses the ratio to calibrate the magnitude of its debt and its debt capacity against adjusted EBITDA, which is used as an operating performance measure. We believe that investors use a version of this ratio in a similar manner. In addition, financial institutions (including the Company s lenders) use the ratio in connection with debt agreements to set pricing and covenant limitations. For these reasons, the Company believes that the ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s long-term financial performance and stability. Other companies may use different methods to calculate total debt to EBITDA. The following table summarizes the Company s ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA and reconciles income from continuing operations to adjusted EBITDA as of and for the trailing 12-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

On   January 27, 2016  , the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  2016 Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the  Borrowers ), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent, KeyBank National Association, as documentation agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and the other lenders and parties signatory thereto.  
  The 2016 Credit Agreement is a   $325.0 million   revolving credit facility, maturing on   January 27, 2021  , that provides for borrowings in the form of loans or letters of credit up to the aggregate availability under the facility, with a sub-limit of   $50.0 million   for letters of credit. The 2016 Credit Agreement allows for the Borrowers to borrow in denominations of U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars (up to a maximum of C  $85.0 million  ) or euros (up to a maximum of    20.0 million  ). In addition, the Company may cause the commitments to increase by up to an additional   $75.0 million  , subject to the approval of the applicable lenders providing such additional financing. Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. 
  The Company s domestic subsidiaries provide guarantees for all obligations of the Borrowers under the 2016 Credit Agreement, which is secured by a first priority security interest in all now or hereafter acquired domestic property and assets and the stock or other equity interests in each of the domestic subsidiaries and   65%   of the outstanding voting capital stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions.

     Table of Contents  

Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company s option, at a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from   0.00%   to   1.25%   for base rate borrowings and   1.00%   to   2.25%   for LIBOR borrowings. The Company must also pay a commitment fee to the lenders ranging between   0.15%   to   0.30%   per annum on the unused portion of the   $325.0 million   revolving credit facility along with other standard fees. Letter of credit fees are payable on outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable LIBOR margin plus other customary fees. 
  The Company is subject to certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants under the 2016 Credit Agreement that are to be measured at each fiscal quarter-end. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . The 2016 Credit Agreement also includes a  covenant holiday  period, which allows for the temporary increase of the minimum leverage ratio following the completion of a permitted acquisition, or a series of permitted acquisitions, when the total consideration exceeds a specified threshold. In addition, the 2016 Credit Agreement includes customary negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, restricting or limiting the Company s and its subsidiaries  ability to, among other things: (i) make non-ordinary course dispositions of assets, (ii) make certain fundamental business changes, such as merge, consolidate or enter into any similar combination, (iii) make restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases, (iv) incur indebtedness, (v) make certain loans and investments, (vi) create liens, (vii) transact with affiliates, (viii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions, (ix) make negative pledges and (x) modify subordinated debt documents. 
  Under the 2016 Credit Agreement, restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases, shall be permitted if (i) the Company s leverage ratio is less than or equal to   2.50  , (ii) the Company is in compliance with all other financial covenants and (iii) there are no existing defaults under the 2016 Credit Agreement. If its leverage ratio is more than   2.50  , the Company is still permitted to fund (i) up to   $30.0 million   of dividend payments, (ii) stock repurchases sufficient to offset dilution created by the issuance of equity as compensation to its officer, directors, employees and consultants and (iii) an incremental   $30.0 million   of other cash payments. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Borrowers may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement and the commitments from the lenders may be terminated. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company s March 13, 2013 Credit Agreement (the  2013 Credit Agreement ), which provided the Company with a   $225.0 million   senior secured credit facility comprised of a   five  -year fully funded term loan of   $75.0 million   and a   five  -year   $150.0 million   revolving credit facility. 
  Under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company was required to make quarterly installment payments against the   $75.0 million   term loan, with any remaining balance due on the maturity date of March 13, 2018. As a result of executing the 2016 Credit Agreement subsequent to   December 31, 2015  , but prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the year then ended, the   $6.9 million   current portion of term loan debt outstanding as of   December 31, 2015   was reflected as a component of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company was allowed to prepay the term loan in whole or in part prior to maturity without premium or penalty. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repaid the remaining   $43.4 million   of principal outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement.  
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , approximately   $0.3 million   of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2013 Credit Agreement were written off in connection with executing the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Company incurred   $1.1 million   of debt issuance costs in connection with the execution of the 2016 Credit Agreement. Such fees have been deferred and are being amortized over the five-year term.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $64.7 million   of cash drawn and   $19.4 million   of undrawn letters of credit under the 2016 Credit Agreement, with   $240.9 million   of net availability for borrowings. As of   December 31, 2015  , there was   no   cash drawn and   $19.2 million   of undrawn letters of credit under the   $150.0 million   revolving credit facility portion of the 2013 Credit Agreement, with   $130.8 million   of net availability for borrowings. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   borrowings against the Company s non-U.S. lines of credit which provide for borrowings of up to   $0.2 million  . 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , gross borrowings and gross payments under the 2016 Credit Agreement were   $69.8 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , there were   no   gross borrowings or gross payments under the Company s domestic revolving credit facility portion of the 2013 Credit Agreement.  
  The Company anticipates that capital expenditures for 2016 will be less than $10 million.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  There have been no material changes in the Company s contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as described in Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  , of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended December 31, 2015  , with the exception of purchase obligations, as described below. 
  Following the acquisition of JJE, the Company s purchase obligations, which primarily relate to commercial chassis, vehicle bodies and other contracts in the ordinary course of business, have increased from the $55.0 million reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , purchase obligations totaled $82.8 million, with $76.5 million in payments due in less than one year and $6.3 million in payments due in two to three years.  
   
           Item 3.  
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
     The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To mitigate this risk, the Company may utilize derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  See Item 7A,   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended December 31, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes in our market risk associated with movements in interest rates. 
  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
  Although the majority of the Company s sales, expenses and cash flow are transacted in U.S. dollars, the Company has exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Canadian Dollar, Euro and British pound. The impact of currency movements on our financial results is largely mitigated by natural hedges in our operations. As discussed in Note   2    Acquisitions to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of JJE during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Canadian operations of JJE primarily conduct business in Canadian dollars. Almost all other sales of product from the U.S. to other parts of the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. Sales from and within other currency zones are predominantly transacted in the currency of the country sourcing the product or service. Management estimates that a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would reduce full-year net sales and operating income by less than 1%. 
  The Company may also have foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates and to certain balance sheet positions. If such transactional or balance sheet exposures are material, the Company may enter into matching foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to protect against variability in exchange rates.  
   
           Item 4.  
    Controls and Procedures. 
     As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  As a matter of practice, the Company s management continues to review and document internal control and procedures for financial reporting. From time to time, the Company may make changes aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the controls and ensuring that the systems evolve with the business.   SEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of internal control over financial reporting for an acquired business from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of JJE. As of   September 30, 2016  , management has not yet fully assessed JJE s internal control over financial reporting.   Excluding the acquisition of JJE, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .

If the leverage ratio is more than   2.50  , the Company is still permitted to fund (i) up to $  30.0 million   of dividend payments, (ii) stock repurchases sufficient to offset dilution created by the issuance of equity as compensation to its officers, directors, employees and consultants and (iii) an incremental $  30.0 million   of other cash payments.

 THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS PRESS RELEASE.

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 99.2 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
  Federal Signal Corporation Reports Increased Third Quarter Sales and Orders 

GAAP earnings per share of   $0.12   for the quarter 
                
    Adjusted earnings per share of   $0.17   for the quarter 
       Oak Brook, Illinois,   November 1, 2016     Federal Signal Corporation (NYSE:FSS), a leader in environmental and safety solutions, today reported results for the third quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Consolidated net sales for the third quarter were   $186.7 million  , up   $7.0 million  , or   4%   versus the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter income from continuing operations was   $7.5 million  , equal to   $0.12   per diluted share, compared to   $15.8 million  , equal to   $0.25   per share, in the prior-year quarter. 
  The Company also reported adjusted net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of   $10.5 million  , equal to   $0.17   per diluted share, compared to   $15.8 million  , or   $0.25   per diluted share, in the same quarter a year ago. The Company is reporting adjusted results to facilitate comparisons of underlying performance on a year-over-year basis. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures is provided at the conclusion of this news release. All results discussed herein are for continuing operations, and previously reported results have been recast to reflect the Fire Rescue Group as a discontinued operation following the sale of the Bronto Skylift business in January 2016. 
  Q3 Earnings Exceed Expectations; Sales and Orders Improve with Joe Johnson Equipment ( JJE ) Acquisition 
   Our third quarter earnings were slightly better than we had been anticipating, benefiting from some earlier than expected deliveries to end customers,  commented Jennifer L. Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Total sales and orders increased in comparison to last year, mostly as a result of the JJE acquisition, which we completed in June of this year. We are pleased with our progress integrating JJE, and the JJE operating results have been running ahead of our expectations.   
  In the Environmental Solutions Group, sales were up   $11.3 million  , or   9%  , primarily due to $31.0 million of incremental net sales resulting from the JJE acquisition, largely offset by lower shipments of vacuum trucks and street sweepers in the U.S. and reduced international sales of street sweepers and sewer cleaners. Sales in the Safety and Security Systems Group decreased by   $4.3 million  , or   8%  , on reduced sales into global industrial markets, partially offset by improved sales into U.S. public safety markets.  Ongoing effects related to oil and gas end markets continue to adversely impact industrial sales in both groups. 
  Consolidated third quarter operating income was   $13.5 million  , down from   $25.2 million   in the prior-year quarter. Operating income in the current-year quarter includes   $2.5 million   of expense associated with purchase accounting effects resulting from the JJE acquisition,   $0.3 million   of acquisition-related expenses and   $0.4 million   of restructuring charges. Operating income in the prior-year period also benefited from the receipt of an order cancellation fee of approximately $1.8 million. Consolidated operating margin, including the aforementioned items, was   7.2%  , compared to   14.0%   last year. Excluding these items, consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 8.9%, compared to 13.2% last year. The margin decrease was primarily due to changes in mix within the Environmental Solutions Group, with fewer sales into industrial markets and a higher percentage of sales of products manufactured by other companies, which tend to carry a lower margin, as well as purchase accounting effects and negative operating leverage. Corporate expenses for the quarter of   $5.5 million   were about the same as a year ago.  
  The effective income tax rate for the quarter was higher than usual, at   43.2%  , largely due to recording additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Canada, where the Company experienced historical losses. The current-quarter losses in Canada primarily relate to transitory purchase accounting impacts related to the acquisition of JJE. The Company is  
  
   1 

continuing to evaluate the impact of current-year acquisitions on the need to maintain the valuation allowance. The cash tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 15-20%. 
  Consolidated orders were   $186.1 million   for the quarter, up   11%   compared to last year and at about the same level as the second quarter of 2016. Consolidated backlog of   $148.7 million   was relatively unchanged from the end of the second quarter of 2016.  
  Healthy Financial Position Supports Growth Initiatives and Strong Cash Returns to Shareholders 
  The Company funded dividends of $4.2 million and share repurchases of $0.7 million during the third quarter, bringing the totals for the year to   $12.8 million   and   $33.8 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $35 million   remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs. The Board of Directors also recently declared a $0.07 per share dividend that will be payable in the fourth quarter. 
   Our financial position continues to be very strong, providing us with a platform to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and maintain appropriate levels of investment in our sales efforts and new products to build momentum for future growth,  said Sherman.  It has also allowed us to return over $46 million of value to our shareholders so far this year, in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  
  Net cash of $13.2 million was provided by continuing operating activities in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $29.6 million in the prior-year quarter. At   September 30, 2016  , consolidated debt was   $66 million  , compared to $47 million a year ago, with   $241 million   of availability for borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   were   $51 million  , compared to $58 million a year ago. 
  Outlook 
   Our municipal markets remain stable, but like many other companies, we are experiencing challenging conditions in our industrial markets,  Sherman noted.  We are well-positioned to work through these headwinds and to benefit when our markets strengthen. We have a strong balance sheet and continue to make targeted investments in organic growth, while managing costs to maintain our profitability. 
   While our sales and orders have improved, our backlog carries a lower gross margin than in the prior-year, partly due to lower industrial demand and effects of the JJE acquisition. We expect that these unfavorable mix effects and negative operating leverage will linger into the fourth quarter, and the first quarter of next year. With solid performance from our municipal-based businesses, we are narrowing the range for our full-year 2016 adjusted EPS outlook to between $0.65 and $0.70.  
  CONFERENCE CALL 
  Federal Signal will host its third quarter conference call on Tuesday,   November 1, 2016   at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The call will last approximately one hour. The call may be accessed over the internet through Federal Signal s website at   http://www.federalsignal.com   or by dialing phone number 1-888-600-4864 and entering the pin number 9379086.

SEC REGULATION G NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION 
  The financial measures presented below are unaudited and are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided this supplemental information to investors, analysts, and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of operating results, to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliations below, and to provide an additional measure of performance which management considers in operating the business. 
  Adjusted net income and earnings per share from continuing operations ( EPS ): 
  The Company believes that modifying its 2016 and 2015 net income and diluted EPS provides additional measures which are representative of the Company s underlying performance and improve the comparability of results across reporting periods. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   adjustments were made to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS to exclude the impact of restructuring activity, acquisition and integration related expenses, purchase accounting effects and debt settlement charges, where applicable. In addition, during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , adjustments were made to reported GAAP income tax expense to exclude certain special tax items.  

(a) 
    Purchase accounting effects relate to adjustments to exclude the step-up in the valuation of acquired JJE equipment that was sold subsequent to the acquisition in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as well as to exclude the depreciation of the step-up in the valuation of the rental fleet acquired. 
              (b) 
    Adjusted income tax expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was recomputed after excluding the impact of restructuring activity, acquisition and integration related expenses, purchase accounting effects and debt settlement charges, where applicable. Adjusted income tax expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   also excludes expenses of $0.7 million associated with recording additional valuation allowance in Canada, and $0.1 million associated with a change in the enacted tax rate in the U.K. 
     
   7 

Total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio: 
  The Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA as one measure of its long-term financial stability. The ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents total debt divided by the trailing 12-month total of income from continuing operations before interest expense, debt settlement charges, acquisition and integration related expenses, restructuring charges, purchase accounting effects, other (income) expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company uses the ratio to calibrate the magnitude of its debt and its debt capacity against adjusted EBITDA, which is used as an operating performance measure. We believe that investors use a version of this ratio in a similar manner. In addition, financial institutions (including the Company s lenders) use the ratio in connection with debt agreements to set pricing and covenant limitations. For these reasons, the Company believes that the ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s long-term financial performance and stability. Other companies may use different methods to calculate total debt to EBITDA. The following table summarizes the Company s ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA and reconciles income from continuing operations to adjusted EBITDA as of and for the trailing 12-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :
