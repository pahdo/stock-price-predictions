NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 Business   

Overview   Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise,  Transocean,   we,   us  or  our ) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.  We specialize in technically demanding sectors of the offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services.  Our mobile offshore drilling fleet is considered one of the most versatile fleets in the world.  We contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews predominantly on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.  At September 30, 2016, we owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 58 mobile offshore drilling units, including 29 ultra deepwater floaters, seven harsh environment floaters, four deepwater floaters, eight midwater floaters and 10 high specification jackups.  At September 30, 2016, we also had five ultra deepwater drillships and five high specification jackups under construction or under contract to be constructed.  See Note 8 Drilling Fleet. 

Transocean Partners   On July 31, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company ( Transocean Partners ), and two of our wholly owned subsidiaries.  Upon the closing of the merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Transocean Partners will merge with one of our subsidiaries, with Transocean Partners continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Transocean Ltd.  Each of the Transocean Partners common units that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing, other than units held by Transocean and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive 1.1427 of our shares.  We expect to issue approximately 22.7 million shares, issued from conditional capital, to complete the merger.  A Transocean shareholder vote will not be required to complete the merger. 

The merger has been approved by a special committee of our board of directors, by the Transocean Partners board of directors and the Transocean Partners conflicts committee, and by the boards of directors of our subsidiary companies that are parties to the Merger Agreement.  Consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by the unitholders of Transocean Partners and other customary closing conditions.  We expect that the closing of the merger will take place in the fourth quarter of 2016.  See Note 13 Noncontrolling Interest and Note 15 Subsequent Events. 

Par value reduction   On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the reduction of the par value of each of our shares to CHF 0.10 from the original par value of CHF 15.00.  Following formal notification to creditors and establishment of a public deed of compliance, the reduction of par value became effective as of January 7, 2016, upon registration in the commercial register.  See Note 12 Shareholders  Equity. 

Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies 

Presentation   We have prepared our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Pursuant to such rules and regulations, these financial statements do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for complete financial statements.  The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods.  Such adjustments are considered to be of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise noted.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 included in our annual report on Form 10 K filed on February 25, 2016. 

Accounting estimates   To prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts, materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, assets held for sale, income taxes, contingencies, share based compensation, defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits.  We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results could differ from such estimates. 

Fair value measurements   We estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability.  Our valuation techniques require inputs that we categorize using a three level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable inputs, as follows: (1) significant observable inputs, including unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets ( Level 1 ), (2) significant other observable inputs, including direct or indirect market data for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets ( Level 2 ) and (3) significant unobservable inputs, including those that require considerable judgment for which there is little or no market data ( Level 3 ).  When multiple input levels are required for a valuation, we categorize the entire fair value

measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable. 

Capitalized interest   We capitalize interest costs for qualifying construction and upgrade projects.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we capitalized interest costs of $41 million and $130 million, respectively, for construction work in progress.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we capitalized interest costs of $36 million and $91 million, respectively, for construction work in progress. 

Reclassifications   We have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform with the current period s presentation.  Such reclassifications did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Subsequent events   We evaluate subsequent events through the time of our filing on the date we issue our financial statements.  See Note 15 Subsequent Events. 

Note 3 New Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently issued accounting standards 

Presentation of financial statements   Effective with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2016, we will adopt the accounting standards update that requires us to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  The update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim and annual periods thereafter.  We do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Stock compensation   Effective no later than January 1, 2017, we will adopt the accounting standards update that allows for simplification of the accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The update, which permits early adoption, is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.  We do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, operations or cash flows or on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue from contracts with customers   Effective January 1, 2018, we will adopt the accounting standards update that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The update, which permits early adoption, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  We are evaluating the requirements to determine the effect such requirements may have on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, operations and cash flows and on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Income taxes   Effective January 1, 2018, we will adopt the accounting standards update that requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transaction occurs as opposed to deferring such recognition into future periods.  The update, which permits early adoption, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods.  We do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, operations or cash flows or on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Leases   Effective no later than January 1, 2019, we will adopt the accounting standards update that (a) requires lessees to recognize a right to use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases, and (b) updates previous accounting standards for lessors to align certain requirements with the updates to lessee accounting standards and the revenue recognition accounting standards.  The update, which permits early adoption, is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.  We are evaluating the requirements to determine the effect such requirements may have on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, operations and cash flows and on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 Variable Interest Entities 

Angola Deepwater Drilling Company Limited ( ADDCL ), a consolidated Cayman Islands company, is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.  The carrying amount of ADDCL, after eliminating the effect of intercompany transactions, was as follows (in millions): 

Transocean Drilling Services Offshore Inc. ( TDSOI ), a consolidated British Virgin Islands company, was also a variable interest entity for which we were the primary beneficiary.  In July 2016, we completed the repurchase of the noncontrolling interest in TDSOI, and as a result, TDSOI became our wholly owned subsidiary and has been excluded from the above carrying amounts.  At December 31, 2015, the net carrying amount of TDSOI, after eliminating the effect of intercompany transactions, was $295 million, including assets of $298 million and liabilities of $3 million.  See Note 13 Noncontrolling interest. 

Note 5 Impairments 

Assets held for sale   In the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized an aggregate loss of $11 million ($0.03 per diluted share) associated with the impairment of the midwater floaters   Transocean Driller   and   Transocean Winner  , along with related and other equipment.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized an aggregate loss of $34 million ($31 million, or 0.08 per diluted share, net of tax), associated with the impairment of the deepwater floater   Sedco 702   and the midwater floaters   Transocean Driller  ,    Transocean John Shaw   and   Transocean Winner  , along with related and other equipment, which were classified as assets held for sale at the time of impairment. 

In the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized an aggregate loss of $13 million ($0.03 per diluted share), which had no tax effect, associated with the impairment of the midwater floater   GSF Rig 135   along with related equipment, which were classified as held for sale at the time of impairment.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized an aggregate loss of $664 million ($550 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, net of tax), associated with the impairment of the ultra deepwater floaters   Deepwater Expedition   and   GSF Explorer  , the deepwater floaters   GSF Celtic Sea  ,    Sedco 707   and   Transocean Rather   and the midwater floaters   GSF Aleutian Key  ,    GSF Arctic III  ,    GSF Rig 135, Transocean Amirante   and   Transocean Legend  , along with related equipment, which were classified as assets held for sale at the time of impairment. 

We measured the impairment of the drilling units and related equipment as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell.  We estimated the fair value of the assets using significant other observable inputs, representative of Level 2 fair value measurements, including indicative market values for the drilling units and related equipment to be sold for scrap value.  If we commit to plans to sell additional rigs for values below the respective carrying amounts, we may be required to recognize additional losses in future periods associated with the impairment of such assets. 

Assets held and used   During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we identified indicators that the asset groups in our contract drilling services reporting unit may not be recoverable.  Such indicators included a reduction in the number of new contract opportunities, customer suspensions of drilling programs, early contract terminations and cancellations and low dayrate fixtures.  Our deepwater and midwater asset groups, in particular, experienced significant declines in projected dayrates and utilization caused by increased competition and marginalization of some of the less capable drilling units.  As a result of our testing, we determined that the carrying amounts of the deepwater floater and midwater floater asset groups were impaired.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized losses of $507 million ($481 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, net of tax) and $668 million ($654 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, net of tax), associated with the impairment of the deepwater floater asset group and the midwater floater asset group, respectively, including losses of $41 million and $11 million, respectively, associated with construction in progress for each asset group. 

We estimated the fair value of the asset groups by applying a combination of income and cost approaches, using projected discounted cash flows and estimates of the exchange price that would be received for the assets in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.  Our estimates of fair value required us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement, including assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling services reporting unit, such as future commodity prices, projected demand for our services, rig availability and dayrates.  If we experience increasingly unfavorable changes to actual or anticipated dayrates or other impairment indicators, or if we are unable to secure new or extended contracts for our active units or the reactivation of any of our stacked units, we may be required to recognize additional losses in future periods as a result of impairments of the carrying amount of one or more of our asset groups.

Note 6 Income Taxes 

Tax rate   Transocean Ltd., a holding company and Swiss resident, is exempt from cantonal and communal income tax in Switzerland, but is subject to Swiss federal income tax.  Our provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and earn income.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our estimated effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 21.5 percent and 18.0 percent, respectively, based on estimated annual income from continuing operations before income taxes.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the various discrete period tax items was a net tax benefit of $34 million and $9 million, respectively.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, such discrete items were primarily related to the tax expense or benefits of changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with tax positions taken in prior years and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for losses not expected to be realized.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, such discrete items were primarily related to the tax effect of insurance recoveries that resulted from the resolution of certain matters associated with the Macondo well incident and losses on impairment of certain assets and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with tax positions taken in prior years. 

Tax returns   We file federal and local tax returns in several jurisdictions throughout the world.  With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to examinations of our U.S. and non U.S. tax matters for years prior to 2010.  Our tax returns in the major jurisdictions in which we operate, other than the U.S., Norway and Brazil, which are mentioned below, are generally subject to examination for periods ranging from three to six years.  We have agreed to extensions beyond the statute of limitations in two major jurisdictions for up to 20 years.  Tax authorities in certain jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and in some cases have issued assessments.  We are defending our tax positions in those jurisdictions.  While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the timing or the outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect the ultimate liability to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations, although it may have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 

U.S. tax investigations   In January 2014, we received a draft assessment from the U.S. tax authorities related to our 2010 and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns.  The significant issue raised in the assessment was related to transfer pricing for certain charters of drilling rigs between our subsidiaries.  In April 2016, we entered into a final settlement with the U.S. tax authorities for $31 million, excluding interest and penalties, related to our 2010 and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns.  The terms of this settlement are not necessarily indicative of positions that the U.S. tax authorities may take on transfer pricing or other matters with respect to our tax returns for the years following 2012. 

Norway tax investigations and trial   Norwegian civil tax authorities are investigating certain transactions undertaken by our subsidiaries in 1999, 2001 and 2002 as well as the actions of certain employees of our former external tax advisors on these transactions.  At September 30, 2016, the remaining outstanding civil tax assessment was for NOK 412 million, equivalent to approximately $52 million, plus interest, related to a 2001 dividend payment.  On June 26, 2014, the Norwegian district court in Oslo ruled that our subsidiary was liable for the civil tax assessment but waived all penalties and interest.  On September 12, 2014, we and the tax authorities each appealed the ruling.  On June 27, 2016, the tax authorities withdrew their appeal of penalties and dropped all penalty claims.  We intend to take all other appropriate action to continue to support our position that our Norwegian tax returns are materially correct as filed.  Although we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter, we do not expect the effect, if any, to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Brazil tax investigations   Certain of our Brazilian income tax returns for the years 2000 through 2004 are currently under examination.  In December 2005, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an aggregate tax assessment of BRL 806 million, equivalent to approximately $247 million, including penalties and interest, measured as of September 30, 2016.  On January 25, 2008, we filed a protest letter with the Brazilian tax authorities, and we are currently engaged in the appeals process.  On May 19, 2014, with respect to our Brazilian income tax returns for the years 2009 and 2010, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an aggregate tax assessment of BRL 137 million, equivalent to approximately $42 million, including penalties and interest, measured as of September 30, 2016.  On June 18, 2014, we filed a protest letter with the Brazilian tax authorities.  We believe our returns are materially correct as filed, and we are vigorously contesting these assessments.  An unfavorable outcome on these proposed assessments could result in a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Other tax matters   We conduct operations through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.  Each country has its own tax regimes with varying nominal rates, deductions, employee contribution requirements and tax attributes.  From time to time, we may identify changes to previously evaluated tax positions that could result in adjustments to our recorded assets and liabilities.  Although we are unable to predict the outcome of these changes, we do not expect the effect, if any, resulting from these adjustments to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 7 Earnings Per Share 

The numerator and denominator used for the computation of basic and diluted per share earnings from continuing operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we excluded from the calculation 3.6 million and 2.9 million share based awards, respectively, since the effect would have been anti dilutive.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we excluded from the calculation 5.5 million and 3.6 million share based awards, respectively, since the effect would have been anti dilutive.

Dispositions   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with our efforts to dispose of non strategic assets, we completed the sale of the deepwater floater   Deepwater Navigator   and the midwater floaters   Falcon 100, GSF Grand Banks, GSF Rig 135,     Sedneth 701   and   Transocean John Shaw,   along with related equipment.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $11 million, and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $3 million and $8 million, respectively, associated with the disposal of these assets.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received cash proceeds of $1 million and $5 million, respectively, and recognized an aggregate net loss of $2 million and $8 million, respectively, associated with the disposal of assets unrelated to rig sales. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with our efforts to dispose of non strategic assets, we completed the sale of the ultra deepwater floaters   Deepwater Expedition   and   GSF Explorer  , the deepwater floaters   Discoverer Seven Seas, Sedco 707, Sedco 710   and   Sovereign Explorer   and the midwater floaters   C. Kirk Rhein, Jr., GSF Arctic I, GSF Arctic III, J.W. McLean, Sedco 601, Sedco 700   and   Transocean Legend  , along with related equipment.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $1 million and $25 million, respectively, and recognized an aggregate net gain of $1 million and $7 million, respectively, associated with the disposal of these assets.

ended September 30, 2015, we received cash proceeds of $2 million and $8 million, respectively, and recognized an aggregate net loss of $16 million and $27 million, respectively, associated with the disposal of assets unrelated to rig sales. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we committed to a plan to sell the deepwater floater   Sedco 702   and the midwater floaters   Transocean Driller   and   Transocean Winner,   along with related equipment.  At September 30, 2016, the aggregate carrying amount of our assets held for sale was $6 million, including the deepwater floater   Sedco 702   and the midwater floaters   Transocean Driller   and   Transocean     Winner  ,     along with related equipment.  At December 31, 2015, the aggregate carrying amount of our assets held for sale was $8 million, including the deepwater floater   Deepwater Navigator   and the midwater floaters   Falcon 100, GSF Grand Banks, GSF Rig 135   and   Sedneth 701  , along with related equipment, and certain corporate assets.  See Note 5 Impairments.  See Note 15 Subsequent Events. 

Note 9 Debt 

Overview   Debt, net of debt related balances, including unamortized discounts, premiums, issue costs and fair value adjustments, was comprised of the following (in millions): 

(a) 

Transocean Inc., a 100 percent owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd., is the issuer of the notes and debentures.  Transocean Ltd. has provided a full and unconditional guarantee of the notes and debentures and borrowings under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility.  Transocean Ltd. has no independent assets or operations, and following the completion of certain restructuring transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, its only other subsidiary not owned indirectly through Transocean Inc. was minor.  Transocean Inc. has no independent assets and operations, other than those related to its investments in non guarantor operating companies and balances primarily pertaining to its cash and cash equivalents and debt.  Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. are not subject to any significant restrictions on their ability to obtain funds from their consolidated subsidiaries by dividends, loans or return of capital distributions  .  See Note 15 Subsequent Events.     

(b) 

Transocean Inc. is the issuer of the unregistered notes.  Transocean Ltd. and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Transocean Inc. (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ) have provided a full and unconditional guarantee of the notes.  Such notes rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank structurally senior to the extent of the value of the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors.     

Five Year Revolving Credit Facility   In June 2014, we entered into an amended and restated bank credit agreement, which established a $3.0 billion unsecured five year revolving credit facility, that is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019 (the  Five Year Revolving Credit Facility ).  Among other things, the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility includes limitations on creating liens, incurring subsidiary debt, transactions with affiliates, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and the sale of substantially all assets.  The Five Year Revolving Credit Facility also includes a covenant imposing a maximum debt to tangible capitalization ratio of 0.6 to 1.0.  Borrowings under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default, borrowings are guaranteed by Transocean Ltd. and may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty. 

We may borrow under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (the  Five Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin ), which ranges from 1.125 percent to 2.0 percent based on the credit rating of our

non credit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt ( Debt Rating ), or (2) the base rate specified in the credit agreement plus the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin, less one percent per annum.  Throughout the term of the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility, we pay a facility fee on the daily unused amount of the underlying commitment which ranges from 0.15 percent to 0.35 percent depending on our Debt Rating.  Effective May 17, 2016, as a result of a further reduction of our Debt Rating, the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin increased to 2.0 percent from 1.75 percent and the facility fee increased to 0.35 percent from 0.275 percent.  At September 30, 2016, based on our Debt Rating on that date, the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin was 2.0 percent and the facility fee was 0.35 percent.  At September 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued, and we had $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility. 

Interest rate adjustments   The interest rates for certain of our notes are subject to adjustment from time to time upon a change to our Debt Rating.  Effective April 15, 2016, as a result of a reduction of our Debt Rating, the interest rates on the 2.5% Senior Notes due October 2017 (the  2.5% Senior Notes ) and the 3.8% Senior Notes due October 2022 (the  3.8% Senior Notes ) increased to 3.75 percent and 5.05 percent, respectively.  Effective June 15, 2016, as a result of a further reduction of our Debt Rating, the interest rates on the 5.05% Senior Notes due December 2016 (the  5.05% Senior Notes ), the 6.375% Senior Notes due December 2021 (the  6.375% Senior Notes ) and the 7.35% Senior Notes due December 2041 increased to 6.80 percent, 8.125 percent and 9.10 percent, respectively.  Effective October 15, 2016, as a result of a further reduction of our Debt Rating, the interest rates on the 2.5% Senior Notes and the 3.8% Senior Notes will increase to 4.25 percent and 5.55 percent, respectively. 

Debt issuance   On July 21, 2016, we completed an offering of an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2023 (the  9.00% Senior Notes ), and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $1.21 billion, net of initial discount and estimated costs payable by us.  We used the majority of the net proceeds from the debt offering to complete the Tender Offer (see  Debt tender offer ).  The 9.00% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Transocean Ltd. and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Transocean Inc.  We will pay interest on the 9.00% Senior Notes semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2017.  We may redeem all or a portion of the 9.00% Senior Notes at any time prior to July 15, 2020 at a price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount plus a make whole provision, and on or after July 15, 2020, at specified redemption prices.  The indenture that governs the 9.00% Senior Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain liens on our drilling units without equally and ratably securing the notes, engage in certain sale and lease back transactions covering any of our drilling units, allow our subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt, and consolidate, merge or enter into a scheme of arrangement qualifying as an amalgamation.  See Note 15 Subsequent Events. 

Debt tender offer   On August 1, 2016, we completed a tender offer (the  Tender Offer ) to purchase for cash up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.50% Senior Notes due November 2020 (the  6.50% Senior Notes ), 6.375% Senior Notes and 3.8% Senior Notes (collectively, the  Tendered Notes ), subject to the terms and conditions specified in the related offer to purchase.  In connection with the Tender Offer, we received valid tenders from holders of an aggregate principal amount of the Tendered Notes as follows: $348 million of the 6.50% Senior Notes, $476 million of the 6.375% Senior Notes and $157 million of the 3.8% Senior Notes.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made an aggregate cash payment of $876 million to settle the Tendered Notes, and we recognized an aggregate gain of $104 million associated with the retirement of debt. 

Debt repurchases and redemptions   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased in the open market an aggregate principal amount of $137 million and $365 million, respectively, of our debt securities for an aggregate cash payment of $131 million and $320 million, respectively.  As a result of the repurchases, we retired the respective aggregate principal amounts of the notes as follows: $36 million of the 5.05% Senior Notes, $65 million of the 2.5% Senior Notes, $35 million of the 6.00% Senior Notes due March 2018 (the  6.00% Senior Notes ), $26 million of the 7.375% Senior Notes due April 2018, $32 million of the 6.50% Senior Notes, $120 million of the 6.375% Senior Notes, $38 million of the 3.8% Senior Notes, $8 million of the 7.45% Notes due April 2027 and $5 million of the 7.5% Notes due April 2031.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized an aggregate gain of $6 million and $44 million, respectively, associated with the retirement of such notes. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased in the open market an aggregate principal amount of $292 million of our debt securities for an aggregate cash payment of $274 million.  As a result of the repurchases, we retired the respective aggregate principal amounts of the notes as follows: $5 million of the 5.05% Senior Notes, $107 million of the 2.5% Senior Notes, $134 million of the 6.00% Senior Notes, $30 million of the 6.375% Senior Notes and $16 million of the 3.8% Senior Notes.  Additionally, we completed the full redemption of $893 million aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 4.95% Senior Notes due November 2015 for an aggregate cash payment of $904 million.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $7 million associated with the retirement of such repurchased or redeemed notes.

Note 10 Postemployment Benefit Plans 

We maintain certain funded and unfunded defined benefit plans in the U.S., under which benefits have ceased accruing (collectively, the  U.S. Plans ).  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we permitted certain participants of one of our funded U.S. Plans to elect to receive a payment of retirement benefits in the form of either (a) a lump sum distribution or (b) an annuity starting October 1, 2016. 

We also maintain defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, Norway, Nigeria and Indonesia (collectively, the  Non U.S. Plans ).  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, benefits ceased accruing under the defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom and certain defined benefit plans in Norway.  Additionally, we maintain certain unfunded other postretirement employee benefit plans (collectively, the  OPEB Plans ), under which benefits to eligible participants diminish during a phase out period ending December 31, 2025. 

The components of net periodic benefit costs, before tax, and funding contributions for these plans were as follows (in millions): 

Note 11 Contingencies 

Macondo well incident contingencies 

Overview   On April 22, 2010, the ultra deepwater floater   Deepwater Horizon   sank after a blowout of the Macondo well caused a fire and explosion on the rig off the coast of Louisiana.  At the time of the explosion,   Deepwater Horizon   was contracted to an affiliate of BP plc (together with its affiliates,  BP ).  Following the incident, we have been subject to civil and criminal claims, as well as causes of action, fines and penalties by local, state and federal governments.  Litigation commenced shortly after the incident, and most claims against us were consolidated by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the  MDL Court ).  A significant portion of the contingencies arising from the Macondo well incident has now been resolved as a result of settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice (the  DOJ ), BP, the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively, the  States ) and the Plaintiffs  Steering Committee (the  PSC ). 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with settlements, as further described below, we recognized income of $788 million ($735 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, net of tax), recorded as a net reduction to operating and maintenance costs and expenses, including $538 million associated with recoveries from insurance for our previously incurred losses, $125 million associated with partial reimbursement from BP for our previously incurred legal costs, and $125 million associated with a net reduction to

certain related contingent liabilities, primarily associated with contingencies that were either settled or otherwise resolved as a result of settlements with BP and the PSC. 

We have recognized a liability for the remaining estimated loss contingencies associated with litigation resulting from the Macondo well incident that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be made.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the liability for estimated loss contingencies that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be made was $250 million, recorded in other current liabilities.  The remaining litigation could result in certain loss contingencies that we believe are reasonably possible.  Although we have not recognized a liability for such loss contingencies, these contingencies could result in liabilities that we ultimately recognize. 

We recognize an asset associated with the portion of our estimated losses that we believe is probable of recovery from insurance and for which we have received from underwriters  confirmation of expected payment.  Although we have available policy limits that could result in additional amounts recoverable from insurance, recovery of such additional amounts is not probable and we are not currently able to estimate such amounts (see   Insurance coverage ).  Our estimates involve a significant amount of judgment. 

Plea Agreement   Pursuant to the plea agreement (the  Plea Agreement ), one of our subsidiaries pled guilty to one misdemeanor count of negligently discharging oil into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, in violation of the Clean Water Act ( CWA ) and agreed to be subject to probation through February 2018.  The DOJ agreed, subject to the provisions of the Plea Agreement, not to further prosecute us for certain matters arising from the Macondo well incident.  We also agreed to make an aggregate cash payment of $  400   million, including a criminal fine of $100 million and cash contributions of $150 million to the National Fish   Wildlife Foundation and $150 million to the National Academy of Sciences, payable in scheduled installments.  In each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we made an aggregate cash payment of $60 million in satisfaction of amounts due under the Plea Agreement.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our liability for settlement obligations under the Plea Agreement was $60 million and $120 million, respectively. 

Consent Decree   Under the civil consent decree (the  Consent Decree ), we agreed to undertake certain actions, including enhanced safety and compliance actions when operating in U.S. waters.  The Consent Decree also requires us to submit certain plans, reports and submissions and also requires us to make such submittals available publicly.  One of the required plans is a performance plan (the  Performance Plan ) that contains, among other things, interim milestones for actions in specified areas and schedules for reports required under the Consent Decree.  On January 2, 2014, the DOJ approved our proposed Performance Plan.  Additionally, in compliance with the requirements of the Consent Decree and upon approval by the DOJ, we have retained an independent auditor to review and report to the DOJ our compliance with the Consent Decree and an independent process safety consultant to review report and assist with the process safety requirements of the Consent Decree.  We may request termination of the Consent Decree after January 2, 2019, provided we meet certain conditions set forth in the Consent Decree.  The Consent Decree resolved the claim by the U.S. for civil penalties under the CWA.  The Consent Decree did not resolve the U.S. claim under the Oil Pollution Act ( OPA ) for natural resource damages ( NRD ) or for removal costs.  However, BP has agreed to indemnify us for NRD and most removal costs (see   BP Settlement Agreement ). 

EPA Agreement   On February 25, 2013, we and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) entered into an agreement (the  EPA Agreement ), which has a five year term.  Subject to our compliance with the terms of the EPA Agreement, the EPA agreed that it will not suspend, debar or statutorily disqualify us and will lift any existing suspension, debarment or statutory disqualification.  In the EPA Agreement, we agreed to comply with our obligations under the Plea Agreement and the Consent Decree and continue the implementation of certain programs and systems designed to enhance our environmental management systems and improve our environmental performance.  We also agreed to other specified actions, including the (i) scheduled revision of our environmental management system and maintenance of certain compliance and ethics programs; (ii) compliance with certain employment and contracting procedures; (iii) engagement of an independent compliance auditor to, among other things, assess and report to the EPA on our compliance with the terms of the Plea Agreement, the Consent Decree and the EPA Agreement and (iv) provision of reports and notices with respect to various matters, including those related to compliance, misconduct, legal proceedings, audit reports, the EPA Agreement, the Consent Decree and the Plea Agreement.  The EPA Agreement prohibits us from entering into, extending or engaging in certain business relationships with individuals or entities that are debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or similarly restricted. 

BP Settlement Agreement   On May 20, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with BP (the  BP Settlement Agreement ).  Under the BP Settlement Agreement, BP agreed to indemnify us for compensatory damages, including all NRD and all cleanup and removal costs for oil or pollutants originating from the Macondo well.  BP also agreed to cease efforts to recover as an unlimited additional insured under our insurance policies and to be bound to the insurance reimbursement rulings related to the Macondo well incident.  We agreed to indemnify BP for personal and bodily injury claims of our employees and for any future costs for the cleanup or removal of pollutants stored on the   Deepwater Horizon   vessel.  Additionally, we mutually agreed to release and withdraw all claims we have against each other arising from the Macondo well litigation and to refrain from making statements regarding gross negligence in the Macondo well incident.  In July 2015, pursuant to the BP Settlement Agreements, we received $125 million from BP as partial reimbursement of the legal costs we incurred in connection with the Macondo well incident.  We believe the BP Settlement

(Unaudited) 

Agreement resolved all Macondo well-related litigation between BP and us, and the indemnity BP committed to provide will generally address claims by third parties, including claims for economic and property damages, economic loss and NRD.  However, the indemnity obligations do not extend to fines, penalties, or punitive damages. 

PSC Settlement Agreement   On May 29, 2015, together with the PSC, we filed a settlement agreement (the  PSC Settlement Agreement ) with the MDL Court for approval.  Through the PSC Settlement Agreement, we agreed to pay a total of $212 million, plus up to $25 million for partial reimbursement of attorneys  fees, to be allocated between two classes of plaintiffs as follows: (1) private plaintiffs, businesses, and local governments who could have asserted punitive damages claims against us under general maritime law (the  Punitive Damages Class ); and (2) private plaintiffs who previously settled economic damages claims against BP and were assigned certain claims BP had made against us (the  Assigned Claims Class ).  A court appointed neutral representative established the allocation of the settlement payment to be 72.8 percent paid to the Punitive Damages Class and 27.2 percent paid to the Assigned Claims Class.  In exchange for these payments, each of the classes agreed to release all respective claims it has against us.  Members of the Punitive Damages Class were given the opportunity to opt out of the PSC Settlement Agreement before September 23, 2016, and 36 claimants timely opted out, to pursue punitive damages claims against us.  In June 2016 and August 2015, we made a cash deposit of $25 million and $212 million, respectively, into escrow accounts pending approval of the settlement by the MDL Court.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate balance in escrow was $237 million and $212 million, respectively, recorded in other current assets. 

Multidistrict litigation proceeding   The Phase One trial in 2013 addressed fault for the Macondo blowout and resulting oil spill.  The MDL Court s September 2014 Phase One ruling concluded that BP was grossly negligent and reckless and 67 percent at fault for the blowout, explosion, and spill; that we were negligent and 30 percent at fault; and that Halliburton Company ( Halliburton ) was negligent and three percent at fault.  The finding that we were negligent, but not grossly negligent, meant that, subject to a successful appeal, we would not be held liable for punitive damages and that BP was required to honor its contractual agreements to indemnify us for compensatory damages and release its claims against us.  Our settlements with BP and the PSC finally resolve the indemnity and release issues (see   BP Settlement Agreement  and   PSC Settlement Agreement ) and, upon court approval of such settlements, largely eliminate our risk should these determinations be reversed through the appeal process.  The MDL Court also concluded that we were an  operator  of the Macondo well for purposes of 33 U.S.C.   2704(c)(3), a provision of OPA that permits government entities to recover removal costs, such as costs associated with the containment and removal of oil, from owners and operators of a facility or vessel that caused a discharge.  The MDL Court, however, found that  Transocean s liability to government entities for removal costs is ultimately shifted to BP by virtue of contractual indemnity,  and BP has agreed to indemnify removal costs for oil or containment originating in the Macondo well through the BP Settlement Agreement (see   BP Settlement Agreement ).  In September 2014, the MDL Court ruled on the liability phase trial, and additional litigation and appeals continue.  The Phase One ruling did not quantify damages or result in a final monetary judgment.  However, as a result of our settlements, all appeals have been dismissed, thereby making the Phase One ruling final with respect to Transocean. 

Pending claims   As of September 30, 2016, numerous complaints remain pending against us, along with other unaffiliated defendants in the MDL Court.  We believe our settlement with the PSC, if approved by the MDL Court on November 10, 2016, will resolve many of these pending actions.  As for any actions not resolved by these settlements, including any claims by individuals who opt out of the PSC Settlement Agreement and federal securities actions, we are vigorously defending those claims and pursuing any and all defenses available.  See  PSC Settlement Agreement  and   Federal securities claims.  

Federal securities claims   On September 30, 2010, a proposed federal securities class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  In the action, a former shareholder of the acquired company alleged that the joint proxy statement related to our shareholder meeting in connection with the merger with the acquired company violated various securities laws and that the acquired company s shareholders received inadequate consideration for their shares as a result of the alleged violations and sought compensatory and rescissory damages and attorneys  fees.  On March 11, 2014, the District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the claims as time-barred.  Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the  Second Circuit ), but on March 17, 2016, the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal.  Plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 12, 2016. 

State and other government claims   The majority of the state, local and non U.S. government claims initially filed against us have either been settled or dismissed.  Claims filed by the Mexican federal government under the OPA and maritime law are pending review in the MDL Court. 

Insurance coverage   At the time of the Macondo well incident, our excess liability insurance program offered aggregate insurance coverage of $950 million, excluding a $15 million deductible and a $50 million self-insured layer through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.  This excess liability insurance coverage consisted of a first and a second layer of $150 million each, a third and fourth layer of $200 million each and a fifth layer of $250 million.  We have recovered costs under the first four excess layers, the limits of which are now fully exhausted.  We have submitted claims to the $250 million fifth layer, which if paid, will exhaust such coverage.  This layer is comprised of Bermuda market insurers (the  Bermuda Insurers ).  The Bermuda Insurers have asserted various coverage defenses to our claims, and we have issued arbitration notices to the Bermuda Insurers.

Other legal proceedings 

Asbestos litigation   In 2004, several of our subsidiaries were named, along with numerous other unaffiliated defendants, in 21 complaints filed on behalf of 769 plaintiffs in the Circuit Courts of the State of Mississippi, and in 2014, a group of similar complaints were filed in Louisiana.  The plaintiffs, former employees of some of the defendants, generally allege that the defendants used or manufactured asbestos containing drilling mud additives for use in connection with drilling operations, claiming negligence, products liability, strict liability and claims allowed under the Jones Act and general maritime law.  The plaintiffs generally seek awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, but the court appointed special master has ruled that a Jones Act employer defendant, such as us, cannot be sued for punitive damages.  At September 30, 2016, 15 plaintiffs have claims pending in Mississippi and eight plaintiffs have claims pending in Louisiana in which we have or may have an interest.    We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, although we can provide no assurance as to the outcome.  We have historically maintained broad liability insurance, although we are not certain whether insurance will cover the liabilities, if any, arising out of these claims.  Based on our evaluation of the exposure to date, we do not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these claims to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

One of our subsidiaries was involved in lawsuits arising out of the subsidiary s involvement in the design, construction and refurbishment of major industrial complexes.  The operating assets of the subsidiary were sold and its operations were discontinued in 1989, and the subsidiary has no remaining assets other than insurance policies, rights and proceeds, including (i) certain policies subject to litigation and (ii) certain rights and proceeds held directly or indirectly through a qualified settlement fund.  The subsidiary has been named as a defendant, along with numerous other companies, in lawsuits alleging bodily injury or personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos.  As of September 30, 2016, the subsidiary was a defendant in approximately 280 lawsuits, some of which include multiple plaintiffs, and we estimate that there are approximately 302 plaintiffs in these lawsuits.  For many of these lawsuits, we have not been provided with sufficient information from the plaintiffs to determine whether all or some of the plaintiffs have claims against the subsidiary, the basis of any such claims, or the nature of their alleged injuries.  The first of the asbestos related lawsuits was filed against the subsidiary in 1990.  Through September 30, 2016, the costs incurred to resolve claims, including both defense fees and expenses and settlement costs, have not been material, all known deductibles have been satisfied or are inapplicable, and the subsidiary s defense fees and expenses and settlement costs have been met by insurance made available to the subsidiary.  The subsidiary continues to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits, and we cannot predict the number of additional cases in which it may be named a defendant nor can we predict the potential costs to resolve such additional cases or to resolve the pending cases.  However, the subsidiary has in excess of $1.0 billion in insurance limits potentially available to the subsidiary.  Although not all of the policies may be fully available due to the insolvency of certain insurers, we believe that the subsidiary will have sufficient funding directly or indirectly from settlements and claims payments from insurers, assigned rights from insurers and coverage in place settlement agreements with insurers to respond to these claims.  While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the outcome of these matters, we do not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from these claims will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Rio de Janeiro tax assessment   In the third quarter of 2006, we received tax assessments of BRL 472 million, equivalent to approximately $145 million, including interest and penalties, measured as of September 30, 2016, from the state tax authorities of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil against one of our Brazilian subsidiaries for taxes on equipment imported into the state in connection with our operations.  The assessments resulted from a preliminary finding by these authorities that our record keeping practices were deficient.  We currently believe that the substantial majority of these assessments are without merit.  We filed an initial response with the Rio de Janeiro tax authorities on September 9, 2006 refuting these additional tax assessments.  In September 2007, we received confirmation from the state tax authorities that they believe the additional tax assessments are valid, and as a result, we filed an appeal on September 27, 2007 to the state Taxpayer s Council contesting these assessments.  While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Brazilian import license assessment   In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received an assessment from the Brazilian federal tax authorities in Rio de Janeiro of BRL 613 million, equivalent to approximately $188 million, including interest and penalties, measured as of September 30, 2016, based upon the alleged failure to timely apply for import licenses for certain equipment and for allegedly providing improper information on import license applications.  We believe that a substantial majority of the assessment is without merit and are vigorously pursuing legal remedies.  The case was decided partially in favor of our Brazilian subsidiary in the lower administrative court level.  The decision cancelled the majority of the assessment, reducing the total assessment to BRL 40 million, equivalent to approximately $12 million.  On July 14, 2011, we filed an appeal to eliminate the assessment.  On May 23, 2013, a ruling was issued that eliminated all assessment amounts.  A further appeal by the taxing authorities was filed in November 2014 and accepted for review in April 2015.  In May 2016, we lost the appeal at the administrative level.  We intend to appeal this decision at the judicial level.  While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Nigerian Cabotage Act litigation   In October 2007, three of our subsidiaries were each served a Notice and Demand from the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, imposing a two percent surcharge on the value of all contracts performed by us in

Nigeria pursuant to the Coastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Act 2003 (the  Cabotage Act ).  Our subsidiaries each filed an originating summons in the Federal High Court in Lagos challenging the imposition of this surcharge on the basis that the Cabotage Act and associated levy is not applicable to drilling rigs.  The respondents challenged the competence of the suits on several procedural grounds.  The court upheld the objections and dismissed the suits.  In December 2010, our subsidiaries filed a new joint Cabotage Act suit.  While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect the proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Other matters   We are involved in various tax matters, various regulatory matters, and a number of claims and lawsuits, asserted and unasserted, all of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business.  We do not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these other matters to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the litigation matters specifically described above or of any such other pending, threatened, or possible litigation or liability.  We can provide no assurance that our beliefs or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any tax, regulatory, lawsuit or other litigation matter will prove correct and the eventual outcome of these matters could materially differ from management s current estimates. 

Other environmental matters 

Hazardous waste disposal sites   We have certain potential liabilities under the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) and similar state acts regulating cleanup of various hazardous waste disposal sites, including those described below.  CERCLA is intended to expedite the remediation of hazardous substances without regard to fault.  Potentially responsible parties ( PRPs ) for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site.  Liability is strict and can be joint and several. 

We have been named as a PRP in connection with a site located in Santa Fe Springs, California, known as the Waste Disposal, Inc. site.  Under a consent decree entered by the court, we and other PRPs agreed with the EPA and the DOJ to settle our potential liabilities for this site by agreeing to perform the remaining remediation required by the EPA.  The parties to the settlement entered into a participation agreement, under which we agreed to pay for approximately eight percent of the remediation and related costs.  The remediation is complete, and we believe our share of the future operation and maintenance costs of the site is not material.  There are additional potential liabilities related to the site, but these cannot be quantified, and we have no reason at this time to believe that they will be material. 

One of our subsidiaries has been ordered by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board ( CRWQCB ) to develop a testing plan for a site known as Campus 1000 Fremont in Alhambra, California, which is now a part of the San Gabriel Valley, Area 3, Superfund site.  We were also advised that one or more of our subsidiaries that formerly owned and operated the site would likely be named by the EPA as PRPs.  The current property owner, an unrelated party, performed the required testing and detected no contaminants.  In discussions with CRWQCB staff, we were advised of their intent to issue us a  no further action  letter, but it has not yet been received.  Based on the test results, we would contest any potential liability.  We have no knowledge at this time of the potential cost of any remediation, who else will be named as PRPs, and whether in fact any of our subsidiaries is a responsible party.  The subsidiaries in question do not own any operating assets and have limited ability to respond to any liabilities. 

Resolutions of other claims by the EPA, the involved state agency or PRPs are at various stages of investigation.  These investigations involve determinations of (a) the actual responsibility attributed to us and the other PRPs at the site, (b) appropriate investigatory or remedial actions and (c) allocation of the costs of such activities among the PRPs and other site users.  Our ultimate financial responsibility in connection with those sites may depend on many factors, including (i) the volume and nature of material, if any, contributed to the site for which we are responsible, (ii) the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and (iii) the remediation methods and technology to be used. 

It is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential cost of these environmental matters, particularly in respect of remediation obligations.  Nevertheless, based upon the information currently available, we believe that our ultimate liability arising from all environmental matters, including the liability for all other related pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is adequately accrued and should not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Letters of credit and surety bonds 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $68 million and $153 million, respectively, issued under various committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by several banks to guarantee various contract bidding, performance activities and customs obligations.  As is customary in the contract drilling business, we also have various surety bonds in place that secure customs obligations related to the importation of our rigs and certain performance and other obligations.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding surety bonds totaling $31 million and $30 million, respectively.

Note 12 Shareholders  Equity 

Par value reduction   On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the reduction of the par value of each of our shares to CHF 0.10 from the original par value of CHF 15.00.  Following a formal notification to creditors and establishment of a public deed of compliance, the reduction of par value, which was approved at our extraordinary general meeting held on October 29, 2015, became effective as of January 7, 2016 upon registration in the commercial register. 

Distributions of qualifying additional paid in capital   In May 2015, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the distribution of qualifying additional paid in capital in the form of a U.S. dollar denominated dividend of $0.60 per outstanding share, payable in four quarterly installments of $0.15 per outstanding share, subject to certain limitations.  In May 2015, we recognized a liability of $218 million for the distribution payable, recorded in other current liabilities, with a corresponding entry to additional paid in capital.  On June 17 and September 23, 2015, we paid the first two installments in the aggregate amount of $109 million to shareholders of record as of May 29 and August 25, 2015.  On October 29, 2015, shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting approved the cancellation of the third and fourth installments of the distribution.  As a result, we reduced our distribution payable, recorded in other current liabilities, by $109 million with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital. 

In May 2014, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the distribution of qualifying additional paid in capital in the form of a U.S. dollar denominated dividend of $3.00 per outstanding share, payable in four quarterly installments of $0.75 per outstanding share, subject to certain limitations.  On March 18, 2015, we paid the final installment in the aggregate amount of $272 million to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2015. 

We did not pay the distribution of qualifying additional paid in capital with respect to our shares formerly held in treasury or held by our subsidiary. 

Shares held in treasury   In May 2009, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved and authorized our board of directors, at its discretion, to repurchase an amount of our shares for cancellation with an aggregate purchase price of up to CHF 3.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $3.6 billion.  On February 12, 2010, our board of directors authorized our management to implement the share repurchase program.  At December 31, 2015, we held 2.9 million shares in treasury, recorded at cost.  On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the cancellation of all shares that have been repurchased to date under our share repurchase program.   Following a formal notification to creditors and establishment of a public deed of compliance, the cancellation of our shares held in treasury became effective as of January 7, 2016 upon registration in the commercial register. 

Shares held by subsidiary   One of our subsidiaries holds our shares for future use to satisfy our obligations to deliver shares in connection with awards granted under our incentive plans or other rights to acquire our shares.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our subsidiary held 5.5 million shares and 6.9 million shares, respectively. 

Accumulated other comprehensive loss   The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, presented net of tax, which resulted from components of net periodic benefit costs for our defined benefit plans, were as follows (in millions):

Note 13 Noncontrolling Interest 

Transocean Partners   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we held 21.3 million common units and 27.6 million subordinated units of Transocean Partners and all of the incentive distribution rights.  The remaining publicly held common units represent the noncontrolling interest in Transocean Partners.   

On November 4, 2015, Transocean Partners announced that its board of directors approved a unit repurchase program, authorizing it to repurchase for cancellation up to $40 million of its publicly held common units.  Subject to market conditions, Transocean Partners may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  It may suspend or discontinue the program at any time.  The Merger Agreement restricts Transocean Partners  ability to repurchase its common units without our consent, and no such repurchases have been made since entering into the agreement.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Transocean Partners repurchased 386,876 of its publicly held common units for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Transocean Partners had outstanding 19.7 million and 20.0 million publicly held common units, respectively.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the common and subordinated units held by us collectively represented a 71.3 percent and 70.9 percent, respectively, limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Transocean Partners declared and paid an aggregate distribution of $74 million to its unitholders, of which $21 million was paid to holders of noncontrolling interest. 

See Note 15 Subsequent Events. 

TDSOI   In June 2016, we served notice of our intent to exercise our option to call the 30 percent ownership interest in TDSOI held by our local partner.  In July 2016, we completed the repurchase of the noncontrolling interest for a cash payment of $2 million, and as a result, TDSOI became our wholly owned subsidiary.  In connection with the transaction, we recorded a capital allocation resulting in a $12 million increase to noncontrolling interest and a corresponding decrease to additional paid in capital. 

Note 14 Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments were as follows (in millions): 

We estimated the fair value of each class of financial instruments, for which estimating fair value is practicable, by applying the following methods and assumptions: 

Cash and cash equivalents   The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents represents the historical cost, plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of those instruments.  We measured the estimated fair value of our cash equivalents using significant other observable inputs, representative of a Level 2 fair value measurement, including the net asset values of the investments.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate carrying amount of our cash equivalents was $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. 

Restricted cash balances and investments   The carrying amount of the restricted cash balances that are subject to restrictions due to legislation, regulation or court order approximates fair value due to the short term nature of the instruments in which the restricted cash balances are held.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate carrying amount of such restricted cash balances was $278 million and $251 million, respectively. 

The carrying amount of the restricted cash investments associated with the Eksportfinans Loans due January 2018 (the  Eksportfinans Restricted Cash Investments ) represents the amortized cost of our investment.  We measured the estimated fair value of the Eksportfinans Restricted Cash Investments using significant other observable inputs, representative of a Level 2 fair value measurement, including the terms and credit spreads of the instruments.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate carrying amount of the Eksportfinans Restricted Cash Investments was $133 million and $216 million, respectively.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the Eksportfinans Restricted Cash Investments was $136 million and $223 million, respectively. 

Debt   We measured the estimated fair value of our debt, all of which was fixed rate debt, using significant other observable inputs, representative of a Level 2 fair value measurement, including the terms and credit spreads for the instruments.

Secured debt offering   On October 19, 2016, we completed an offering of an aggregate principal amount of $600 million of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 15, 2024 (the  Senior Secured Notes ), and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $583 million, net of initial discount and estimated costs payable by us.  Additionally, we are required to make a cash deposit of approximately $53 million into a debt service reserve, a restricted cash account to be held by the Trustee and excluded from cash and cash equivalents on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The Senior Secured Notes are secured by the assets and earnings associated with the ultra deepwater floater   Deepwater Thalassa   and the equity of the subsidiary that owns the drilling unit.  The Senior Secured Notes are also fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Transocean Ltd., Transocean Inc. and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. 

We will pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2017.  Additionally, on each interest payment date, we will be required to redeem, on a pro rata basis, an aggregate principal amount of $30 million of the notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount.  We may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or prior to October 15, 2020 at a price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount plus a make whole provision.  We will be required to redeem the notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount, without a make whole provision, upon the occurrence of certain events related to the collateral rig and the related drilling contract. 

The indenture that governs the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain liens on our drilling units without equally and ratably securing the notes, engage in certain sale and lease back transactions covering any of our drilling units, allow our subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt, and consolidate, merge or enter into a scheme of arrangement qualifying as an amalgamation and limits the ability of our subsidiaries that own or operate   Deepwater Thalassa   to declare or pay dividends. 

Transocean Partners   On October 4, 2016, Transocean Partners announced that it would convene a special meeting of its common unitholders to approve the Merger Agreement with us.  The meeting, which will be open to unitholders of record as of September 22, 2016, will be held on November 11, 2016. 

Dispositions   Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we committed to a plan to sell for scrap the midwater floater   Sedco 704   and related equipment.  At September 30, 2016, the aggregate carrying amount of the assets was $5 million.

Business 

Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise,  Transocean,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.  As of October 25, 2016, we owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 57 mobile offshore drilling units, including 29 ultra deepwater floaters, seven harsh environment floaters, four deepwater floaters, seven midwater floaters, and 10 high specification jackups.  At October 25, 2016, we also had five ultra deepwater drillships and five high specification jackups under construction or under contract to be constructed. 

We provide contract drilling services in a single, global operating segment, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and work crews primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.  We specialize in technically demanding regions of the offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services.  We believe our drilling fleet is one of the most versatile fleets in the world, consisting of floaters and high specification jackups used in support of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis. 

Our contract drilling services operations are geographically dispersed in oil and gas exploration and development areas throughout the world.  Although rigs can be moved from one region to another, the cost of moving rigs and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to fluctuate somewhat between regions.  Still, significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility.  Our fleet operates in a single, global market for the provision of contract drilling services.  The location of our rigs and the allocation of resources to operate, build or upgrade our rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our customers. 

Significant Events 

Transocean Partners   On July 31, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Transocean Partners and two of our wholly owned subsidiaries.  Upon the closing of the merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Transocean Partners will merge with one of our subsidiaries, with Transocean Partners continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Transocean Ltd.  Each of the Transocean Partners common units that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing, other than units held by Transocean and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive 1.1427 of our shares.  We expect to issue approximately 22.7 million shares from conditional capital to complete the merger.  No Transocean shareholder vote will be required to complete the merger. 

The merger has been approved by a special committee of our board of directors, by the Transocean Partners board of directors and the Transocean Partners conflicts committee, and by the boards of directors of our subsidiary companies that are parties to the Merger Agreement.  Consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by the unitholders of Transocean Partners and other customary closing conditions.  On October 4, 2016, Transocean Partners announced that it would convene a special meeting of its common unitholders to approve the Merger Agreement with us.  The meeting, which will be open to unitholders of record as of September 22, 2016, will be held on November 11, 2016.  If it is approved, we expect that the closing of the merger will take place in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Debt issuance   On July 21, 2016, we completed an offering of an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion of 9.00% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2023 (the  9.00% Senior Notes ), and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $1.21 billion, net of initial  discount and estimated costs payable by us.  On October 19, 2016, we completed an offering of an aggregate principal amount of $600 million of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 15, 2024 (the  Senior Secured Notes ), and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $583 million, net of initial discount and estimated costs payable by us.  See   Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and uses of liquidity.  

Debt tender offer   On August 1, 2016, we completed a tender offer (the  Tender Offer ) to purchase for cash up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.50% Senior Notes due November 2020, 6.375% Senior Notes due December 2021 and 3.8% Senior Notes due October 2022 (collectively, the  Tendered Notes ).  In connection with the Tender Offer, we received valid tenders from holders of an aggregate principal amount of $981 million of the Tendered Notes, and we made an aggregate cash payment of $876 million to settle the Tendered Notes.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of the retirement of the Tendered Notes, we recognized an aggregate gain of $104 million associated with the retirement of debt.  See   Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and uses of liquidity.  

Debt repurchases   In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed the settlements of transactions to repurchase in the open market an aggregate principal amount of $365 million of our debt securities for an aggregate cash payment of $320 million.  As a result, we recognized an aggregate gain of $44 million associated with the retirement of debt.  See   Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and uses of liquidity.

Dispositions   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed the sale of a deepwater floater     and five midwater floaters  ,    along with related equipment.  In connection with the sale of these assets, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $11 million, and we recognized an aggregate net gain of $8 million.  See   Liquidity and Capital Resources Drilling fleet.  

Impairments of long lived assets   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we committed to a plan to sell for scrap value a deepwater floater     and three midwater floaters along with related equipment.  As a result, we recognized an aggregate loss of $34 million ($31 million, net of tax) associated with the impairment of these assets.  In October 2016, we committed to a plan to sell for scrap value the midwater floater   Sedco 704   along with related equipment.  See   Liquidity and Capital Resources Drilling fleet.  

Norway tax investigations and trial   In January 2016, the Norwegian authorities formally and unconditionally dropped all criminal charges against our subsidiaries and the two employees of our former external advisors and our former external Norwegian attorney.  As a result, no criminal charges remain outstanding for any of the previously reported Norway tax investigations or trials and all our subsidiaries and external advisors have been fully acquitted of all criminal charges. 

Markets for our shares   Our shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol  RIG  and were previously listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange ( SIX ) under the symbol  RIGN.   Effective March 31, 2016, our shares were delisted from the SIX. 

Par value reduction   On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the reduction of the par value of each of our shares to CHF 0.10 from the original par value of CHF 15.00.  The reduction of par value became effective as of January 7, 2016 upon registration in the commercial register. 

Outlook 

Drilling market   Our long term view of the offshore drilling market remains positive, particularly for high specification assets.  However, although commodity pricing has improved over the past quarter, our customers continue to focus on cost reduction and remain disciplined with respect to allocation of capital.  As such, we expect them to continue to limit spending on exploration and development opportunities into 2017.  The risks of project delays, contract renegotiations and contract terminations are also expected to persist in the near term.  Additionally, as a result of the challenging hydrocarbon price environment, we  have seen an increased number of requests for nonstandard contractual terms and concessions, including extended payment terms.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, our customers early terminated or cancelled contracts for   Discoverer Americas  ,    Polar Pioneer  ,    Sedco 714, Sedco Energy   and   Transocean Spitsbergen  .  Then, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received notices of early termination or cancellation of drilling contracts for   Deepwater Champion  ,    Deepwater Millennium, Discoverer Deep Seas  ,    GSF Constellation II, GSF Development Driller I   and   Transocean John Shaw  .  In October 2016, we received a notice of early termination of the drilling contract for   Discoverer India  . 

As expected, few new contracts have been awarded year to date, and this trend is likely to continue through the remainder of 2016, resulting in falling rig utilization rates and exacerbating the negative pressure on rig pricing.  Over time, we believe the oversupply of oil will decrease as the current supply and demand imbalance narrows.  As spare oil capacity diminishes, we expect upward pressure on commodity pricing with subsequent increased demand for drilling rigs.  As of October 24, 2016, our contract backlog was $12.2 billion compared to $13.7 billion as of July 21, 2016. 

Fleet status   We present the availability of our rigs in terms of the uncommitted fleet rate.  The uncommitted fleet rate is defined as the number of uncommitted days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage.  An uncommitted day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is idle or stacked, is not contracted to a customer and is not committed to a shipyard.  The uncommitted fleet rates exclude the effect of priced options. 

As of October 24, 2016, uncommitted fleet rates for the remainder of 2016 and each of the subsequent four years in the period ending December 31, 2020 were as follows:

Performance and Other Key Indicators 

Contract backlog   Contract backlog is defined as the maximum contractual operating dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining in the firm contract period, excluding revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation or other incentive provisions, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling revenues.  The contract backlog represents the maximum contract drilling revenues that can be earned considering the contractual operating dayrate in effect during the firm contract period and represents the basis for the maximum revenues in our revenue efficiency measurement.  To determine maximum revenues for purposes of calculating revenue efficiency, however, we include the revenues earned for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, other incentive provisions or cost escalation provisions which are excluded from the amounts presented for contract backlog.  The contract backlog for our fleet was as follows: 

Our contract backlog includes only firm commitments, which are represented by signed drilling contracts or, in some cases, by other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution.  Our contract backlog includes amounts associated with our newbuild units that are currently under construction.  The contractual operating dayrate may be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive or an alternative contractual dayrate, such as a waiting on weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate, may apply under certain circumstances.  The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations.  In certain contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated period of time. 

In October 2016, we received a notice of early termination of the drilling contract for   Discoverer India,   effective December 2016.  As a result of this termination, our contract backlog for ultra deepwater floaters presented as of October 24, 2016 reflects a reduction of approximately $760 million to remove the backlog related to this contract. 

Average daily revenue   Average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenues earned per operating day.  An operating day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period after commencement of operations.  The average daily revenue for our fleet was as follows: 

Our average daily revenue fluctuates relative to market conditions and our revenue efficiency.  The average daily revenue may also be affected by revenues for lump sum bonuses or demobilization fees received from our customers.  Our total fleet average daily revenue is also affected by the mix of rig classes being operated, as deepwater floaters, midwater floaters and high specification jackups are typically contracted at lower dayrates compared to ultra deepwater floaters and harsh environment floaters.  We include newbuilds in the calculation when the rigs commence operations upon acceptance by the customer.  We remove rigs from the calculation upon disposal, classification as held for sale or classification as discontinued operations.

Revenue efficiency   Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by the maximum revenue calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage.  Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest amount of contract drilling revenues the drilling unit could earn for the measurement period, excluding amounts related to incentive provisions.  The revenue efficiency rates for our fleet were as follows: 

Our revenue efficiency rate varies due to revenues earned under alternative contractual dayrates, such as a waiting on weather rate, repair rate, standby rate, force majeure rate or zero rate, that may apply under certain circumstances.  We include newbuilds in the calculation when the rigs commence operations upon acceptance by the customer.  We exclude rigs that are not operating under contract, such as those that are stacked. 

In the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenue efficiency for our fleet exceeded maximum revenues primarily as a result of achieving higher performance, earning certain contractual incentive bonuses and collecting previously deferred revenues. 

Rig utilization   Rig utilization is defined as the total number of operating days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage.  The rig utilization rates for our fleet were as follows: 

Our rig utilization rate declines as a result of idle and stacked rigs and during shipyard and mobilization periods to the extent these rigs are not earning revenues.  We include newbuilds in the calculation when the rigs commence operations upon acceptance by the customer.  We remove rigs from the calculation upon disposal, classification as held for sale or classification as discontinued operations.  Accordingly, our rig utilization can increase when idle or stacked units are removed from our drilling fleet.

Operating Results 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 

The following is an analysis of our operating results.  See   Performance and Other Key Indicators  for definitions of operating days, average daily revenue, revenue efficiency and rig utilization. 

n/m  means not meaningful. 

Operating revenues   Contract drilling revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $485 million of decreased revenues resulting from additional rigs idle or stacked, (b) approximately $205 million of decreased revenues resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale and (c) approximately $90 million of decreased revenues resulting from lower dayrates.  These decreases were partially offset by the following: (a) approximately $90 million of increased revenues associated with our newbuild ultra deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and (b) approximately $40 million of increased revenues resulting from improved revenue efficiency. 

Other revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to approximately $19 million of decreased revenues for reimbursable items. 

Costs and expenses   Operating and maintenance costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $280 million of decreased costs and expenses resulting from cost reductions related to our idle or stacked rigs, (b) approximately $125 million of decreased costs and expenses resulting from our active fleet primarily related to optimized maintenance and shipyard expenses, reduced materials and supplies obsolescence and reduced personnel costs, (c) approximately $65 million of decreased costs and expenses resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale and (d) approximately $50 million of reduced onshore costs.  These decreases were partially offset by the following: (a) approximately $25 million of increased costs and expenses associated with our newbuild ultra deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and (b) $21 million of costs and expenses related to the   Transocean Winner   grounding incident.

Depreciation expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to our newbuild ultra deepwater drillships and other property and equipment that were placed into service subsequent to September 30, 2015. 

Other income and expense   Gain on retirement of debt increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an agrregate gain of $104 million resulting from the completion of our tender offer of up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of our debt securities. 

Income tax expense   We operate internationally and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in the countries in which we operate and earn income.  In the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 21.2 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense, after excluding certain items, such as losses on impairment and gains and losses on certain asset disposals.  The tax effect, if any, of the excluded items as well as settlements of prior year tax liabilities and changes in prior year tax estimates are all treated as discrete period tax expenses or benefits.  In the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the various discrete period tax items was a net tax benefit of $38 million and $9 million, respectively.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, these discrete tax items, coupled with the excluded income and expense items noted above, resulted in an effective tax rate of (3.8) percent and 4.9 percent, respectively, based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense. 

The relationship between our provision for or benefit from income taxes and our income before income taxes can vary significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) the overall level of income before income taxes, (b) changes in the blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues versus income before taxes, (c) rig movements between taxing jurisdictions and (d) our rig operating structures.  Generally, our annual marginal tax rate is lower than our annual effective tax rate.  Consequently, our income tax expense does not change proportionally with our income before income taxes.  Significant decreases in our income before income taxes typically lead to higher effective tax rates, while significant increases in income before income taxes can lead to lower effective tax rates, subject to the other factors impacting income tax expense noted above.  With respect to the annual effective tax rate calculation for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a significant portion of our income tax expense was generated in countries in which income taxes are imposed on gross revenues, with the most significant of these countries being Angola.  Conversely, the countries in which we incurred the most significant income taxes during this period that were based on income before income tax include Norway, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S. 

Our rig operating structures further complicate our tax calculations, especially in instances where we have more than one operating structure for the particular taxing jurisdiction and, thus, more than one method of calculating taxes depending on the operating structure utilized by the rig under the contract.  For example, two rigs operating in the same country could generate significantly different provisions for income taxes if they are owned by two different subsidiaries that are subject to differing tax laws and regulations in the respective country of incorporation.

The following is an analysis of our operating results.  See   Performance and Other Key Indicators  for definitions of operating days, average daily revenue, revenue efficiency and rig utilization. 

n/m  means not meaningful. 

Operating revenues     Contract drilling revenues decreased for the nine months ended   September 30  , 2016 compared to the nine months ended   September 30  , 2015 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $1.8 billion of decreased revenues resulting from additional rigs idle or stacked, (b) approximately $590 million of decreased revenues resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale and (c) approximately $245 million of decreased revenues resulting from lower dayrates, partially offset by (d) approximately $180 million of increased revenues associated with our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other revenues increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to approximately $161 million of increased revenues resulting from drilling contracts early terminated or cancelled by our customers, partially offset by approximately $73 million of decreased revenues for reimbursable items. 

Costs and expenses   Excluding the effect of $788 million resulting from cost reimbursements from settlements, recoveries from insurance and net adjustments to contingent liabilities associated with the Macondo well incident in the prior year period, operating and maintenance costs and expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 by approximately $1.4 billion.  These decreases were primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $830 million of decreased costs and expenses resulting from cost reductions for rigs idle or stacked, (b) approximately $270 million of decreased costs and expenses resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale, (c) approximately $205 million of decreased costs and expenses for our active fleet primarily related to optimized maintenance and shipyard expenses, reduced materials and supplies obsolescence and reduced personnel costs and (d) approximately $125 million of onshore cost reductions.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $55 million of increased costs and expenses associated with our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $86 million of decreased depreciation resulting from the impairment of our deepwater floater and midwater floater asset groups in the year ended December 31, 2015 and (b) approximately $40 million of

decreased depreciation resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $50 million of increased depreciation associated with our two newbuild ultra deepwater drillships and other property and equipment placed into service subsequent to September 30, 2015. 

Impairments   In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a loss of $34 million associated with the impairment of certain assets classified as held for sale.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a loss on impairment related to the following: (a) a loss of $507 million associated with the impairment of our deepwater floater asset group, (b) a loss of $668 million associated with the impairment of our midwater floater asset group and (c) an aggregate loss of $664 million associated with the impairment of certain assets classified as held for sale. 

Other income and expense   Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $121 million of decreased interest expense resulting from debt retired in connection with our tender offer, repurchases and redemptions and (b) approximately $40 million of increased interest capitalized in connection with our newbuild construction program, partially offset by (c) approximately $87 million of increased interest expense resulting from interest rate increases in connection with downgrades to the credit rating for our senior unsecured long term debt and (d) approximately $23 million of increased interest expense resulting from issuance of new debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Gain on retirement of debt increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the following: (a) an aggregate gain of $104 million resulting from the completion of our tender offer of up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of our debt securities and (b) an aggregate gain of $44 million resulting from our repurchases of $365 million aggregate principal amount of our debt securities. 

Income tax expense   We operate internationally and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in the countries in which we operate and earn income.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 21.5 percent and 18.0 percent, respectively, based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense, after excluding certain items, such as losses on impairment and gains and losses on certain asset disposals.  The tax effect, if any, of the excluded items as well as settlements of prior year tax liabilities and changes in prior year tax estimates are all treated as discrete period tax expenses or benefits.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the various discrete period tax items was a net tax benefit of $34 million and $9 million, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, these discrete tax items, coupled with the excluded income and expense items noted above, resulted in an effective tax rate of 12.3 percent and 40.3 percent, respectively, based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to calculate our estimated effective income tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 21.5 percent in accordance with accounting standards for the provision of income taxes, we excluded certain operating losses in taxable jurisdictions for which we do not expect to realize a tax benefit.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our estimated effective income tax rate, excluding discrete items, would have been 22.7 percent if we had included all jurisdictions in our calculations. 

The relationship between our provision for or benefit from income taxes and our income before income taxes can vary significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) the overall level of income before income taxes, (b) changes in the blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues versus income before taxes, (c) rig movements between taxing jurisdictions and (d) our rig operating structures.  Generally, our annual marginal tax rate is lower than our annual effective tax rate.  Consequently, our income tax expense does not change proportionally with our income before income taxes.  Significant decreases in our income before income taxes typically lead to higher effective tax rates, while significant increases in income before income taxes can lead to lower effective tax rates, subject to the other factors impacting income tax expense noted above.  With respect to the annual effective tax rate calculation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a significant portion of our income tax expense was generated in countries in which income taxes are imposed on gross revenues, with the most significant of these countries being Angola.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources and uses of cash 

At September 30, 2016, we had $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our primary sources of cash were our cash flows from operating activities, including cash proceeds from customers that executed early terminations or cancellations of drilling contracts; net proceeds from the issuance of debt and net proceeds from restricted cash investments.  Our primary uses of cash were capital expenditures, primarily associated with our newbuild construction projects, settlement of the Tendered Notes, debt repurchased in the open market and payment of scheduled installments for our Macondo well incident settlement obligations. 

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to reduced operating activities, partially offset by cash proceeds of $663 million received in the prior year period associated with insurance recoveries with no comparable activity in the current year period, cash proceeds of $349 million received from customers in the current year period for early terminations or cancellations of drilling contracts with no comparable activity in the prior year period, and decreased cash payments of $200 million for scheduled installments for our Macondo well incident settlement obligations. 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to reduced capital expenditures, primarily associated with milestone payments for our major construction projects and other shipyard projects. 

Net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to the receipt of net cash proceeds from issuance of the 9.0% Senior Notes with no comparable activity in the prior year period and cash used to pay our shareholders installments of distributions of qualifying additional paid in capital in the prior year period with no comparable activity in the current year period.

Expansion   From time to time, we review possible acquisitions of businesses and drilling rigs and may make significant future capital commitments for such purposes.  We may also consider investments related to major rig upgrades, new rig construction, or the acquisition of a rig under construction.  We may commit to such investment without first obtaining customer contracts.  Any acquisition, upgrade or new rig construction could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash or the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares or other securities.  Our failure to secure drilling contracts for rigs under construction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made capital expenditures of $1.1 billion, including capitalized interest of $130 million.  The historical and projected capital expenditures and other capital additions for our recently completed and ongoing major construction projects were as follows: 

(a) 

The ultra deepwater floaters   Deepwater Thalassa   and   Deepwater Proteus   were placed into service     and commenced operations in February 2016 and May 2016, respectively.  In the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect to take delivery of additional equipment, ordered but not yet received.     

(b) 

Deepwater Conqueror  , a newbuild ultra deepwater drillship under construction at the Daewoo Shipbuilding   Marine Engineering Co. Ltd. shipyard in Korea, is expected to commence operations in the first quarter of 2017.     

(c) 

Deepwater Pontus   and   Deepwater Poseidon  , two newbuild ultra deepwater drillships under construction at the Daewoo Shipbuilding   Marine Engineering Co. Ltd. shipyard in Korea, are expected to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, respectively.     

(d) 

Transocean Cassiopeia  ,    Transocean Centaurus  ,    Transocean Cepheus  ,    Transocean Cetus   and   Transocean Circinus  , five Keppel FELS Super B 400 Bigfoot class design newbuild high specification jackups under construction at Keppel FELS  shipyard in Singapore do not yet have drilling contracts and are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2020, the second quarter of 2020, the third quarter of 2020, the fourth quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively.  The delivery expectations and the cost projections presented above reflect the terms of our construction agreements, as amended to delay delivery in consideration of current market conditions.     

(e) 

Our two unnamed dynamically positioned ultra deepwater drillships under construction at the Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd. in Singapore do not yet have drilling contracts and are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2020, respectively.  The delivery expectations and the cost projections presented above reflect the terms of our construction agreements, as amended to delay delivery in consideration of current market conditions.     

The ultimate amount of our capital expenditures is partly dependent upon financial market conditions, the actual level of operational and contracting activity, the costs associated with the current regulatory environment and customer requested capital improvements and equipment for which the customer agrees to reimburse us.  As with any major shipyard project that takes place over an extended period of time, the actual costs, the timing of expenditures and the project completion date may vary from estimates based on numerous factors, including actual contract terms, weather, exchange rates, shipyard labor conditions, availability of suppliers to recertify equipment and the market demand for components and resources required for drilling unit construction.  We intend to fund the cash requirements relating to our capital expenditures through available cash balances, cash generated from operations and asset sales.  We also have available credit under a $3.0 billion unsecured five year revolving credit facility, as described below, and may utilize other commercial bank or capital market financings.  Economic conditions could impact the availability of these sources of funding. 

Dispositions   From time to time, we may also review the possible disposition of non strategic drilling units.  Considering recent market conditions, we have committed to plans to sell certain lower specification drilling units for scrap value.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we identified four such drilling units that we have sold or intend to sell for scrap value.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified 22 such drilling units that we have sold for scrap value.  We continue to evaluate the drilling units in our fleet and may identify additional lower specification drilling units to be sold for scrap value.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed the sale of one deepwater floater and five midwater floaters, along with related equipment, and we received net cash proceeds of $11 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed the sale of two ultra deepwater floaters, six deepwater floaters and nine midwater floaters, along with related equipment, and we received aggregate net cash proceeds of $35 million. 

Sources and uses of liquidity 

Overview   We expect to use existing cash balances, internally generated cash flows, proceeds from our debt offering, proceeds from the disposal of assets, borrowings under our bank credit agreement or proceeds from the issuance of additional debt to fulfill anticipated obligations, such as capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities or other payments, such as payments in connection with our Tender Offer (see  Debt tender offer ), repayment of debt due within one year, payments of our Macondo well incident settlement obligations, working capital and other needs in our operations.  We may also consider establishing additional credit facilities under credit agreements.  Subject in each case to then existing market conditions and to our then expected liquidity needs, among other factors, we may continue to use a portion of our internally generated cash flows to reduce debt prior to scheduled maturities through debt repurchases, either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, or through debt redemptions or tender offers.  From time to time, we may also use borrowings under our bank credit agreement to maintain liquidity for short term cash needs. 

Our access to debt and equity markets may be limited due to a variety of events, including, among others, credit rating agency downgrades of our debt ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, three credit rating agencies downgraded their credit ratings of our non credit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt ( Debt Rating ) to Debt Ratings that are below investment grade.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, three of the credit rating agencies further downgraded our Debt Rating.  Such downgrades have caused, and any further downgrades may cause, us to experience increased fees under our credit facility and interest rates under agreements governing certain of our senior notes and may limit our ability to access debt markets.  Our ability to access such markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  An economic downturn could have an impact on the lenders participating in our credit facilities or on our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. 

Our internally generated cash flow is directly related to our business and the market sectors in which we operate.  Should the drilling market continue to deteriorate, or should we experience poor results in our operations, cash flow from operations may be reduced.  We have, however, continued to generate positive cash flow from operating activities over recent years and expect that such cash flow will continue to be positive over the next year. 

Debt issuance   On July 21, 2016, we completed an offering of an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion of the 9.00% Senior Notes, and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $1.21 billion, net of initial discount and estimated costs payable by us.  We used the majority of the net proceeds from the debt offering to complete the Tender Offer (see  Debt tender offer ).  We will pay interest on the 9.00% Senior Notes semiannually on January 15 and July 15 each year, beginning on January 15, 2017. 

On October 19, 2016, we completed an offering of an aggregate principal amount of $600 million of the Senior Secured Notes, and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $583 million, net of initial discount and estimated costs payable by us.  We will pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2017.  Additionally, on each interest payment date, we will be required to redeem, on a pro rata basis an aggregate principal amount of $30 million of the notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount. 

Debt tender offer   On August 1, 2016, we completed the Tender Offer to purchase for cash up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Tendered Notes.  As a result of the Tender Offer, we received valid tenders from holders of an aggregate principal amount of $981 million of the Tendered Notes, and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made an aggregate cash payment of $876 million to settle the Tendered Notes. 

Debt repurchases and redemptions   In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased in the open market an aggregate principal amount of $365 million of our debt securities for an aggregate cash payment of $320 million.  In the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased in the open market an aggregate principal amount of $503 million of certain of our debt securities for an aggregate cash payment of $468 million.  On July 30, 2015, we redeemed the remaining aggregate principal amount of $893 million of the 4.95% Senior Notes due November 2015 for an aggregate cash payment of $904 million. 

Distributions of qualifying additional paid in capital   In May 2015, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the distribution of qualifying additional paid in capital in the form of a U.S. dollar denominated dividend of $0.60 per outstanding share, payable in four quarterly installments of $0.15 per outstanding share, subject to certain limitations.  In May 2015, we recognized a liability of $218 million for the distribution payable, recorded in other current liabilities, with a corresponding entry to additional paid in capital.  On June 17 and September 23, 2015, we paid the first two installments in the aggregate amount of $109 million to shareholders of record as of May 29 and August 25, 2015.  On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the cancellation of the third and fourth installments of the distribution.

limitations.  On March 18, 2015, we paid the final installment in the aggregate amount of $272 million to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2015. 

Litigation settlements and insurance recoveries   On May 20, 2015, we entered into a confidential settlement agreement with BP plc (together with its affiliates,  BP ) to settle various disputes remaining between the parties with respect to the Macondo well incident.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we received from BP a cash payment of $125 million in July 2015 to partially reimburse us for legal fees that we incurred.  Additionally, in connection with the settlement, BP agreed to discontinue its attempts to recover as an additional insured under our liability insurance program.  As a result, we submitted claims to our insurers and, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we received aggregate cash proceeds of $538 million from insurance for recovery of previously incurred losses. 

On May 29, 2015, together with the Plaintiffs  Steering Committee (the  PSC ), we filed a settlement agreement (the  PSC Settlement Agreement ) in which we agreed to pay a total of $212 million, plus up to $25 million for partial reimbursement of attorneys  fees, to resolve (1) punitive damages claims of private plaintiffs, businesses, and local governments and (2) certain claims that BP had made against us and had assigned to private plaintiffs who previously settled economic damages claims against BP.  The PSC Settlement Agreement is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the  MDL Court ) and acceptance by a minimum number of plaintiffs.  In June 2016 and August 2015, we made a cash deposit of $25 million and $212 million, respectively, into an escrow account pending approval of the settlement by the MDL Court.  As of October 25, 2016, the balance of our escrow account was $237 million. 

Effective October 13, 2015, we finalized a settlement agreement with the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively, the  States ), pursuant to which the States agreed to release all of their claims against us arising from the Macondo well incident.  On October 22, 2015, we made an aggregate cash payment of $35 million to the States. 

Pursuant to a cooperation guilty plea agreement by and among the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and certain of our affiliates (the  Plea Agreement ), which was accepted by the court on February 14, 2013, we agreed to pay a criminal fine of $100 million and to consent to the entry of an order requiring us to pay $150 million to the National Fish   Wildlife Foundation and $150 million to the National Academy of Sciences in scheduled installments through February 2017.  In each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we made aggregate cash payments of $60 million.  The final installment of $60 million is due on or before February 14, 2017. 

Pursuant to a civil consent decree by and among the DOJ and certain of our affiliates ( the Consent Decree ), which was approved by the court on February 19, 2013, we agreed to pay a civil penalty totaling $1.0 billion, plus interest at a fixed rate of 2.15 percent.  In the three months ended March 31, 2015, we paid the final installment of $204 million, including interest. 

Revolving credit facility   In June 2014, we entered into an amended and restated bank credit agreement, which established a $3.0 billion unsecured five year revolving credit facility, that is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019 (the  Five Year Revolving Credit Facility ).  Among other things, the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility includes limitations on creating liens, incurring subsidiary debt, transactions with affiliates, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and the sale of substantially all assets.  The Five Year Revolving Credit Facility also includes a covenant imposing a maximum debt to tangible capitalization ratio of 0.6 to 1.0.  At September 30, 2016, our debt to tangible capitalization ratio, as defined, was 0.4 to 1.0.  In order to borrow or have letters of credit issued under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility, we must, at the time of the borrowing request, not be in default under the bank credit agreements and make certain representations and warranties, including with respect to compliance with laws and solvency, to the lenders, but we are not required to make any representation to the lenders as to the absence of a material adverse effect.  Repayment of borrowings under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default.  We are also subject to various covenants under the indentures pursuant to which our public debt was issued, including restrictions on creating liens, engaging in sale/leaseback transactions and engaging in certain merger, consolidation or reorganization transactions.  A default under our public debt indentures, our capital lease contract or any other debt owed to unaffiliated entities that exceeds $125 million could trigger a default under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility and, if not waived by the lenders, could cause us to lose access to the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility. 

We may borrow under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (the  Five Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin ), which ranges from 1.125 percent to 2.0 percent based on the Debt Rating, or (2) the base rate specified in the credit agreement plus the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin, less one percent per annum.  Throughout the term of the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility, we pay a facility fee on the daily unused amount of the underlying commitment which ranges from 0.15 percent to 0.35 percent depending on our Debt Rating.  At October 25, 2016, based on our Debt Rating on that date, the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin was 2.0 percent and the facility fee was 0.35 percent.  At October 25, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding, no letters of credit issued, and $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility. 

Noncontrolling interest   In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Transocean Partners declared and paid an aggregate distribution of $74 million, of which $21 million was paid to the holders of noncontrolling interest.  In the year ended December 31, 2015, Transocean Partners declared and paid an aggregate distribution of $100 million to its unitholders, of which $29 million was paid to the holders of noncontrolling interest. 

On November 4, 2015, Transocean Partners announced that its board of directors approved a unit repurchase program, authorizing it to repurchase up to $40 million of its publicly held common units.  Subject to market conditions, Transocean Partners may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  It may suspend or discontinue the program at

any time.  The Merger Agreement restricts Transocean Partners  ability to repurchase its common units without our consent, and no such repurchases have been made since entering into the agreement.  The common units repurchased under the program will be cancelled.  As of October 25, 2016, Transocean Partners had repurchased 478,376 of its publicly held common units for an aggregate purchase price of $4 million.  At October 25, 2016, we held a 71.3 percent limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners. 

Share repurchase program   In May 2009, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved and authorized our board of directors, at its discretion, to repurchase an amount of our shares for cancellation with an aggregate purchase price of up to CHF 3.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $3.6 billion.  On February 12, 2010, our board of directors authorized our management to implement the share repurchase program.  At December 31, 2015, we held 2.9 million of our shares.  On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the cancellation of all shares that have been repurchased to date under our share repurchase program.  The shares repurchased under our share repurchase program were cancelled as of January 7, 2016 upon registration of the cancellation in the commercial register.  In the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not purchase any shares under our share repurchase program. 

Based upon our ongoing capital requirements, the price of our shares, regulatory and tax considerations, cash flow generation, the amount and duration of our contract backlog, general market conditions, debt ratings considerations and other factors, we may elect to retain cash, reduce debt, make capital investments or acquisitions or otherwise use cash for general corporate purposes, and consequently, we may elect not to repurchase any additional shares under this program.  Decisions regarding the amount, if any, and timing of any share repurchases will be made from time to time based upon these factors.  Any repurchased shares under the share repurchase program would be held by us for cancellation by the shareholders at a future general meeting of shareholders.  At October 25, 2016, the authorization remaining under the share repurchase program was for the repurchase of up to CHF 3.2 billion, equivalent to approximately $3.3 billion, of our outstanding shares.

Contingencies and Uncertainties 

Macondo well incident 

On April 22, 2010, the ultra deepwater floater   Deepwater Horizon   sank after a blowout of the Macondo well caused a fire and explosion on the rig off the coast of Louisiana.  At the time of the explosion,   Deepwater Horizon   was contracted to BP.  Litigation commenced shortly after the incident, and most claims against us were consolidated by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and transferred to the MDL Court.  A significant portion of the contingencies arising from the Macondo well incident has now been resolved as a result of settlements with the DOJ, BP, the PSC and the States.  We believe the remaining most notable claims against us arising from the Macondo well incident are the 36  settlement class opt outs from the PSC Settlement Agreement.  We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the remaining claims arising from the Macondo well incident, the timing of any upcoming appeal or further rulings, or that we will not enter into additional settlements as to some or all of the remaining matters related to the Macondo well incident.  See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 11 Contingencies. 

Tax matters 

We conduct operations through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.  Each country has its own tax regimes with varying nominal rates, deductions and tax attributes.  From time to time, we may identify changes to previously evaluated tax positions that could result in adjustments to our recorded assets and liabilities.  In March 2016, the U.K. publicly announced its 2016 Budget and Finance Bill.  These initial tax reform proposals included measures that would deny tax deductions or require inclusion of taxable income for certain cross border structure arrangements and transactions.  On September 15, 2016, the final 2016 Finance Act received Royal Assent and was enacted into law.  The tax reforms in the initial proposals that could have resulted in a higher effective tax rate and increased tax costs due to our controlling interest in Transocean Partners were not included in the final 2016 Finance Act. 

We file federal and local tax returns in several jurisdictions throughout the world.  Tax authorities in certain jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and in some cases have issued assessments.  We are defending our tax positions in those jurisdictions.  While   

-  34  -

we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect the ultimate liability to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations, although it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows.  See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Income Taxes. 

Regulatory matters 

For a description of regulatory and environmental matters relating to the Macondo well     incident, please see   Macondo well incident.  

Other matters 

In addition, from time to time, we receive inquiries from governmental regulatory agencies regarding our operations around the world, including inquiries with respect to various tax, environmental, regulatory and compliance matters.  To the extent appropriate under the circumstances, we investigate such matters, respond to such inquiries and cooperate with the regulatory agencies.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

We are exposed to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk, primarily associated with our long term and short term debt, our restricted cash balances and investments and our international operations.  For a discussion of our interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk, see  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to these previously reported matters during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures    

Disclosure controls and procedures   We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the  United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), Rules 13a 15 and 15d 15, were effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (1) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

Internal control over financial reporting   There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings    

We have certain actions, claims and other matters pending as discussed and reported in  Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies  and  Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contingencies and Uncertainties Macondo well incident  in our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  We are also involved in various tax matters as described in  Part II. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Income Taxes  and in  Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contingencies and Uncertainties Tax matters  in our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  All such actions, claims, tax and other matters are incorporated herein by reference. 

As of September 30, 2016, we were also involved in a number of other lawsuits, claims and disputes, which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and for which we do not expect the liability, if any, to have a material adverse effect on our current consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the matters referred to above or of any such other pending or threatened litigation or legal proceedings.  There can be no assurance that our beliefs or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any lawsuit or claim or dispute will prove correct and the eventual outcome of these matters could materially differ from management s current estimates. 

In addition to the legal proceedings described above, we may from time to time identify other matters that we monitor through our compliance program and in response to events arising generally within our industry and in the markets where we do business.  For example, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we began investigating statements made by a former employee of Petr leo Brasileiro S.A. ( Petrobras ) related to the award to us of a drilling services contract in Brazil.  These statements were made in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation by the Brazilian authorities into Petrobras and certain other companies and individuals.  We have completed our internal investigation, and we have not identified any wrongdoing by any of our employees or agents in connection with our business.  We have voluntarily met with governmental authorities in the United States to discuss the statements made by the former Petrobras employee and our internal investigation as well as our findings.  We will continue to investigate these types of allegations and cooperate with governmental authorities.  Through the process of monitoring and proactive investigation, we strive to ensure no violation of our policies, Code of Integrity or law has, or will, occur; however, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters.

In May 2009, at the annual general meeting of Transocean Ltd., our shareholders approved and authorized our board of directors, at its discretion, to repurchase an amount of our shares for cancellation with an aggregate purchase price of up to CHF 3.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $3.6 billion.

The Securities 

SECTION 2.01.          Form and Dating  .  Provisions relating to the Securities are set forth in Appendix A attached hereto (   Appendix A   ) which is hereby incorporated in, and expressly made part of, this Indenture.  The Securities and the Trustee s certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1.1 and Exhibit 1.2 to Appendix A, in the case of the 144A Global Securities and Regulation S Global Securities, respectively, which are hereby incorporated in, and expressly made a part of, this Indenture.  The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to which the Company is subject, if any, or usage (  provided   that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company).  Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.  The terms of the Securities set forth in Appendix A are part of the terms of this Indenture. 

SECTION 2.02.          Execution and Authentication  .  An Officer shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. 

If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless. 

A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security.  The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. 

The Trustee, upon a written order of the Company signed by an Officer of the Company, together with the other documents required by Sections 14.02 and 14.03, shall authenticate Securities for original issue on the Issue Date in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $600,000,000.  Such written order of the Company shall specify the amount of Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated. 

24 

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities.  Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so.  Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent.  An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands. 

SECTION 2.03.          Registrar and Paying Agent  .  The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the    Registrar   ) and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (the    Paying Agent   ).  The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange.  The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents.  The term  Paying Agent  includes any additional paying agent. 

If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate reasonable compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.06.  The Company may change the Paying Agent or Registrar without prior notice to the Holders.  The Company or any of its Affiliates incorporated or organized within The United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent. 

The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities. 

The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Securities. 

SECTION 2.04.          Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust  .  Prior to each due date of the principal of and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due.  The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders of Securities or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment.  If the Company or any of its Affiliates acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund.  The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent.  Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. 

SECTION 2.05.          Lists of Holders of Securities  .  The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders of Securities.  If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date with respect to Securities and at such other times as the Trustee may reasonably request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders of Securities. 

SECTION 2.06.          Transfer and Exchange  .  The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer.  When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar, if any, with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture (including Appendix A thereto) are met.  When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar, if any, with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. 

25 

The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depositary participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Definitive Security or Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof. 

Neither the Trustee nor any agent of the Trustee shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary. 

SECTION 2.07.          Replacement Securities  .  If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or either the Company or the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, the Company shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of evidence of authentication in accordance with Section 2.02, shall authenticate a replacement Security if the Trustee s requirements for replacement of Securities are met.  An indemnity bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced.  The Trustee and the Company each may charge such Holder for their expenses in replacing such Security. 

Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Securities duly issued hereunder. 

SECTION 2.08.          Outstanding Securities  .  Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding.   

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a protected purchaser (as defined in Section 8-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code). 

If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then   on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue. 

SECTION 2.09.          Temporary Securities  .  Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities.  Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities.  Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities. 

SECTION 2.10.            Cancellation                                        .  The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation.  The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment.  The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and dispose of (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation in accordance with its retention policy then in effect, unless  the Company directs the Trustee in writing to deliver canceled Securities to the Company.  The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. 

26

The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders of Securities on a subsequent special record date.  The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date;   provided   that no such special record date may be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest.   At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, upon written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company) will send to each Holder of Securities a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. 

(b)        If any Affiliate Financing (x) is consummated prior to the date that is three months after the Issue Date and (y) provides an All-In Yield at least 100 basis points higher than the All-In Yield of the Securities, then the interest rate of the Securities shall be automatically increased so that the All-In Yield of the Securities equals the All-In Yield of such Affiliate Financing. Within 30 days after the consummation of such Affiliate Financing, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent an Officer s Certificate  certifying  to (1) the satisfaction of the conditions specified in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), (2) the new interest rate and (3) to the effective date of such new interest rate.

SECTION 6.02.          Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment  .

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in  

56 

Section 6.01(f) or (g), the principal amount of all of the Securities, all interest thereon, and the Make-Whole Premium, if any, shall automatically and immediately become due and payable.    

For the avoidance of doubt, if the principal amount of the Securities is paid on or prior to October 15, 2020, the Make-Whole Premium provided under Section 3.08 hereof shall be paid, even if such payment is made following acceleration pursuant to this Section 6.02. The Company will pay the Make-Whole Premium, as compensation to the Holders for the loss of their investment opportunity and not as a penalty, whether or not an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(f) or (g) has occurred and (if an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(f) or (g) has occurred) without regard to whether the event causing such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary, or whether payment occurs pursuant to a motion, plan of reorganization, or otherwise, and without regard to whether the Securities and other Notes Obligations are satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether or not by power of judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means.  Any premium payable pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be presumed to be the liquidated damages sustained by each Holder as a result of the early repayment of the Securities and the Note Parties agree that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing.  EACH NOTE PARTY EXPRESSLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE MAKE-WHOLE PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION. The Company expressly agrees (to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so) that: (A) the Make-Whole Premium is reasonable and the product of an arm s length transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel; (B) the Make-Whole Premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time payment is made; (C) there has been a course of conduct between Holders and the Company giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the Make-Whole Premium; and (D) the Company shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this paragraph. The Company expressly acknowledges that its agreement to pay the Make-Whole Premium to the Trustee for the ratable benefit of the Holders as herein described is a material inducement to Holders to purchase the Securities. 

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: 

(1)        the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in U.S. dollars, 

(A)        all overdue interest, if any, on all Outstanding Securities, 

(B)        all unpaid principal of (and premium including the Make-Whole Premium, if any, on) any Outstanding Securities which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, and interest, if any, on such unpaid principal (and premium including the Make-Whole Premium, if any) at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, 

(C)        to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue interest, if any, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and 

(D)        all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and 

57 

(2)        all Events of Default with respect to Securities other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of (or premium including the Make-Whole Premium, if any, on) or interest on Securities which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.13. 

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. 

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in the event of a declaration of acceleration in respect of the Securities because of an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(f) or 6.01(g) shall have occurred and be continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically annulled if the Indebtedness that is the subject of such Event of Default has been discharged or otherwise paid in full. 

Upon the Trustee providing any declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof pursuant to this Section 6.02 with respect to Securities all or part of which is represented by a Global Security, a record date shall automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities entitled to join such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, which record date shall be the close of business on the date the Trustee shall have provided such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be.  The Holders of Outstanding Securities on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;   provided   that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having been obtained prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date (or their duly appointed agents), such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may by, shall automatically and without any action by any Person be cancelled and of no further effect.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder (or duly appointed agent thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration of such 90-day period, a declaration of acceleration, or a rescission and annulment of any such declaration, contrary to or different from a declaration previously given by a Holder, or from giving, after the expiration of such period, a declaration identical to a declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that has been cancelled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in any of which events a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.02.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name, as Trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated. 

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

(2)        to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payment to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.06. 

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. 

SECTION 6.05.          Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities  .

(3)        such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; 

(4)        the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and 

(5)        no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities; 

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing themselves of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not any such use by a Holder affects, disturbs or prejudices the rights of other Holders or obtains or seeks to obtain priority or preference over such other Holders or enforces any right under this Indenture).

SECTION 6.09.          Restoration of Rights and Remedies  .  If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. 

SECTION 6.10.          Rights and Remedies Cumulative  .  Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 2.07, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any such direction with respect to Securities all or part of which is represented by a Global Security, a record date shall automatically and without any further action by any Person be set for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities entitled to join in such direction, which record date shall be the close of business on the day the Trustee shall have received such direction.  The Holders of Outstanding Securities on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;   provided   that, unless such direction shall have become effective by virtue of Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities on such record date (or their duly appointed agents) having joined therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date, such direction shall  

61 

automatically and without any action by any Person be cancelled and of no further effect.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder (or a duly appointed agent of a Holder) from giving, before or after the expiration of such 90-day period, a direction contrary to or different from a direction previously given by a Holder, or from giving, after the expiration of such period, a direction identical to a direction that has been cancelled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in any of which events a new record date in respect thereof shall be set pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.12. 

SECTION 6.13.          Waiver of Past Defaults  .  Subject to Section 6.02, the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may on behalf of the Holders of all the Outstanding Securities waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder, except a default

(2)        in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article 10 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected. 

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder.  If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date (or their duly designated agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive any such default hereunder, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;   provided  , that unless such majority in principal amount shall have been obtained prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such waiver previously given shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect. 

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture and the other Note Documents; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 

SECTION 6.14.          Undertaking for Costs  .  All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys  fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder or group of Holders holding in the aggregate more than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium including the Make-Whole Premium, if any) or interest on any Security on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date). 

SECTION 6.15.          Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws  .  The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been  

62 

enacted;   provided   that this Section shall not prohibit the Company from exercising any rights it may have under this Indenture to contest any actions taken by the Trustee pursuant to this Section.

SECTION 7.03.          Individual Rights of Trustee  .  The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.

Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders. 

SECTION 7.06.          Compensation and Indemnity  .

The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity.  Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder or any of the Note Documents.  The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel.  The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to have been incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee s own willful misconduct or gross negligence. 

To secure the Company s and the Guarantors  payment obligations in this Section 7.06, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities. 

The Company s and the Guarantors  payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.  When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(f) or (g) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law or any similar federal, provincial, territorial or state law for the relief of debtors. 

SECTION 7.07.          Replacement of Trustee  .  The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company.  The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee with respect to the Securities by so notifying with 31 days prior notice to the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee.  The Company shall remove the Trustee if: 

(1)        the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.09; 

(2)        the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; 

(3)        a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or 

(4)        the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. 

If the Trustee resigns or is removed by the Company, or is removed by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. 

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company.  Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.  The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders of the Securities.  The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.06. 

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

Except as expressly set forth in Sections 9.01, 11.02 and 11.06, the obligations of each Guarantor of Securities hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor of Securities herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture with respect to the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity. 

Each Guarantor of Securities further agrees that its Securities Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise. 

In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder of Securities or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (A) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (B) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (C) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee. 

Each Guarantor of Securities agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of such Guarantor s Securities Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 11.01. 

Each Guarantor of Securities also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 11.01. 

SECTION 11.02.          Limitation on Liability  .  Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Guarantor of Securities shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. 

76 

SECTION 11.03.          Successors and Assigns  .  This Article 11 shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture. 

SECTION 11.04.          No Waiver  .  Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 11 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 11 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 

SECTION 11.05.          Modification  .  No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 11, nor the consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. 

SECTION 11.06.          Release of Certain Guarantors  .  (a) A Guarantor will be automatically released from its obligations under this Article 11:

SECTION 11.07.          Execution and Delivery  .  (a) To evidence its Securities Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by an officer, director, general manager or person holding an equivalent title. 

(b)        Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Securities Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the absence of the endorsement of any notation of such Securities Guarantee on the Securities. 

(c)        If the person whose signature is on this Indenture no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates any Security, the Securities Guarantees shall be valid nevertheless. 

77 

(d)        The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Securities Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.

SECTION 12.04.          Possession and Use of Collateral; No Impairment of the Security Interests  .

SECTION 12.05.          Collateral Agent  .  The Trustee and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Securities hereby authorize the appointment of the Collateral Agent as the Trustee s and the Holders  collateral agent under the Security Documents and in its capacity as mortgagee and security trustee pursuant to the Collateral Rig Mortgage, and the Trustee and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Securities hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Documents and to take such action on their behalf under the provisions of the Security Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Indenture and the Security Documents, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture and the Security Documents, the duties of the Collateral Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents to which the Collateral Agent is a party, nor shall the Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Guarantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Indenture and the Security Documents or otherwise exist against the Collateral Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term  agent  in this Indenture with reference to the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. 

The Trustee is authorized and directed by the Holders and the Holders by acquiring the Securities are deemed to have authorized the Trustee, as applicable, to cause the Collateral Agent to enter into and perform its obligations under the Security Documents.  The Collateral Agent is authorized and directed by the Trustee and the Holders and the Holders by acquiring the Securities are deemed to have authorized the Collateral Agent, to (i) enter into the Security Documents to which it is a party, (ii) bind the Trustee and the Holders on the terms as set forth in such Security Documents and (iii) perform and observe its obligations and exercise its rights and powers under such Security Documents, including entering into amendments, supplements and other modifications permitted by the terms of this Indenture or the Security  

79 

Documents.  Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Security, is deemed to have consented and agreed to the terms of each Security Document, as originally in effect and as amended, restated, replaced, supplemented or modified from time to time in accordance with its terms or the terms of this Indenture.  Each of the Holders by acquiring the Securities is hereby deemed to direct the Trustee to appoint the Collateral Agent as its mortgagee and security trustee to receive, hold, administer and enforce the Collateral Rig Mortgage covering the Collateral Rig, as contemplated under this Indenture. 

The Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless the Collateral Agent shall have received written notice from the Trustee or unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default is received by the Collateral Agent at the address specified in Section 14.01, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture.  The Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Trustee in accordance with Article 6 or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (subject to this Section 12.05). 

The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation and makes no representation whatsoever to the Trustee or any of the Holders as to the existence, genuineness, value or protection of the Collateral or the sufficiency of any Security Documents, or that the Collateral is owned by any of the Collateral Grantors or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Collateral Agent s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, maintained or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to determine whether all of the Collateral Grantor s property constituting Collateral intended to be subject to the Lien and security interest of the Security Documents has been properly and completely listed or delivered, as the case may be, or the genuineness, validity, marketability or sufficiency thereof or title thereto, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Indenture or any other Security Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, the Collateral Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to the Trustee or any Holder as to any of the foregoing.  The grant of permissive rights or powers to the Collateral Agent shall not be construed to impose duties to act.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall require the Collateral Agent to file financing statements or continuation statements, to record any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or be responsible for perfection or maintaining the perfection of the security interests purported to be created by the Security Documents and such responsibility shall be solely that of the Company. 

Each the Collateral Agent and the Trustee, each in its capacity as such, shall not be liable or responsible for the failure of the Company to maintain insurance on the Collateral, nor shall it be responsible for any loss due to the insufficiency of such insurance or by reason of the failure of any insurer to pay the full amount of any loss against which it may have insured to the Company, the Trustee, the Collateral Agent or any other Person.  The provisions of Article 7, mutatis mutandis, shall apply to the Collateral Agent. 

SECTION 12.06.          Replacement of Collateral Agent  .  The Collateral Agent may resign at any time by so notifying the Company.  The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove Collateral Agent with respect to the Securities by so notifying with 31 days prior notice to the Collateral Agent and may appoint a successor Collateral Agent.  The Company shall remove Collateral Agent if: 

(1)      the Collateral Agent is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; 

(2)      a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Collateral Agent or its property; or 

(3)      the Collateral Agent otherwise becomes incapable of acting. 

80 

If the Collateral Agent resigns or is removed by the Company, or is removed by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Collateral Agent, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Collateral Agent for any reason (the Collateral Agent in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Collateral Agent), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Collateral Agent. 

A successor Collateral Agent shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Collateral Agent and to the Company.  Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Collateral Agent shall become effective, and the successor Collateral Agent shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Collateral Agent under this Indenture.  The successor Collateral Agent shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders of the Securities.  The retiring Collateral Agent shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Collateral Agent to the successor Collateral Agent. 

If a successor Collateral Agent does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agent resigns or is removed, the retiring Collateral Agent or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent. 

SECTION 12.07.          Purchaser Protected  .  No purchaser or grantee of any property or rights purporting to be released from the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent shall be bound to ascertain the authority of the Collateral Agent or Trustee to execute the release or to inquire as to the existence of any conditions herein prescribed for the exercise of such authority so long as the conditions set forth in Section 12.02 have been satisfied. 

SECTION 12.08.          Authorization of Receipt of Funds by the Trustee Under the Security Documents  .  The Trustee is authorized to receive any funds for the benefit of Holders distributed under the Security Documents and to apply such funds as provided in Section 6.06. 

SECTION 12.09.          Powers Exercisable by Receiver or Trustee  .  In case the Collateral shall be in the possession of a receiver or trustee, lawfully appointed, the powers conferred in this Article 12 upon any Collateral Grantor, as applicable, with respect to the release, sale or other disposition of such property may be exercised by such receiver or trustee, and an instrument signed by such receiver or trustee shall be deemed the equivalent of any similar instrument of any Collateral Grantor, as applicable, or of any officer or officers thereof required by the provisions of this Article 12. 

SECTION 12.10.          Compensation and Indemnification  .  The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to the compensation and indemnification set forth in Section 7.06 (with the references to the Trustee therein being deemed to refer to and include the Collateral Agent). 

SECTION 12.11.          Form of Security Documents and Opinions      .  To the extent that any provision of this Indenture or Security Document requires the execution or delivery after the Issue Date of any Security Documents, agreements, certificates, opinions or other documents (including, without limitation, any such opinions or documents described in the definition of  Collateral and Guaranty Requirements ), in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, or other similar discretionary approval, or in substantially in the same form as such Security Documents, agreements, certificates, opinions or other documents were delivered on the Issue Date or as attached hereto by the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, the Holders, by acquiring the Securities, are deemed to have approved the form and substance of any such Security Documents, agreements, certificates, opinions or other documents in substantially the same form as those executed and delivered on the Issue Date, in each case, with such changes as may be appropriate to reflect the entity subject to or the subject of or the governing law of such Security Documents, agreements, certificates, opinions or other documents and the  

81 

jurisdiction of organization of such entity and hereby authorize the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to execute such documents and accept such documents and opinions.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 12.11 shall not supersede any requirement contained herein regarding the delivery of an Officer s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. 

Article 13     Additional Amounts 

SECTION 13.01.          Payment of Additional Amounts  . 

(a)        The Company shall pay any amounts due with respect to the Securities and the Guarantors will pay any amounts due with respect to the Securities Guarantees without deduction or withholding for any and all present and future withholding taxes, levies, imposts and charges (a    withholding tax   ) imposed by or for the account of the Cayman Islands, Switzerland or any other jurisdiction in which either the Company or a Guarantor is a resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority of such jurisdiction (the    Taxing Jurisdiction   ), unless such withholding or deduction is required by law.  If such deduction or withholding is at any time required, the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, will, to the fullest extent allowed by law (subject to compliance by the holder of a Security with any relevant administrative requirements), pay additional amounts (the    Additional Amounts   ) in respect of principal amount, redemption price and interest (if any), in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture, as may be necessary so that the net amounts paid to the holder or the Trustee after such deduction or withholding will equal the principal amount, redemption price and interest (if any), on the Securities.  However, neither the Company nor any Guarantor will pay any Additional Amounts in the following instances: 

(1)        if any withholding would not be payable or due but for the fact that (i) the holder of a Security (or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary of, member or shareholder of, the holder, if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation), is a domiciliary, national or resident of, or engaging in business or maintaining a permanent establishment or being physically present in, the Taxing Jurisdiction or otherwise having some present or former connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction other than the holding or ownership of the Security or the collection of principal amount, redemption price, repurchase price and interest (if any), in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture, or the enforcement of the Security or (ii) where presentation is required, the Security was presented more than 30 days after the date such payment became due or was provided for, whichever is later; 

(2)        if any withholding tax is attributable to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise, personal property or similar tax, levy, impost or charge; 

(3)        if any withholding tax is attributable to any tax, levy, impost or charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payment of principal amount, redemption price, repurchase price and interest (if any); 

(4)        if any withholding tax would not have been imposed but for the failure to comply with certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connections with the relevant tax authority of the holder or beneficial owner of the Security, if this compliance is required by statute or by regulation as a precondition to relief or exemption from such withholding tax; 

(5)        to the extent a holder of a Security is entitled to a refund or credit in such Taxing Jurisdiction of amounts required to be withheld by such Taxing Jurisdiction; 

82 

(6)        if any withholding or deduction is required to be made pursuant to any agreements between the European Community and other countries or territories providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the Council Directive 2003/48/EC, including, but not limited to, the agreement between the European Union and Switzerland of October 26, 2004, or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such agreements; 

(7)        if any withholding is required to be made pursuant to laws enacted by Switzerland providing for the taxation of payments according to principles similar to those laid down in the draft legislation of the Swiss Federal Council of December 17, 2014, or otherwise changing the Swiss federal withholding tax system from an issuer-based system to a paying agent based system pursuant to which a person other than the issuer is required to withhold tax on any interest payments; 

(8)        if any withholding tax or deduction is required to be made pursuant to an agreement between Switzerland and another country or countries on final withholding taxes levied by Swiss paying agents in respect of persons resident in the other country on income of such person on any Securities booked or deposited with a Swiss paying agent (  Abgeltungssteuer  ), and such holder of a Security chooses not to provide the certification, documentation or other information that would eliminate such withholding or deduction; 

(9)        if any withholding tax or deduction is required to be made in respect of any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date hereof (or any amended or successor version), current or future U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder or any official interpretation thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code; or 

(10)       any combination of the instances described in the preceding clauses. 

(b)        With respect to clause (a)(5) above, in the absence of evidence satisfactory to the Company or the applicable Guarantor, it may conclusively presume that a holder of a Security is entitled to a refund or credit of all amounts required to be withheld.  The Company or the applicable Guarantor also will not pay any Additional Amounts to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of the Security to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner thereof, would not have been entitled to the payment of such Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of the Security. 

SECTION 13.02.          Swiss Minimum Interest  . 

(a)        When entering into this Indenture, the parties have assumed that the payments under the Indenture and the other Note Documents are not and will not become subject to any tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax. 

(b)        Notwithstanding the paragraph above if a tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax should, at any time, be or become required by law in respect of any payment under the Indenture or any other Note Document and should it be unlawful for a Guarantor incorporated in Switzerland (each, a    Swiss Guarantor   ) to comply with Section 13.01 for any reason (where this would otherwise be required by the terms of Section 13.01) then:  

83 

(1)        the applicable interest rate in relation to that payment shall be the interest rate which would have applied to that payment, as provided for in the applicable Security, divided by 1 minus the rate at which the relevant tax deduction is required to be made under Swiss domestic tax law and/or applicable double taxation treaties (where the rate at which the relevant tax deduction is required to be made is for this purpose expressed as a fraction of 1); and 

(2)        such Swiss Guarantor shall: 

(A)        pay the relevant interest at the adjusted rate in accordance with paragraph (1) above; 

(B)        make a tax deduction on the interest so recalculated; and 

(C)        all references to a rate of interest under the Note Documents shall be construed accordingly.

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated. 

1.            INTEREST  .  Transocean Phoenix 2 Limited (the  Company ) promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at   7.75  % per annum.  The Company shall pay interest semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2017.  Interest on the Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from October 19, 2016.  Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal, interest and other overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2.00% in excess of the rate which would have been payable if such overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted an outstanding amount of the Securities.  Such interest shall be payable in accordance with Section 2.11 of the Indenture.  Pursuant to Section 2.11 of the Indenture, the interest rate of the Securities shall automatically increase to match the All-In Yield of any Affiliate Financing with an All-In Yield of at least 1.00% higher than the All-In Yield of the Securities, if any such Affiliate Financing is consummated within three months after the Issue Date.  

2.            METHOD OF PAYMENT  .  The Company shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Securities at the close of business on the April 1 or  October 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if such Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date.  Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments.

Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Depository.  The Company shall make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof;   provided  ,    however  , that payments on a certificated Security shall be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).

11.          UNCLAIMED MONEY  .  If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person.  After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment. 

12.          DISCHARGE AND DEFEASANCE  .  Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its and any other Note Parties  obligations under the Securities, the Securities Guarantees, the Indenture and the other Note Documents with respect to the Securities (including the Securities Guarantees) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity (after deducting therefrom the amount contained in the Debt Service Reserve Account as of such date), as the case may be. 

13.          AMENDMENT; SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER  .  Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture, the Securities and the other Note Documents  may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Securities), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Securities or the other Note Documents may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Securities).  Without the consent of any Holder of Securities, the Indenture, the Securities or the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture or other Note Documents,   provided   such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect, to release, terminate or discharge, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of, any Collateral or any Securities Guarantee when permitted or required by this Indenture or the Security Documents or to amend or supplement any Security Document in accordance with the Indenture or the Security Document, including, without limitation, upon the replacement of a Collateral Rig Owner or in connection with a transfer of the Drilling Contract, in each case, in accordance with the Indenture.

15.          TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH COMPANY  .  The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may become a creditor of, or otherwise deal with the Company or any of its Affiliates, with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 

16.          NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS  .

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated. 

1.            INTEREST  .  Transocean Phoenix 2 Limited (the  Company ) promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at   7.75  % per annum.  The Company shall pay interest semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2017.  Interest on the Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from October 19, 2016.  Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal, interest and other overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2.00% in excess of the rate which would have been payable if such overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted an outstanding amount of the Securities.  Such interest shall be payable in accordance with Section 2.11 of the Indenture.  Pursuant to Section 2.11 of the Indenture, the interest rate of the Securities shall automatically increase to match the All-In Yield of any Affiliate Financing with an All-In Yield of at least 1.00% higher than the All-In Yield of the Securities, if any such Affiliate Financing is consummated within three months after the Issue Date.  

2.            METHOD OF PAYMENT  .  The Company shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Securities at the close of business on the April 1 or  October 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if such Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date.  Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments.  The Company shall pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.  Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Depository.  The Company shall make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof;   provided  ,    however  , that payments on a certificated Security shall be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). 

3.            PAYING AGENT AND REGISTRAR  .

4.            INDENTURE  .  The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of  October 19, 2016 (the  Indenture ), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee.

16.          NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS  .  A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any other Note Party shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or this Indenture or of such Note Party under its Securities Guarantee, this Indenture or other Note Document, as applicable, or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.

8.1.      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and at any time during the continuance thereof, the Collateral Agent shall have the right (acting at the direction of Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities), but not the obligation to enforce the Right of Pledge and to foreclose on the Pledged Quotas. 

8.2.      Without limiting any of the powers conferred on the Collateral Agent by this Clause  8, upon the security interest constituted by this Agreement becoming enforceable as set out in Clause  8.1, the Collateral Agent shall have the right (acting at the direction of Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities) in its absolute discretion to:

The Collateral Agent shall (acting at the direction of Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities) enjoy full discretion as to the manner, time and place at which such enforcement is to take place. 

8.4.

The exercise of such power shall be conclusive evidence of the Mortgagee s right to exercise it and no person dealing with the Mortgagee shall need to enquire whether the Power of Attorney contained herein has become exercisable.  The Shipowner ratifies and confirms whatever the attorney does or purports to do under this Section. 

Section 5.        Delivery of Rig  .

Section 6.        Mortgagee to Discharge Liens  .  The Shipowner authorizes and empowers the Mortgagee or its appointees or any of them to appear in the name of the Shipowner, its successors and assigns, in any court of any country or nation of the world where a suit is pending against the Rig because of or on account of any alleged lien (except for Permitted Collateral Liens) against the Rig from which the Rig has not been released and to take such proceedings as to them or any of them may seem proper towards the defense of such suit and the purchase or discharge of such lien, and all expenditures made or incurred by them or any of them for the purpose of such defense or purchase or discharge shall be a debt due from the Shipowner, its successors and assigns, to the Mortgagee, and shall be secured by the lien of this Mortgage in like manner and extent as if the amount and description thereof were written herein. 

Section 7.        Payment of Expenses  .  The Shipowner covenants that upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of Default, then, upon written demand of the Mortgagee (acting at the direction of Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities), the Shipowner will pay to the Mortgagee the whole amount due and payable in respect of the Indebtedness hereby secured; and in case the Shipowner shall fail to pay the same forthwith upon such demand, the Mortgagee shall be entitled to recover judgment for the whole amount so due and unpaid, together with such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable compensation of the Mortgagee or its agents, attorneys and counsel and any necessary advances, expenses and liabilities made or incurred by it or them or the Mortgagee hereunder.  All moneys collected by the Mortgagee under this Section 7 shall be applied by the Mortgagee in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of this Article III (  Application of Proceeds  ). 

Section 8.        Remedies Cumulative  .  Each and every power and remedy herein given to the Mortgagee shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other power and remedy herein given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, in admiralty or by statute, and each and every power and remedy whether herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Mortgagee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other power or remedy.  The Mortgagee shall not be required or bound to enforce any of its rights under any of the other Note Documents, prior to enforcing its rights under this Mortgage.  No delay  

Appendix H-11 

or omission by the Mortgagee in the exercise of any right or power or in the pursuance of any remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or to be an acquiescence therein; nor shall the acceptance by the Mortgagee of any security or of any payment of or on account of the Indebtedness hereby secured maturing after any Event of Default or of any payment on account of any past default be construed to be a waiver of any right to exercise its remedies due to any future Event of Default or of any past Event of Default not completely cured thereby.  No consent, waiver or approval of the Mortgagee shall be deemed to be effective unless in writing and duly signed by authorized signatories of the Mortgagee in accordance with the Indenture; any waiver by the Mortgagee of any of the terms of this Mortgage or any consent given under this Mortgage shall only be effective for the purpose and on the terms which it is given and shall be without prejudice to the right to give or withhold consent in relation to future matters (which are either the same or different).

(b)      In the event that the Indenture, this Mortgage, any of the other Note Documents or any of the documents or instruments which may from time to time be delivered thereunder or hereunder or any provision thereof or hereof shall be deemed invalidated by present or future law of any nation or by  

Appendix H-12 

decision of any court, this shall not affect the validity and/or enforceability of all or any other parts of the Indenture, this Mortgage, any of the other Note Documents or such documents or instruments and, in any such case, the Shipowner covenants and agrees that, on demand, it will execute and deliver such other and further agreements and/or documents and/or instruments and do such things as the Mortgagee in its sole discretion may reasonably deem to be necessary to carry out the true intent of this Mortgage, the Indenture and the other Note Documents. 

(c)      In the event that the title, or ownership of the Rig shall be requisitioned, purchased or taken by any government of any country or any department, agency or representative thereof, pursuant to any present or future law, proclamation, decree order or otherwise, the lien of this Mortgage shall be deemed to attach to the claim for compensation therefor, and the compensation, purchase or other taking of such title or ownership is hereby agreed to be payable to the Mortgagee who shall be entitled to receive the same and shall apply it as provided in Section 11 of this Article III (  Application of Proceeds  );   provided   that if the Rig is replaced pursuant to a Collateral Rig Substitution before the applicable date specified in subclauses (x) and (y) of Section 3.09(b) of the Indenture, such proceeds shall be paid over upon receipt by the Mortgagee to the Shipowner.  In the event of any such requisition, purchase or taking, and the failure of the Mortgagee to receive proceeds as herein provided, the Shipowner shall promptly execute and deliver to the Mortgagee such documents, if any, as in the opinion of the Mortgagee may be necessary or useful to facilitate or expedite the collection by the Mortgagee of such part of the compensation, purchase price, reimbursement or award as is payable to it hereunder. 

(d)      Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, it is intended that nothing herein shall waive the priority status of this Mortgage, and if any provision of this Mortgage or portion thereof shall be construed to waive the priority status of this Mortgage, then such provision to such extent shall be void and of no effect.

Section 6.01        Collateral Agent s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, Etc  . 

(a)          The Pledgor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor, as appropriate, or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all reasonably appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be reasonably necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Pledgor hereby gives the Collateral Agent the power and right, on behalf of the Pledgor, without notice to or assent by the Pledgor, to do any or all of the following: 

(i)           unless being disputed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, pay or discharge taxes and liens (other than liens for taxes not yet delinquent, or which can thereafter be paid without penalty, in each case such that the lien cannot be enforced) levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement, the Indenture or any other Note Document and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof; 

(ii)          execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 5.01, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; and 

Appendix J-7 

(iii)         (A) direct any party liable for any payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Creditors) or as the Collateral Agent shall direct; (B) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (C) in the name of the Pledgor, as appropriate, or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any check, draft, note, acceptance or other instrument for the payment of moneys due with respect to any Collateral and commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral; (D) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against the Pledgor with respect to any Collateral; (E) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Collateral Agent may deem appropriate; and (F) sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Collateral Agent s option and the Pledgor s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Collateral Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Collateral Agent s security interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as the Pledgor might do. 

Anything in this Section 6.01(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, (x) the Collateral Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 6.01(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (y) the parties agree that the grant of the power of attorney set forth in this Section 6.01(a) shall not be deemed to create an obligation on the part of the Collateral Agent to take any one or more of the actions described herein. 

(b)          If the Pledgor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein within the applicable grace periods, the Collateral Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement. 

(c)          The expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in and in accordance with this Section 6.01 shall constitute the Notes Obligations and shall be payable by the Pledgor to the Collateral Agent on demand.

Section 6.02        Duty of Collateral Agent  . The Collateral Agent s sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Collateral Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the Collateral Agent, any other Secured Creditor nor any of their respective agents, employees, stockholders, directors and officers shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of the Pledgor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the  

Appendix J-8 

Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect the Collateral Agent s and the other Secured Creditors  interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither it nor any of its agents, employees, stockholders, directors and officers shall be responsible to the Pledgor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non appealable decision. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall be under no duty whatsoever to make or give any presentment, notice of dishonor, protest, demand for performance, notice of non-performance, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, or other notice or demand in connection with any Collateral or the Notes Obligations, or to take any steps necessary to preserve any rights against the Pledgor or any other Person or ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not it has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters. The Pledgor, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waives any right of marshaling in respect of any and all Collateral, and waives any right to require the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor to proceed against the Pledgor or any other Person, exhaust any Collateral or enforce any other remedy which the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor now has or may hereafter have against the Pledgor and any other Person. 

Section 6.03        Authority of Collateral Agent  . The Pledgor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Collateral Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Collateral Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Collateral Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement or in connection with the Notes Obligations shall, as between the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Creditors, be governed by the terms of the Indenture (including, without limitation, the rights and protections set forth therein) and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Collateral Agent and the Pledgor, the Collateral Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Creditors with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Pledgor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority. 

Section 6.04        Limitation on Duty of Collateral Agent in Respect of Collateral  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for filing any financing or continuation statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or times or otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any security interest in the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, damage or diminution in the value of any of the Collateral, by reason of the act or omission of any carrier, forwarding agency or other agent or bailee appointed by the Collateral Agent in good faith. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the Collateral, or for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the liens in any of the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to act on its part hereunder, for the validity or sufficiency of the Collateral or any agreement or assignment contained therein, for the validity of the title of the Pledgor to the Collateral, for insuring the Collateral or for the payment of taxes, charges, assessments or liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall have no duty to ascertain, monitor, investigate or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of this Agreement by the Pledgor or any other party to such documents. 

Appendix J-9 

Section 6.05        Indemnity and Expenses  . 

(a)        Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the Collateral Agent under any of the other Note Documents, the Pledgor agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Collateral Agent (in its individual capacity and as Collateral Agent for the Secured Creditors) and each of its officers, directors and agents (each, an    Indemnified Party   ) from and against any and all loss, damage, claims, liability, cost or expense (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses) incurred by any Indemnified Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement of this Agreement), except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from an Indemnified Party s gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

(b)        Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the Collateral Agent under any of the other Note Documents, the Pledgor will, upon demand, reimburse the Collateral Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, its agents, counsel, accountants and experts (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses) in connection with (i) the transactions which give rise to this Agreement, the preparation of this Agreement and the administration of this Agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, use or operation of, or the sale of, collection from or other realization upon, any of the Collateral of the Pledgor, or (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Creditors hereunder.

(b)        No failure on the part of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor to exercise, and no delay in exercising any right hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement shall in any manner impair or affect other security for the Notes Obligations. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent provided herein and in the other Note Documents are cumulative and are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law or otherwise. 

Section 7.02        Notices, etc  .

Section 7.03        Continuing Security Interest; Successors and Assigns  .

(a)        All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Pledgor herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Note Document to which it is a party shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Collateral Agent and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, regardless of any investigation made by the Collateral Agent or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Collateral Agent may have had notice or knowledge of any default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder or under any other Note Document, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any of the Notes Obligations is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Section 6.05 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Notes Obligations, or the termination of this Agreement or any other Note Document or any provision hereof or thereof or the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent in accordance with Article 12.06 of the Indenture. 

(b)        To the extent that any payments on the Notes Obligations or proceeds of any Collateral are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Notes Obligations so satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and the Collateral Agent s and the Secured Creditors  liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. In such event, this Agreement shall be automatically reinstated and the Pledgor shall take such action as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to effect such reinstatement. 

(c)        The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement are independent of the Notes Obligations or any other obligations of any other pledgor under or in respect of the other Note Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Pledgor to enforce this Agreement, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Pledgor or whether the Pledgor is joined in any such action or actions. All rights of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Creditors and the pledge, assignment and security interest hereunder, and all obligations of the Pledgor hereunder, shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Pledgor hereby irrevocably waives (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) any defenses it may now have or may hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: 

(i)           any lack of validity or enforceability of any Note Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; 

(ii)          any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Notes Obligations or any other obligations of the Company or any other Note Party under or in respect of any Note Document or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from any Note Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the Notes Obligations; 

(iii)         any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral or any other collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Notes Obligations;

Appendix J-11 

or in respect of the Note Documents or any other assets of the Company or any other Note Party; 

(v)          any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of the Company or any other Note Party;

Section 7.10        Releases, Termination  . 

(a)        In connection with the entry of new account control agreement documentation with respect to the Bareboat Account, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the then existing account control agreement documentation with respect to the Bareboat Account shall be simultaneously terminated.

In no event shall the Collateral Agent be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss, lost profits or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit and diminution in the value thereof) irrespective of whether the Collateral Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. 

No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

If the Collateral Agent resigns or is removed in accordance with the Indenture, such retiring Collateral Agent shall cease to be a party to this Agreement and all obligations imposed upon such retiring Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be terminated as to such retiring Collateral Agent and deemed to be imposed upon the successor Collateral Agent appointed pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, provided, however, the retiring Collateral Agent s indemnification rights contained in this Agreement, the Indenture or otherwise shall continue in favor of the retiring Collateral Agent. 

Section 7.14        U.S.A Patriot Act  . The Pledgor acknowledges that in order to help the United States government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, pursuant to Federal regulations that became effective on October 1, 2003 (Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act), all financial institutions are required to obtain, verify, record and update information that identifies each person establishing a relationship or opening an account.

Until the Agent gives written notice to the Company otherwise, subject to any express provision of this Deed to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to deal with the Operator in relation to all matters arising under the Contract as if the Security Documents had not been entered into.

4.         Quiet Enjoyment 

4.1        In consideration of the covenants on the part of the Company contained in this Deed and subject always (i) to there having occurred no material breach, default or event of default on the part of the Company under the Contract (beyond any period given to the Company in the Contract to cure such material breach, default or event of default) in consequence of which the Operator is entitled to terminate and has thereafter lawfully terminated the Contract in accordance with its terms including, without limitation, withdrawal of the Drilling Unit from the Contract by the Operator for non-payment of hire, and (ii) to the Drilling Unit not having become an actual, agreed, arranged or constructive total loss and being no longer available to the Operator under the terms of the Contract, the Agent irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes that, irrespective of any breach or default by the Operator, or any insolvency of the Operator, or any other circumstance which might otherwise allow the Agent or anyone claiming under or through the Agent to arrest or take possession or control of the Drilling Unit, neither the Agent nor anyone claiming under or through the Agent shall: 

Appendix K-6 

(a)         interfere with or otherwise disturb in any way the Company s quiet, peaceful and continuing use, possession and employment of the Drilling Unit under the Contract; nor

4.3        Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, if instructed by the requisite Holders in accordance with the Indenture to do so, the Agent shall promptly notify the Company in writing that an Event of Default has occurred which, but for Clause 4.1, would entitle the Agent to take possession of and/or to sell the Drilling Unit and/or to exercise any right of foreclosure pursuant to the Mortgage and/or exercise any right pursuant to the Assignment. For a period of 60 days after service of such notice by the Agent, the Agent and the Company will consult on the identity of a new counterparty to the Contract, which will be subject to the approval of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion (the    Successor Party   ), and the Company will, at the request and expense of the Agent, co-operate with the Agent  in order to effect a transfer of the rights under the Contract to such Successor Company within a commercially reasonable amount of time after the Company and the Agent identify the Successor Party provided that: 

(a)         the Successor Party and the Agent (acting at the direction of the requisite Holders in accordance with the Indenture) enter into a Deed of Quiet Enjoyment with the Company in materially identical terms to this Deed; and 

(b)         the Successor Party assumes all the rights and obligations of the Operator under the Contract. 

Appendix K-7

5            Covenants 

The Company covenants with the Agent: 

(a)         that it will not cancel, rescind, terminate or repudiate the Contract or request withdrawal of the Drilling Unit from service under the Contract, without giving the Agent prior written notice and a period of at least 30 days to remedy any breach entitling the Company to cancel, rescind, terminate or repudiate the Contract, it being understood and agreed that this Clause shall not apply to any termination of the Contract that shall occur by operation of law without action by either the Operator or the Company; 

(b)         that it will not without the prior written consent of the Agent  (acting with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities in accordance with the Indenture) agree to (i) any material amendment to or material modification or variation of the Contract (the Company agrees that any amendment or modification that decreases the termination fees payable or shortens the tenor of the Contract shall be a material amendment or modification). For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that minor technical and administrative changes agreed between the Company and the Operator to the Contract from time to time shall not constitute material amendments or variations for the purpose of this Clause  5(b). As between the Operator and the Company, the Operator agrees that if the consent of the Agent (acting with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities) is required under this Clause 5(b), the Operator shall seek such consent from the Holders on behalf of the Company and shall copy the Company in its solicitation of consent from the Holders and any relevant correspondence with the Agent.

Upon any such sale or transfer, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser or transferee thereof the Collateral so sold or transferred. 

(b)      Any cash held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent and all cash proceeds received by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral may at any time thereafter be applied in whole or in part by the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Creditors, against, all or any part of the Notes Obligations, in the manner set forth in the Indenture.

(i)         unless being disputed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, pay or discharge taxes and liens (other than liens for taxes not yet delinquent, or which can thereafter be paid without penalty, in each case such that the lien cannot be enforced) levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement, the Indenture or any other Note Document and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof; 

(ii)        execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 5.01, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; and

Appendix M-7 

or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Collateral Agent s option and the Pledgor s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Collateral Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Collateral Agent s security interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as the Pledgor might do. 

Anything in this Section 6.01(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, (x) the Collateral Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 6.01(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (y) the parties agree that the grant of the power of attorney set forth in this Section 6.01(a) shall not be deemed to create an obligation on the part of the Collateral Agent to take any one or more of the actions described herein. 

(b)      If the Pledgor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein within the applicable grace periods, the Collateral Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.

All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released as set forth in Section 7.10(b). 

Section 6.02        Duty of Collateral Agent  . The Collateral Agent s sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Collateral Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the Collateral Agent, any other Secured Creditor nor any of their respective agents, employees, stockholders, directors and officers shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of the Pledgor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect the Collateral Agent s and the other Secured Creditors  interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither it nor any of its agents, employees, stockholders, directors and officers shall be responsible to the Pledgor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non appealable decision. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall be under no duty whatsoever to make or give any presentment, notice of dishonor, protest, demand for performance, notice of non-performance, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, or other notice or demand in connection with any Collateral or the Notes Obligations, or to take any steps necessary to preserve any rights against the Pledgor or any other Person or ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not it has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters. The Pledgor, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waives any right of marshaling in respect of any and all Collateral, and waives any right to require the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor to proceed against the Pledgor  

Appendix M-8

Section 6.04        Limitation on Duty of Collateral Agent in Respect of Collateral  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for filing any financing or continuation statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or times or otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any security interest in the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, damage or diminution in the value of any of the Collateral, by reason of the act or omission of any carrier, forwarding agency or other agent or bailee appointed by the Collateral Agent in good faith. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the Collateral, or for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the liens in any of the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to act on its part hereunder, for the validity or sufficiency of the Collateral or any agreement or assignment contained therein, for the validity of the title of the Pledgor to the Collateral, for insuring the Collateral or for the payment of taxes, charges, assessments or liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall have no duty to ascertain, monitor, investigate or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of this Agreement by the Pledgor or any other party to such documents. 

Section 6.05        Indemnity and Expenses  . 

(a)      Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the Collateral Agent under any of the other Note Documents, the Pledgor agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Collateral Agent (in its individual capacity and as Collateral Agent for the Secured Creditors) and each of its officers, directors and agents (each, an  Indemnified Party ) from and against any and all loss, damage, claims, liability, cost or expense (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses) incurred by any Indemnified Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement of this Agreement), except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from an Indemnified Party s gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

(b)      Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the Collateral Agent under any of the other Note Documents, the Pledgor will, upon demand, reimburse the Collateral Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, its agents, counsel, accountants and experts (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses) in connection with (i) the transactions which give rise

FORM OF SECURITY PROCEDURES CERTIFICATE

Security Procedures Certificate 

PURSUANT TO SECTION 7.10 OF THE INDENTURE 

I hereby certify that I am authorized to deliver this Certificate on behalf of Transocean Phoenix 2 Limited (the  Company ), and hereby further certify that the names, titles, telephone numbers, email addresses and specimen signatures set forth below identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or confirm transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of the Company, and that the option checked in Part C of this Certificate is the security procedure selected by the Company for use in verifying that a funds transfer instruction received by the Trustee is that of the Company.   

The Company has reviewed each of these security procedures and has determined that the option checked in Part C of this Certificate best meets its requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will issue to the Trustee.  By selecting the security procedure specified in Part C of this Certificate, the Company acknowledges that it has elected to not use the other security procedures described below and agrees to be bound by any funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the Trustee in compliance with the particular security procedure chosen by the Company.   

NOTICE  :  The security procedure selected by the Company will not be used to detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by the Company.  If a funds transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment inconsistently by name and account number, payment may be made on the basis of the account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary.  If a funds transfer instruction describes a participating financial institution inconsistently by name and identification number, the identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution.  Therefore, it is important that the Company take such steps as it deems prudent to ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer instructions it sends to the Trustee.

The person confirming the funds transfer instruction shall be a person other than the person from whom the funds transfer instruction was received, unless only one person is designated in both Parts A and B of this Certificate.    The Company understands the risks associated with communicating sensitive matters, including time sensitive matters, by email.  The Company further acknowledges that instructions and data sent by email may be less confidential or secure than instructions or data transmitted by other methods. The Trustee shall not be liable for any loss of the confidentiality of instructions and data prior to receipt by the Trustee  .   

CHECK box, if applicable: 

If the Trustee is unable to obtain confirmation by email, the Trustee may, at its discretion, confirm by telephone call-back, as described in Option 1. 

Option 3. Delivery of funds transfer instructions by password protected file transfer system only - no confirmation  .  The Trustee offers the option to deliver funds transfer instructions through a password protected file transfer system. If the Company wishes to use the password protected file transfer system, further instructions will be provided by the Trustee.  If the Company chooses this Option 3, it agrees that no further confirmation of funds transfer instructions will be performed by the Trustee.  

Option 4.  Delivery of funds transfer instructions by password protected file transfer system with confirmation  .  Same as Option 3 above, but the Trustee shall confirm funds transfer instructions by        telephone call-back   or         email (must check at least one, may check both) to a person at the telephone number or email address designated on Part B above.  By checking a box in the prior sentence, the party shall be deemed to have agreed to the terms of such confirmation option as more fully described in Option 1 and Option 2 above.
