1 - Business Organization and Basis of Presentation   

CohBar,
Inc. ( CohBar  or the  Company ) is a leader in the research and development of mitochondria based
therapeutics (MBTs), an emerging class of drugs for the treatment of diseases associated with aging. MBTs originate from the discovery
by the Company s founders of a novel group of peptides within the genome of mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell. The
Company s ongoing development of these mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) into MBTs offers the potential to address a
broad range of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cancer, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative
disorders.  

The
Company s primary activities since inception include the discovery of MDPs and research and development of its MBT pipeline,
securing intellectual property protection, managing collaborations with Contract Research Organizations ( CROs ) and
academic institutions, expanding its scientific leadership and laboratory staff and raising capital. To date, the Company has
not generated any revenues from operations and does not expect to generate any revenues in the near future.  

The
unaudited interim condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). They do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP
for complete financial statements. Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed
in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K (the  2015 Form 10-K ), filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. The interim unaudited condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with those audited financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments,
have been made. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any other period.  

Note
2 - Management s Liquidity Plans   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital and stockholders  equity of $7,160,671 and $7,413,077, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $4,397,851. The Company has not generated
any revenues, has incurred net losses since inception and does not expect to generate revenues in the near term.  

Based on current budget
assumptions, funding from warrant exercises (see Note  6) and
with the cash and investments on hand as of September 30, 2016, the Company believes that it has sufficient
capital to meet its operating expenses and working capital needs for the next twelve months from the date of this
filing. However, if other unanticipated difficulties arise the Company may be required to raise additional capital to support
its operations, curtail its research and development activities until such time as additional capital becomes available and delay
its target for its upcoming FDA filings and clinical activities. These activities will allow the Company to slow its rate of spending
and extend its use of cash until additional capital is raised. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.
There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that the Company will be able to obtain such
financing on reasonable terms.

3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation     

All
amounts are presented in U.S. Dollars.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at dates of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company s
significant estimates and assumptions include the fair value of financial instruments, stock-based compensation, debt discount
and the valuation allowance relating to the Company s deferred tax assets.  

Investments    

As
of September 30, 2016, investments consisted of U.S. Treasury Bills of $1,492,309, which are classified as held-to-maturity, and
Certificates of Deposit of $584,696. The Company determines the appropriate balance sheet classification of its investments at
the time of purchase and evaluates the classification at each balance sheet date. All of the Company s U.S. Treasury
Bills mature within the next twelve months. Unrealized gains and losses are  de minimis . As of September 30, 2016, the carrying
value of the Company s U.S. Treasury Bills approximates their fair value.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an
asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company utilizes three levels of inputs that
may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  

  Level
2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable  

  Level
3 - inputs that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)  

The
carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt approximate fair value due to the short-term
nature of these instruments. The amount of long-term debt included in the accompanying condensed balance sheets approximates its
fair value.  

Share-Based
Payment    

The
Company accounts for share-based payments using the fair value method. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award
is measured, as discussed below, on the grant date. For non-employees, fair value is generally valued based on the fair value
of the services provided or the fair value of the equity instruments on the measurement date, whichever is more readily determinable
and re-measured on each financial reporting dates until the service is complete. The Company has granted stock options at exercise
prices equal to the higher of (i) the closing price of the Company s common stock as reported on the OTCQX marketplace or
(ii) the closing price of the Company s common stock as reported by the TSX Venture Exchange on the date of grant.

Note
3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)   

The
weighted-average fair value of options and warrants has been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The fair value of each instrument is estimated on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest
rate, volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. Since the Company has a limited history of being publicly traded,
the fair value of stock-based payment awards issued was estimated using a volatility derived from an index of comparable entities.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management s best estimates,
but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change
and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different
in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those
shares expected to vest. In estimating the Company s forfeiture rate, the Company analyzed its historical forfeiture rate,
the remaining lives of unvested options, and the number of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If the
Company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture
rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in
the current period.  

The
weighted-average Black-Scholes assumptions are as follows:  

As
of September 30, 2016, total unrecognized stock option compensation expense was $1,919,969, which will be recognized as those
options vest over a period of approximately four years. The amount of future stock option compensation expense could be affected
by any future option grants or by any option holders leaving the Company before their grants are fully vested.  

Net
Loss Per Share of Common Stock    

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other instruments to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  Potentially dilutive
securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and consist
of the following:

Litigations,
Claims and Assessments    

The
Company may from time to time be party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As the
Company grows and gains prominence in the marketplace it may become party to an increasing number of litigation matters and claims.
The outcome of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of these matters could materially
affect the Company s future results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company is not currently a party
to any legal proceedings.  

Operating
Lease    

The
Company is a party to a lease agreement for a laboratory facility. The laboratory space is leased on a month-to-month basis and
is part of a shared facility in Menlo Park, California.  

Rent
expense was $41,343 and $30,904 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rent expense was $116,378
and $76,646 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rent expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 included $5,700 for a previous laboratory space in Pasadena, California.

Stock
Options    

The
Company has one incentive stock plan, the Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan ), and has
granted stock options to employees, non-employee directors and consultants from the 2011 Plan. Options granted under the 2011
Plan may be Incentive Stock Options or Non-statutory Stock Options, as determined by the Administrator at the time of grant. In
January 2016, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of the Company s common stock to an investor relations
firm as partial compensation for consulting services it will provide to the Company over a two year period.   Pursuant
to applicable policies of the TSX-V, the shares issuable under the warrant  will be counted
against the limit of shares authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan, notwithstanding that the warrant was not issued under
the 2011 Plan. After giving effect to this limitation there were 1,665,572 shares remaining available for issuance under the 2011
Plan at September 30, 2016.

Note
6 - Stockholders  Equity (continued)   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted stock options to employees to purchase 1,696,000 shares of the Company s
common stock. The stock options have exercise prices that range from $1.10 to $1.55 per share, are subject to vesting over four
years, have terms of ten years and have an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $1,418,000.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 10,000 stock options were exercised for cash proceeds of $2,600.  

The
Company recorded $190,816 and $94,389 of stock based compensation in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company recorded $524,118 and $310,594 of stock-based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
following table represents stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

The
table above includes 731,100 compensation options in the exercised balance that were exercised by agents that took part in the
IPO.  

Agent s
Compensation Options    

In connection with the
closing of its Initial Public Offering ( IPO ) in January 2015  the
Company issued 786,696 compensation options ( Compensation Options ) to the agents that took part in the offering.
Each Compensation Option was exercisable for a unit consisting of one share of common stock and one-half of one common stock purchase
warrant at an exercise price of $1.00 per unit. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the agents that took part in
the Company s IPO exercised a total of 731,100 Compensation Options into shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of
$731,085. The unexercised Compensation Options expired on July 6, 2016. Each whole warrant issuable upon exercise of Compensation
Options is exercisable to acquire one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share at any time up to January
6, 2017, subject to the Company s right to accelerate the expiration time of the warrants if at any time the volume-weighted
average trading price of its common stock is equal to or exceeds $3.00 per share for twenty (20) consecutive trading days. Because
the Compensation Options were considered a cost of the IPO, the resulting value is recognized as both an increase and decrease
to the equity section of the accompanying condensed balance sheets.

7 - Related Party Transactions   

Two
of the Company s directors, Pinchas Cohen and Nir Barzilai, provide consulting services to the Company pursuant to agreements
that provide for annual compensation to each director of $42,000. Each agreement provides for an annual service term and can be
extended by mutual consent of both parties. The service terms under the agreements expired in 2015. The Company continues to compensate
Dr. Cohen and Dr. Barzilai for their ongoing services under the terms of the original agreements. The Company incurred expenses
of $10,500 for services performed by each Director during each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred expenses of $21,000 for services performed by each Director.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no amounts were owed to either Director.

operations to date have been focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and research and
development of our MDPs. Our research efforts have focused on discovering and evaluating our MDPs for potential development as
MBT drug candidates. We seek to identify and advance research on MDPs with superior potential for yielding a MBT drug candidate,
and ultimately a drug, for which we have a strong intellectual property position.  

Since
our formation in 2007, we have in-licensed key intellectual property from our founders  affiliated academic institutions,
developed methods for identifying new MDPs, discovered new biologically active MDPs, filed additional provisional patent applications
to expand our intellectual property, studied various MDPs in both  in vitro  and  in vivo  models and identified a number
of MDPs with potential therapeutic value in the treatment of diabetes, obesity, NASH, cancer, Alzheimer s disease, atherosclerosis
and other diseases. Based on our evaluation of MDPs currently in our research pipeline we are actively prioritizing additional
MDPs for potential advancement into MBT drug candidate programs.  

We
have identified two analogs from our MOTS-c program for advancement into IND-enabling activities. Those candidates, CB4209 and
CB4211, have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in pre-clinical models for the treatment of obesity, with additional
confirmatory studies planned, including the determination of therapeutic potential for the treatment of NASH, and as a potential
add-on to other drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We are initiating IND-enabling activities and confirmatory studies
for both of these first-in-class MOTS-c analog drug candidates. In addition to these candidates, we have discovered numerous additional
new peptides encoded within the genome of mitochondria.  

We
are the exclusive licensee from the Regents of the University of California and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of four
issued U.S. patents, three U.S. patent applications, a divisional U.S. patent application, and several related international patent
applications in various international jurisdictions. Our licensed patents and patent applications include claims that are directed
to compositions comprising MDPs and their analogs and/or methods of their use in the treatment of indicated diseases. Additionally,
we have filed a provisional patent application directed to composition of matter and methods of use for novel MOTS-c analogs we
have developed, including our CB4209 and CB4211 candidates. We have also filed numerous provisional patent applications relating
to our newly discovered MDPs and their analogs, and we may file additional patent applications going forward. Our new provisional
patent applications are not subject to the license agreements with the Regents of the University of California and the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine.   

We
have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from sales of our equity securities and, to a far lesser extent, from
grants from research foundations. Since our inception through September 30, 2016, our operations have been funded with an aggregate
of approximately $21.1 million, of which approximately $0.2 million was from a grant-funding organization and approximately $20.9
million was from the issuance of equity instruments.  

Since inception, we have
incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $4,397,851 and $2,728,050 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $12,732,388.  Based
on current budget assumptions, funding from warrant exercises (see Note 6) and with the cash and investments on hand as of September
30, 2016, we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our operating expenses and
working capital needs for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. However, if other unanticipated difficulties arise we may
be required to raise additional capital to support our operations, curtail our research and development activities until such
time as additional capital becomes available and delay our target for our upcoming FDA filings and clinical activities. These
activities will allow us to slow our rate of spending and extend our use of cash until additional capital is raised. There can
be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed
or that we will be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter
to quarter and from year to year. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we continue research,
discovery and pre-clinical development efforts on our current MBT candidates and any other MDPs, expand and protect our intellectual
property portfolio, and hire additional development and scientific personnel. Our MBT drug target candidates are in early stages
of investigational research. Candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those
in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We
expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our product candidate development
programs progress.  

Financial
Operations Review    

Revenue

To
date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products
in the near future. In the future, we will seek to generate revenue from product sales, either directly or under any future licensing,
development or similar relationship with a strategic partner.  

Research
and development expenses     

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts,
and the development of our product candidates, which include:  

employee-related
                                         expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense;   

expenses
                                         incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations,
                                         or CROs, that conduct research and development and pre-clinical activities on our behalf
                                         and the cost of consultants;   

the
                                         cost of laboratory equipment, supplies and manufacturing MBT test materials; and   

depreciation
                                         and other personnel-related costs associated with research and product development.    

We
expense all research and development expenses as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase
for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016, as we continue our efforts related to discovering, evaluating, optimizing
and exploiting our MDPs as potential MBT drug candidates.  

General
and administrative expenses     

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel
in executive, finance and administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to patent and corporate
matters and fees for accounting and consulting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase
in the future to support continued research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates.
These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants,
lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we anticipate increased costs associated with being a public company,
including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange
Commission requirements, insurance and investor relations costs.       

   Results
of Operations    

  The
following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results
is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods.  

Comparison
of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Research
and development  expenses were $1,056,429 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $547,029 in the prior year
period, a $509,400 increase. The increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase of $333,120 in 
expenses related to our efforts to develop optimized MBT candidates and an increase of $159,070 in salary, benefits
and stock-based compensation due to the expansion of our scientific staff. We expect research and development expenses to increase
in the coming quarters as we continue to develop optimized MBT candidates.  

General
and administrative  expenses were $598,507 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $531,841 in the prior year
period, a $66,666 increase. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salary, benefits
and stock-based compensation due to the expansion of our executive team with the addition of our new Chief Executive Officer offset
by the timing of a bonus accrued in the previous year quarter with no corresponding expense in the current year period. We expect
general and administrative expenses for the year ending December 31, 2016 to be higher in comparison to prior years as we incur
costs associated with the addition of our new CEO and as we incur increased costs associated with running a public company.  

Comparison
of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Research
and development  expenses were $2,646,125 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,257,075 in the prior year
period, a $1,389,050 increase. The increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase of $692,570
in salary, benefits and stock-based compensation due to the expansion of our scientific staff and an increase of $610,480 in expenses
related to our efforts to develop optimized MBT candidates.  We expect research and development expenses to increase
in the coming quarters as we initiate IND-enabling activities for our CB4209 and CB4211 MBT candidates and continue to evaluate
our pipeline of MDPs.  

General
and administrative  expenses were $1,753,008 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,467,759 in the prior
year period, a $285,249 increase. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salary,
benefits and stock-based compensation due to the expansion of our executive team with the addition of our new Chief Executive
Officer. We expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending December 31, 2016 to be higher in comparison to prior
years as we incur the costs associated with the addition of our new CEO and as we incur increased costs associated with running
a public company.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016 we had $6,012,237 in cash and cash equivalents. We maintain our cash in a checking and savings account on
deposit with a banking institution in the United States. We also maintain a portfolio of short-term highly liquid securities investing
in U.S. Treasury Bills and Certificate of Deposits. As of September 30, 2016, we had investments of $2,077,005.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities    

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,603,364 and $2,683,523, respectively.
The cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to our reported net loss of $4,397,851
offset by $524,118 in stock based compensation expense in the current year period and an increase of $214,334 in accounts payable
due to the timing of invoices received during the quarter. The cash used in operations of $2,683,523 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to our reported net loss of $2,728,050.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities    

Net
cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,337,183. The
cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from redemptions of investments which totaled
$3,410,795 offset by $67,011 in purchases of property and equipment for our lab. The cash used in investing activities of
$5,984,683 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to net purchases of U.S. Treasury Bills and
Certificates of Deposit totaling $5,745,024 and purchases of property and equipment totaling $220,226 as we built out our lab
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities    

Net
cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,474,731 and $12,973,221, respectively.
Cash provided by financing activities of $1,474,731 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the exercise
of Compensation Options resulting in proceeds of $741,046 and the exercise of common stock purchase warrants resulting in proceeds
of $731,085. Cash provided by financing activities of $12,973,221 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due
to the completion of our IPO. We sold 11,250,000 units in the IPO at a price of $1.00 per unit, providing net proceeds of $10,253,484,
net of agents  commissions and expenses. Concurrently with the IPO, we also completed a previously-subscribed private placement
of an additional 2,700,000 units for gross proceeds of $2,700,000.  

Contractual
Obligations    

We
are a party to a lease agreement for a laboratory facility. The laboratory space is leased on a month-to-month basis and is part
of a shared facility in Menlo Park, California.  

Rent
expense was $41,343 and $30,904 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rent expense was $116,378
and $76,646 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rent expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 included $5,700 for a previous laboratory space in Pasadena, California.  

Item
4.    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the end of the period covered by this
report that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness. The material
weakness relates to our having one employee assigned to positions that involve processing financial information, resulting in
a lack of segregation of duties so that all journal entries and account reconciliations are reviewed by someone other than the
preparer, heightening the risk of error or fraud. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or other control deficiencies
are identified, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports as a
public company in a timely manner. Due to our small size and the early stage of our business, segregation of duties may not always
be possible and may not be economically feasible. We have limited capital resources and have given priority in the use of those
resources to our research and development efforts. As a result, we have not been able to take steps to improve our internal controls
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. However, we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal
controls and procedures on an on-going basis. As our operations grow and become more complex, we intend to hire additional personnel
in financial reporting and other areas. However, there can be no assurance of when, if ever, we will be able to remediate the
identified material weaknesses.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule
13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1.    Legal Proceedings   

We
may from time to time be party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As we grow and
gain prominence in the marketplace we may become party to an increasing number of litigation matters and claims. The outcome of
litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of these matters could materially affect our future
results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors   

For
a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations and securities, please see  Risk Factors  in
Item 1A to Part I of our 2015 Form 10-K. In addition, the following supplements and amends the risk factors described in our 2015
Form 10-K.  

We
may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover potential drug development candidates.    

A
key element of our strategy is to identify and test MDPs that play a role in cellular processes underlying our targeted disease
indications. A significant portion of the research that we are conducting involves emerging scientific knowledge and drug discovery
methods. Our drug discovery efforts may not be successful in identifying additional MBTs that may be useful in treating disease.
Early research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential drug development candidates, but actual results produced
by our identified drug candidates may differ materially from initial data, including the results of pre-clinical or clinical studies,
and such results may not support further clinical development. Our research programs may fail to yield candidates for pre-clinical
and clinical development for a number of reasons, including:  

the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying additional appropriate potential drug  development candidates; or   

our current and potential drug development candidates may, on further study, be shown not to be effective  in humans, or to have unacceptable toxicities, harmful side effects, or other characteristics that indicate  that they are unlikely to be medicines that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.   

Research
programs to identify and develop new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may choose
to focus our efforts and resources on a potential product candidate that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful. If we are unable
to identify suitable MBTs for pre-clinical and clinical development, or if the MBTs that we identify prove to be unsuccessful,
we will not be able to obtain product revenues in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial
position and adversely impact our stock price.  

We
have had a history of losses and no revenue.    

Since our conversion to a Delaware
corporation in September 2009 through September 30, 2016, we have accumulated losses of $12,732,388. As of September 30, 2016,
we had working capital of $7,160,671 and stockholders  equity of $7,413,077. We can offer no assurance that we will ever
operate profitably or that we will generate positive cash flow in the future. To date, we have not generated any revenues from
our operations and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. As a result, our management
expects the business to continue to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, if ever,
our business might become profitable. Based on current budget assumptions, funding from warrant exercises and with the cash
and investments on hand as of September 30, 2016, we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our operating
expenses and working capital needs for the next twelve months from the date of this filing.  However, if other unanticipated
difficulties arise, then, prior to this time, we may be required to raise additional capital to support our operations, curtail
our research and development activities until such time as additional capital becomes available and delay our target for upcoming
FDA filings and clinical activities.   Further, until we can generate significant revenues, if ever, we expect to satisfy
our future cash needs through equity or debt financing. We will need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute
our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements.
This may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event we are not able to continue
operations our stockholders will likely suffer a complete loss of their investments in our securities. 

Item
2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

Use
of Proceeds from Registered Securities    

There
has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our final prospectus filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on December 16, 2014 pursuant to Rule 424(b). As of September 30, 2016, we have used proceeds from our
IPO for working capital and general corporate purposes.

 AMENDMENT, DATED AS OF JULY 11, 2016, TO EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 27, 2013, BETWEEN COHBAR, INC. AND JEFFREY F. BIUNNO

Exhibit 10.1  

AMENDMENT
TO EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   

This
Amendment to Executive Employment Agreement (this   Amendment  ), dated as of July 11, 2016, amends that certain
Executive Employment Agreement (the   Agreement  ) dated as of November 27, 2013 between CohBar, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the   Company  ), and Jeffrey Biunno. The Company and Mr. Biunno hereby agree to amend the provisions
of the Agreement as follows:  

1.
Section 2 of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:  

2.
  Term/Termination   .   

Your
employment with the Company is  at will.  Accordingly, both You and the Company remain free at all times to terminate
the employment relationship, with or without cause, immediately upon written notice to the other party. Upon any termination of
Your employment the Company shall pay You any earned but unpaid portion of Your then applicable Base Salary (as defined below),
bonus, benefits and unreimbursed business expenses, in each case with respect to the period ending on the date of notice of termination
(the   Termination Date  ). If Your employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined below), or
if You resign with Good Reason (as defined below), then, in lieu of any further salary, bonus, benefits or other payments for
periods subsequent to the Termination Date (a) the Company shall pay You a severance payment (  Severance  ) in
an aggregate gross amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of your then current annual Base Salary, (b) the Company shall reimburse
You for the premiums on any COBRA coverage that You elect for Yourself and the members of your immediate family for a period of
six (6) months following the Termination Date (  COBRA Reimbursements  ), and (c) the number of unvested shares
subject to the Options (as defined below) equal to the number that would have vested during the twelve (12) months immediately
following the Termination Date shall immediately vest and be exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement
(as defined below). Severance shall be payable at regular intervals in accordance with the Company's normal payroll processes
over a period of six months from the date of such termination (the   Severance Period  ) and shall be subject to
normal payroll deductions and withholding. COBRA Reimbursements shall be paid promptly following Your incurrence of such expenses.  

Any
material breach of this Agreement or that certain Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement by and between You
and the Company dated as of the date hereof which remains uncured during the Severance Period (or which is incapable of cure)
shall immediately relieve the Company from its obligation to pay Severance and/or COBRA Reimbursements and shall entitle the Company
to recover in full any amounts paid under this Section 2. You further recognize and agree that as a precondition to obtaining
Severance and/or COBRA Reimbursements, You must sign a Separation Agreement in a form substantially  similar to the form
of Separation Agreement attached as  Exhibit A  hereto that, among other things, releases any claims You may have against
the Company and such Separation Agreement must become effective within fifty-five (55) days following the Termination Date. Failure
to sign the Separation Agreement and provide for its effectiveness will relieve the Company of any obligation to pay Severance
or COBRA Reimbursements and entitle it to recover any such amounts already paid. 

For
purposes hereof,   Cause   means (i) Your conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony or crime involving
moral turpitude; (ii) dishonesty or fraudulent conduct by You against the Company; (iii) Your willful violation of a key Company
policy or material breach of this Agreement, provided that if such violation or breach is curable, such violation or breach may
be cured by You within ten (10) days after You receive written notice of such violation or breach (including, but not limited
to, acts of harassment, discrimination, or violence; use of unlawful drugs or drunkenness during normal work hours); (iv) the
willful failure by You to perform your duties for the Company if such failure to perform is not cured by You within ten (10) days
after You receive written notice of such failure; (v) competing with the Company, diversion of any corporate opportunity or other
similar conflict of interest or self-dealing incurring to Your direct or indirect benefit; (vi) gross negligence or intentional
misconduct that results in significant injury to the Company or its affiliates; or (vii) Your death or Disability (as defined
below).  

Disability  
shall mean that You are entitled to receive long-term disability benefits under the long-term disability plan of the Company in
which You participate, or, if there is no such plan, your inability, due to physical or mental incapacity, to substantially perform
Your duties and responsibilities under this Agreement for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.  

Good
Reason   shall mean the occurrence, without Your express prior written consent, of any one or more of the following:  

(1)         A
material breach of this Agreement by the Company;  

(2)         Your
duties or responsibilities are materially diminished or You are assigned duties that are inconsistent with the duties then currently
performed by You;  

(3)          The
Company's requiring You to work principally from an office located in excess of forty (40) miles from Your home in Wayne, New
Jersey, except for required travel on the Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with Your position;  

2  

(4)          A
material reduction by the Company of Your Base Salary, except to the extent ratably consistent with reductions applied to the
base salaries of all the Company's executive officers; or  

(5)          The
initiation of insolvency proceedings or the voluntary or  involuntary filing of a petition for bankruptcy or similar reorganization
of the Company. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Your resignation as a result of any of the foregoing conditions shall be considered a voluntary resignation by
You unless You shall have provided written notification to the Company of the condition(s) allegedly constituting Good Reason
and Company shall have failed to correct such condition(s) within ten (10) days after Company's receipt of such notice;  provided,
 that Your resignation occurs on or prior to the earliest to occur of (i) the correction of the condition(s) allegedly constituting
Good Reason and (ii) the date that is six (6) months following the initial existence of the occurrence of the applicable event
or condition claimed to constitute  Good Reason .  

2.
Except as otherwise set forth herein the Agreement will remain unmodified and in full force and effect
