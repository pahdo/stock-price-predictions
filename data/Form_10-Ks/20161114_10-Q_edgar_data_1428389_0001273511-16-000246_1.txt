1.  
  Description of Business  
   
 Blox, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated on July 21, 2005 under the laws of the state of Nevada. The address of the Company is #1500, 701 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V7Y 1C6, Canada. The Company is primarily engaged in developing mineral exploration projects in Africa. 
   
 On February 27, 2014, the Company completed a business combination with International Eco Endeavors Corp. ( Eco Endeavors ) which has now been renamed  Blox Energy Inc.   During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company discontinued operations in Europe and disposed of Blox Energy Inc. s subsidiary, Kenderesh Endeavors Corp. 
   
  2.  
  Basis of Presentation  
   
  (a)  
  Statement of Compliance  
   
 These condensed interim consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( US GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company's fiscal year-end is March 31. 
   
  (b)  
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries. These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.  These consolidated financial statements have also been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, except for cash flow information.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring ones), considered necessary for fair value have been included in these financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year ending March 31, 2017, or future operating periods. For further information, see the Company s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016, including the accounting policies and notes thereto.  
   
  (c)  
  Going Concern  
   
 These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a net loss of $216,388 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, and has incurred cumulative losses since inception of $9,141,477. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary debt and/or equity financing to continue operations. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company has undertaken steps as part of a plan to sustain operations for the next fiscal year including plans to raise additional equity financing, controlling costs and reducing operating losses. Waratah Investments Limited, the Company s controlling shareholder agreed to provide a bridge loan to finance the required working capital (Note 7).

3.   
  Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 
   
  4.  
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: 
   
 Level 1   fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
   
 Level 2   fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
   
 Level 3   fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
   
 Financial instruments classified as Level 1   quoted prices in active markets include cash and cash equivalents. 
   
 The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy:

6.  
  Mineral Property Interest   (continued)  
   
 In consideration for the acquisition of the interest in the Property, the Company has paid in cash $100,000 to BGL and $40,000 to EML and issued BGL and EML an aggregate of 6,514,350 shares of common stock of the Company (the  First Tranche Shares ), at a deemed price of $0.1765 per share, for an aggregate deemed value of $1,150,000. The First Tranche Shares were issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively. For accounting purposes, the Company recorded the cash payment of $140,000, and $10,000 for an independent valuation of the property. Additionally, $781,722 was capitalized to mineral property interests, being the fair value of the first tranche of shares. The fair value of the first tranche shares was based on the closing price of the Company s shares on the OTCQB on July 24, 2014. 
   
 Within 14 days of commercial gold production being publicly declared from ore mined from the property, the Company will issue BGL and EML a second tranche of shares of common stock of the Company (the  Second Tranche Shares ). The number of Second Tranche Shares to be issued shall be calculated by dividing $1,150,000 by the volume weighted average share price of the Company's common stock over a 20-day period preceding the issuance date. The Second Tranche Shares shall be issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively. 
   
 Since the 2016 fiscal year, the Company has been working towards on finalizing Mansounia prolongation application and moving into pre-feasibility study phase. On May 6, 2016, the Company arranged the annual claim fee for $5,800 to maintain the property in a good standing.

Item 2.   
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  Overview  
   
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2005, under the name  Nava Resources, Inc.  for the purpose of conducting mineral exploration activities. We were authorized to issue 400,000,000 shares of common stock, having a par value of $0.001 per share.  On January 4, 2007, we obtained written consent from our shareholders to amend our Articles of Incorporation to change the par value of our common stock from $0.001 to $0.00001 per share, which change was effected on February 28, 2007.  Effective July 30, 2013, we changed our name from  Nava Resources, Inc.  to  Blox Inc. . 
   
 On February 27, 2014, we consummated an Amalgamation Agreement (the   Amalgamation Agreement  ) with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ourco Capital Ltd., (  Ourco  ), International Eco Endeavors Corp. (  Eco Endeavors  ), which was incorporated on April 28, 2011 under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Kenderesh Endeavors Corp. (  Kenderesh  ), and Kenderes Biogaz Termelo Korlatolt Fele Lossegu Tarsasag (  Kenderes Biogaz  ), pursuant to which Ourco and Eco Endeavors amalgamated to form Blox Energy Inc. (  Blox Energy  ), pursuant to the provisions of the  Business Corporations Act  (British Columbia).  Blox Energy is a private company incorporated pursuant to the  Business Corporations Act  (British Columbia) and is engaged in the development of renewable energy projects and intends to expand into the provision of renewable energy services.  Kenderes Biogaz was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kenderesh which, in turn, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eco Endeavors. Kenderes Biogaz owned and operated a biogas plant located near Budapest, Hungary. 
   
 Due to uneconomic conditions brought on by political and economic forces in Hungary we deemed it necessary and in the best interest of our company to cease operations at our Kenderes Biogas Plant in Hungary, which has been moved to Africa where we will look to provide energy to mining projects.  We completed the sale of our wholly-owned Hungarian subsidiary and any assets that we deemed to be uneconomical to move were sold off.   
   
 On August 6, 2014, we announced that we entered into a Deed of Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated July 24, 2014 (the   Assumption Agreement  ) with Joseph Boampong Memorial Institute Ltd. (  JBMIL  ) and Equus Mining Ltd. (  EML  ), Burey Gold Guinee sarl (  BGGs  ) and Burey Gold Limited (  BGL  ) and, collectively with EML and BGGs, (the   Vendors  ), pursuant to which we agreed to assume JBMIL's right to acquire a 78% beneficial interest in the Mansounia Concession (the   Mansounia Property  ) from the Vendors. We also announced that we had exercised that right and has acquired a 78% beneficial interest in the Mansounia Property.  
   
 The Mansounia Property lies in the southwest margin of the Siguiri Basin, in the Kouroussa Prefecture, Kankan Region, in Guinea, West Africa and covers a surface area of 145 square kilometres. The Mansounia Property is located approximately 80 kilometres west, by road, from the country's third largest city, Kankan. 
   
 An exploration permit for the Mansounia Property was granted by the Minist re des Mines et de la G ologie on August 20, 2013. As part of our due diligence, we obtained a legal opinion which confirmed that the license remains in good standing. It is our intention to obtain an exploitation permit, which would give us the exclusive right to mine and dispose of minerals for 15 years, with a possible 5 year extension. We have commenced work on the feasibility study required for obtaining this permit. 
   
 In consideration for the acquisition of the interest in the Mansounia Property, we paid $107,143to BGL and $42,857to EML and on July 31, 2014, issued BGL and EML an aggregate of 6,514,350 shares of common stock of our company (the   First Tranche Shares  ), at a deemed price of $0.1765 per share, for an aggregate deemed value of $1,150,000. The First Tranche Shares were issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively. For accounting purposes, we recorded the cash payment of $150,000 plus $781,722 as the fair value of the First Tranche Shares in mineral interest. The fair value of the First Tranche Shares was based on the closing price of our shares on the OTCQB on July 24, 2014. 

13 

Within 14 days of commercial gold production being publicly declared from ore mined from the Mansounia Property, we will issue BGL and EML a second tranche of shares of our common stock (the   Second Tranche Shares  ). The number of Second Tranche Shares to be issued shall be calculated by dividing $1,150,000 by the volume weighted average share price of our common stock over a 20 day period preceding the issuance date. The Second Tranche Shares shall be issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively. 
   
  Going Concern   
   
 Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. We have incurred a net loss of $216,388 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, and have incurred cumulative losses since inception of $9,141,477. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to continue obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations.  
   
 We will need to raise additional funds to finance continuing operations. However, there are no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional funds. Without sufficient additional financing, it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in this annual report and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. 
   
  Results of Operations   
   
  Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
   
 The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated interim financial statements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which are included herein. 
   
  Expenses  
   
 The expenses were as follows: 

We incurred a net loss of $101,971 and $216,388 ($0.00 per share) for the three and six month ended September 30, 2016, compared to $637,573 and $794,341 ($0.01 loss per share), in the same periods in 2015. In the quarter ended September 30, 2015, $542,146 of non-cash stock based compensation expenses were incurred and there was increased activity as a result of management s activities in Mansounia. 

14 

The increase in consulting and professional fees of $90,996 and $182,268   during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $82,033 and $147,950   during the same quarters in 2015 relates to additional consultants retained.  Total office and administration expense incurred was $10,500 and $22,574   during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $14,327  and  $37,900 during   the same periods in 2015 due primarily to the outsourcing of administrative support. 
   
 Stock based compensation expensed was $ Nil  for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $542,146 and $597,913 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. During the period ended September 30, 2015, we granted a stock option to one director and options granted to previous directors and officers were forfeited during the three months ended September 30, 2015.    
   
 Management anticipates operating expenses will materially increase in future periods as we focus on green mineral development and incur increased costs as a result of being a public company with a class of securities registered under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
  Working Capital   

Current Assets   
   
 The nominal increase in current assets as of September 30, 2016 compared to March 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in cash from $8,944 to $9,423, and an increase in prepaid expenses from $9,341 to $13,174.   
   
  Current Liabilities    
   
 Current liabilities as at September 30, 2016 increased by $220,149 since March 31, 2016, primarily due to a shareholder financing the working capital for the first two quarters for $234,264.  
   
  Cash Flow   
   
 Our cash flow was as follows:  

Operating activities  
   
 The increase in net cash used in operating activities for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015 was primarily as a result of increased activities during fiscal 2016 and share based compensation and share issued for services accounted for during the six months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
    Investing activities   
   
 There is no cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015.   

15 

Financing activities   
   
 The increased net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly attributable to the proceeds from a loan provided by a shareholder. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
 There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 
   
  Cash Requirements   
   
 Our current cash position is not sufficient to meet our present and near-term cash needs.  We will require additional cash resources, including the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  For the next 12 months we estimate that our capital needs will be $250,000 to $500,000 and we currently have approximately $630 in cash.   We will seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders. 
   
  Contractual Obligations  
   
 Not applicable.

  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

  Item 4.   
  Controls and Procedures  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
