CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  
   
 Various statements in this report contain or may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements were based on various factors and were derived from utilizing numerous assumptions and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

our recent exit from shell status, lack of profitable operations and risk we will ever generate revenues or profits, 

need for additional capital, including our ability to repay $604,500 in notes to non-related parties, a substantial portion of which are presently past due, 

our ability to continue as a going concern, 

the limited operating history of our business, 

our inability to manage our growth, 

potential infringement of first party intellectual property rights, 

our ability to effectively compete, 

our ability to timely and effectively scale our technology, 

the limited trading market for our common stock which is quoted on the OTC Markets, 

anti-takeover aspects of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the ability of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder consent, 

the application of penny stock rules to trading in our common stock, and 

the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible notes and warrants. 
   
 You should read thoroughly this report and the documents that we refer to herein with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and/or worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements including those made in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing elsewhere in this report. Other sections of this report include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and you should not rely on these statements without also considering the risks and uncertainties associated with these statements and our business.

MICHAEL JAMES ENTERPRISES, INC.  
  (formerly BullsnBears.com, Inc.)  
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements 
   
  1.  
  Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business  
   
 The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Michael James Enterprises, Inc. (formerly BullsnBears.com, Inc.) (the  Company ) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). We suggest that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC. We believe that all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein and that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in Form 10-K have been omitted. 
   
 On December 31, 2015, the Company formed a new wholly-owned corporation, BullsnBears Holdings, Inc., for the purpose of holding the Company s intellectual property assets. 
   
 The financial statements presented are those of Michael James Enterprises, Inc. (formerly BullsnBears.com, Inc.) (the Company) (formerly Spicy Gourmet Manufacturing, Inc.), a Delaware corporation. The Company was incorporated on December 30, 2010, under the laws of the State of Delaware. During November 2012, The Company changed its name from Spicy Gourmet Manufacturing, Inc. to BullsnBears.com, Inc. and changed its name to Michael James Enterprises, Inc.  
   
 Going Concern 
   
 These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period from inception through September 30, 2016, the Company has generated minimal revenues and has an accumulated deficit of $4,346,589 The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, its ability to generate profits from the Company s future operations, identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

8 

Principles of Consolidation  
 The accompanying financial statements reflect the consolidation of the individual financial statements of Michael James Enterprises, Inc. and BullsnBears Holdings, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
  Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share  
 The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including convertible debt, stock options, and warrants, using the treasury stock method, and convertible securities, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company had net losses as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, so the diluted EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares in the diluted EPS because their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase 5,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company also had outstanding convertible notes that could be converted into additional shares.   
  Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The carrying amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The fair value of the derivative liabilities have been valued using a Black Scholes valuation model. 
  Derivative Liabilities  
 Certain of the Company s convertible notes payable described in Note 3 contain conversion features that qualify for embedded derivative classification. The Company accounts for the embedded derivative features in its convertible debentures in accordance FASB ASC 815-10- Derivatives and Hedging,  which requires a periodic valuation of their fair value and a corresponding recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives. The recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of the convertible debt is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance as a debt discount, at the date of issuance, and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as a  Loss on Derivative Liability  in other expense. The fair value of these liabilities will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments. 
   
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-15  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern,  outlining management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, along with the required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact to our financial statements as a result of this change. 
   
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements, by requiring them to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. There is no change to the current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. For public business entities, ASU 2015-03 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

9 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01 on its financial statements. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including treatment of excess tax benefits and forfeitures, as well as consideration of minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. The ASU will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is evaluating the future impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements. 
   
 Other relevant recently issued accounting updates are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

   Net Loss   
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company realized net loss of ($832,282) compared with a net loss of ($35,977) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in   net loss was primarily due to the shares issued for consulting of $808,340.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a bank balance of $40 and a working capital deficit of $1,794,384 compared with a cash balance of $300 and working capital deficit of $1,194,014 at December 31, 2015.  
   
 We do not have sufficient capital to pay our operating expenses.  In addition, as of September 30, 2016, there was $360,000 of notes, which have matured and have not converted into common shares. In addition, there are an additional $17,500 principal amount of Bridge notes with a default interest rate of 20% which mature during the next 12 months and $242,000 in convertible notes which mature over the next 2 years.  These notes are unsecured.  We do  

16 

not have sufficient working capital to repay these obligations.  In the absence of the note holders converting to common stock the Company will need to raise additional capital to satisfy these obligations. If we are unable to raise the additional capital necessary to pay our operating expenses and satisfy our obligations, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.  In that event, investors could lose their entire investment in our company. 
   
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used ($44,469) of cash from operating activities compared with use of ($28,569) of cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
   
   Cash Flows from Financing Activities

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 
   
   Future Financings   
   
 We will continue to rely on the issuance of debt and equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.

ITEM 3.    
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  
   
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act  ) and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
   
  ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  
   
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures    
   
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive who also serves as our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
   
 Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer who also serves as our chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer who also serves as our chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of continuing weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting  
   
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
