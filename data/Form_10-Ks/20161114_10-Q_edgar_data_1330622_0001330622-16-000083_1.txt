1. 
    ORGANIZATION 
     KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on June 13, 2005 as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ).  Substantially all of the Company s assets are held by, and the Company conducts substantially all of its operations through, KBS Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), and its subsidiaries.  The Company is the sole general partner of and directly owns a   99%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, KBS REIT Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( KBS REIT Holdings ), owns the remaining   1%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and is its sole limited partner. 
  The Company invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned or, with respect to a limited number of properties, held a leasehold interest in,   186   real estate properties (of which   12   properties were held for sale, all of which were GKK Properties (defined below)), including the GKK Properties.  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   three   real estate loans receivable and a participation interest with respect to a real estate joint venture. 
  On September 1, 2011, the Company, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively,  KBS ), entered into a Collateral Transfer and Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with, among other parties, GKK Stars Acquisition LLC ( GKK Stars ), the wholly owned subsidiary of Gramercy Property Trust, Inc. ( Gramercy ) that indirectly owned the Gramercy real estate portfolio, to effect the orderly transfer of certain assets and liabilities of the Gramercy real estate portfolio to KBS in satisfaction of certain debt obligations under a mezzanine loan owed by wholly owned subsidiaries of Gramercy to KBS (the  GKK Mezzanine Loan ).  The Settlement Agreement resulted in the transfer of the equity interests in certain subsidiaries of Gramercy (the  Equity Interests ) that indirectly owned or, with respect to a limited number of properties, held a leasehold interest in,   867   properties (the  GKK Properties ), consisting of   576   bank branch properties and   291   office buildings, operations centers and other properties.  As of December 15, 2011, GKK Stars had transferred all of the Equity Interests to the Company, giving the Company title to or, with respect to a limited number of GKK Properties, a leasehold interest in,   867   GKK Properties as of that date.   
  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the business of the Company is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of the Company, pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Company (the  Advisory Agreement ) in effect through November 8, 2017.  The Advisory Agreement may be renewed for an unlimited number of   one  -year periods upon the mutual consent of the Advisor and the Company.  Either party may terminate the Advisory Agreement upon   60   days written notice.  The Advisor owns   20,000   shares of the Company s common stock. 
  Upon commencing its initial public offering (the  Offering ), the Company retained KBS Capital Markets Group LLC (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Advisor, to serve as the dealer manager of the Offering pursuant to a dealer manager agreement dated January 27, 2006 (the  Dealer Manager Agreement ).  The Company ceased offering shares of common stock in its primary offering on May 30, 2008.  The Company terminated its dividend reinvestment plan effective April 10, 2012. 
  The Company sold   171,109,494   shares of common stock in its primary offering for gross offering proceeds of   $1.7 billion  .  The Company sold   28,306,086   shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of   $233.7 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had redeemed   14,221,143   of the shares sold in the Offering for   $96.5 million  .

Asset Management Services Agreement Related to the GKK Properties 
  On December 19, 2013, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary ( KBS Acquisition Sub ), entered into an amended and restated asset management services agreement (the  Amended Services Agreement ) with GKK Realty Advisors LLC (the  Property Manager ), an affiliate of Gramercy, with respect to the GKK Properties.  The effective date of the Amended Services Agreement was December 1, 2013.  Pursuant to the Amended Services Agreement, the Property Manager agreed to provide, among other services: standard asset management services, assistance related to dispositions, accounting services and budgeting and business plans for the GKK Properties (the  Services ).  The Property Manager is not affiliated with the Company or KBS Acquisition Sub.  As compensation for the Services, the Company agreed to pay the Property Manager: (i) an annual fee of   $7.5 million   plus all GKK Property-related expenses incurred by the Property Manager, (ii) subject to certain terms and conditions in the Amended Services Agreement, a profit participation interest based on a percentage (ranging from   10%   to   30%  ) of the amount by which the gross fair market value or gross sales price of certain identified portfolios of GKK Properties exceeds the sum of (a) an agreed-upon baseline value for such GKK Property portfolios plus (b) new capital expended to increase the value of GKK Properties within the portfolios and expenditures made to pay for tenant improvements and leasing commissions related to these GKK Properties as of the measurement date, and (iii) a monthly construction oversight fee equal to a percentage of construction costs for certain construction projects at the GKK Properties overseen by the Property Manager.  
  On June 29, 2016, KBS Acquisition Sub entered into two agreements, a second amended and restated asset management services agreement (the  Second Amended Services Agreement ) and an accounting/construction services agreement (the  Accounting/Construction Services Agreement ), with the Property Manager.  The effective date of both the Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement was June 1, 2016.  Combined, the Services and the key terms and compensation for the Services under the Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement are the same as those of the prior Amended Services Agreement; the two agreements allocate the Services and the compensation between asset management services and accounting/construction services.  The Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement supersede and replace all prior agreements related to the Services among the Company and its affiliates and the Property Manager and its affiliates.  The Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement will terminate on December 31, 2016, with a   one  -year extension option at the Company s option, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the agreements.  On June 29, 2016,  the Property Manager assigned the Second Amended Services Agreement to an affiliate, GPT Realty Management LP, an entity controlled by Gramercy. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company accrued   $19.1 million   of estimated profit participation interest related to the GKK Properties under the Second Amended Services Agreement. 
   
           2.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results for such periods.  Operating results for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .   
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, KBS REIT Holdings, the Operating Partnership and their direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts in the Company s prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations of prior periods. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold   179   properties (  177   of which were GKK Properties).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had classified   12   properties as held for sale, all of which were GKK Properties.  As a result, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified to held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.  
  Per Share Data 
  Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period.  Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock equals basic net income (loss) per share of common stock, as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Distributions declared per share of common stock were   $0.025   and   $0.075   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.025   and   $0.075   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Distributions per share of common stock were based on a quarterly record date for each quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Segments 
  The Company s segments are based on the Company s method of internal reporting, which classifies its operations by investment type: (i) real estate, (ii) real estate-related and (iii) commercial properties primarily leased to financial institutions received under the Settlement Agreement, the GKK Properties.  For financial data by segment, see Note 11,  Segment Information.  
  Square Footage, Occupancy and Other Measures 
   Any references to square footage, occupancy or annualized base rent are unaudited and outside the scope of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm s review of the Company s financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Update 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU No. 2014-09 ).  ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)   and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  ASU No. 2014-09 does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of   Leases (Topic 840).    ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early application not permitted.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU No. 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year.  Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 on its financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-40)  ,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU No. 2014-15 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2014-15 require management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or are available to be issued when applicable) and, if so, provide related disclosures.  ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU No. 2016-01 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  ASU No. 2016-01 primarily affects accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected.  ASU No. 2016-01 also requires entities to present financial assets and financial liabilities separately, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset in the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU No. 2016-02 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 change the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted.  The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ( ASU No. 2016-13 ).  ASU No. 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-13 require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.  ASU No. 2016-13 also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale securities.  An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as is currently required.   ASU No. 2016-13 also requires new disclosures.  For financial assets measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to disclose information about how it developed its allowance for credit losses, including changes in the factors that influenced management s estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes.  For financing receivables and net investments in leases measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to further disaggregate the information it currently discloses about the credit quality of these assets by year of the asset s origination for as many as five annual periods. For available for sale securities, an entity will be required to provide a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses and an aging analysis for securities that are past due.  ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU No. 2016-15 ).  ASU No. 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, including the following that are or may be relevant to the Company:  (a) Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; (b) Cash payments relating to contingent consideration made soon after an acquisition s consummation date (i.e., approximately three months or less) should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities. Payments made thereafter should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the original contingent consideration liability. Payments made in excess of the amount of the original contingent consideration liability should be classified as cash outflows for operating activities; (c) Cash payments received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss (or each component loss, if an entity receives a lump-sum settlement); (d) In the absence of specific guidance, an entity should classify each separately identifiable cash source and use on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. For cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated, the classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-15 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

  The Company s real estate assets are leased to tenants under operating leases for which the terms and expirations vary.      As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s leases, including those related to the GKK Properties, held for investment and excluding options to extend,     had remaining terms of up to   13.8   years with a weighted-average remaining term of   3.9   years.  As of   September 30, 2016  , leases related to the GKK Properties, excluding options to extend, had remaining terms of up to   9.8   years with a weighted-average remaining term of   3.1   years.  Some of the Company s leases have provisions to extend the term of the leases, options for early termination for all or a part of the leased premises after paying a specified penalty, rights of first refusal to purchase the property at competitive market rates, and other terms and conditions as negotiated.  The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants.  Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires a security deposit from the tenant in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit.  The amount required as a security deposit varies depending upon the terms of the respective lease and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally is not a significant amount.  Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit.  Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $2.7 million   and   $3.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized deferred rent from tenants of   $1.2 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively.  These amounts for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were net of   $0.9 million   and   $1.0 million   of lease incentive amortization, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cumulative deferred rent balance was   $21.3 million   and   $19.4 million  , respectively, and is included in rents and other receivables on the accompanying balance sheets. The cumulative deferred rent balance included   $4.8 million   and   $4.7 million   of unamortized lease incentives as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company records property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred. 
  The future minimum rental income from the Company s properties held for investment under non-cancelable operating leases, including leases subject to shedding rights and excluding options to extend, as of   September 30, 2016   for the years ending December 31 is as follows (in thousands): 

Under certain of the Company s leases, tenants reimburse the Company for their proportionate share of the costs the Company incurs to manage, operate and maintain the buildings and properties where they rent space.  These leases often limit the types and amounts of expenses the Company can pass through to its tenants and allow the tenants to audit and contest the determination of the operating expenses they are required to pay.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had recorded liabilities of approximately   $3.2 million   related to potential loss contingencies associated with certain claimed amounts relating to tenant reimbursement audits.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s highest tenant industry concentrations (greater than 10% of annualized base rent) were as follows: 

_____________________ 
   (1)     Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of   September 30, 2016  , adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease's inception through the balance of the lease term.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , no other tenant industries accounted for more than 10% of the Company s annualized base rent. The Company currently has over   200   tenants over a diverse range of industries and geographical regions.      As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a bad debt expense reserve of   $0.5 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively.     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded bad debt expense related to its tenant receivables of   $0.1 million   and   $38,000  , respectively.

  No other tenant represented more than 10% of the Company s annualized base rent. 
  Geographic Concentration Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s net investments in real estate in Virginia represented   14.6%   of the Company s total assets.  As a result, the geographic concentration of the Company s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in Virginia s real estate market.  Any adverse economic or real estate developments in this market, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office or bank branch space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect the Company s operating results. 
  Impairment of Real Estate 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $4.1 million  , of which   $3.7 million   relates to   15   GKK properties classified as real estate held for investment, to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated fair values and   $0.4 million   with respect to   three   GKK Properties that were held for sale to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated sales price less estimated costs to sell.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $29.6 million  , of which   $25.4 million   related to   47   properties classified as real estate held for investment (including   44   GKK Properties), to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated fair values and   $4.2 million   with respect to   13   GKK Properties that were held for sale or sold to write-down the carrying values of these real estate     investments to their estimated sales price less estimated costs to sell.  See Note 6,  Real Estate Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,  for information regarding impairments of assets related to real estate held for sale or sold. The facts and circumstances leading to the impairments on the Company s real estate held for investment are as follows: 
  City Gate Plaza 
  The Company recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $3.3 million   to reduce the carrying value of the Company s investment in City Gate Plaza, an office property located in Sacramento, California, to its estimated fair value. The Company revised its cash flow projections to account for higher projected leasing costs to stabilize the property. The continued lack of demand in the Sacramento office rental market also resulted in higher capitalization rates.  
  University Park Buildings 
  The Company recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $3.2 million   to reduce the carrying value of the Company s investment in the University Park Buildings, an office property located in Sacramento, California, to its estimated fair value. The Company revised its cash flow projections primarily to account for higher projected capital costs for general building upgrades and to address certain maintenance issues.  The continued lack of demand in the Sacramento office rental market also resulted in higher capitalization rates.

ADP Plaza 
  The Company recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $1.7 million   to reduce the carrying value of the Company s investment in ADP Plaza, an office property located in Portland, Oregon, to its estimated fair value.  The Company revised its cash flow projections due to an increase in projected vacancy as a tenant occupying   48.6%   of the building s rentable square feet notified the Company that it will exercise its contraction option as early as January 2017, resulting in a decrease in projected cash flows.     
  GKK Properties 
  Citizens Bank Portfolio  
  The Company recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $10.8 million   relating to   20   properties in the Citizens Bank Portfolio due to a decrease in cash flow projections primarily due to an increase in projected vacancy, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate.  
  Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Portfolio  
  The Company recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $3.0 million   relating to   13   properties in the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Portfolio due to a decrease in cash flow projections primarily due to an increase in projected vacancy, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate. 
  Other Properties 
  The Company recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $3.4 million   relating to   11   other GKK Properties classified as held for investment. No impairment charge related to any individual property was greater than   $800,000  .  These impairments generally resulted from changes in lease projections, including longer estimated lease-up periods and lower projected rental rates, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate.

For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest income from real estate loans receivable consisted of the following (in thousands): 

The Company generally recognizes income on impaired loans on either a cash basis, where interest income is only recorded when received in cash, or on a cost-recovery basis, where all cash receipts are applied against the carrying value of the loan.  The Company will resume the accrual of interest if it determines the collection of interest according to the contractual terms of the loan is probable.  The Company considers the collectibility of the loan s principal balance in determining whether to recognize income on impaired loans on a cash basis or a cost-recovery basis.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrower under the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan was delinquent.  Beginning in July 2014, interest income received on the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan was recorded on a cost-recovery basis.

On September 1, 2015, the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination matured without repayment and the Company began recognizing interest income on a cash basis.  On May 13, 2016, the Company received a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due to it under its investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination and received title to the collateral that secured the loan.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized interest income of   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million   on the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination, respectively.

Defeasance of the Bank of America - BBD2 Mortgage Loan 
  On April 15, 2016, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a defeasance agreement with the lender under the Bank of America - BBD2 Mortgage Loan to defease the remaining outstanding principal balance of   $65.1 million  , releasing all the properties that secured the Bank of America - BBD2 Mortgage Loan.  The defeasance costs and write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately   $12.7 million  . 
  Early Pay-off of the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Mortgage Loan 
  On September 1, 2016, the Company repaid the entire   $36.2 million   principal balance and all other sums due on the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Mortgage Loan and paid a prepayment premium of   $6.5 million  .  The prepayment premium and write-off of an unamortized discount resulted in an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately   $7.0 million  . 
  Debt Covenants  
  The documents evidencing the Company s outstanding debt obligations typically require that specified loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios be maintained with respect to the financed properties.  A breach of the financial covenants in these documents may result in the lender imposing additional restrictions on the Company s operations, such as restrictions on the Company s ability to incur additional debt, or may allow the lender to impose  cash traps  with respect to cash flow from the property securing the loan.  In addition, such a breach may constitute an event of default and the lender could require the Company to repay the debt immediately.  If the Company fails to make such repayment in a timely manner, the lender may be entitled to take possession of any property securing the loan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these debt covenants. 
   
           8. 
    FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
     Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.  In  addition, the Company is required to measure other non-financial and financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets).  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach.  Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 
                
    Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
     The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes, pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment.  The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company s financial instruments.  Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and for which markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments for which markets are inactive or consist of non-orderly trades.  The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly.  The following is a summary of the methods and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value: 
  Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rent and other receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities:   These balances approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items.

Real estate loans receivable:   These instruments are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their amortized cost net of recorded loan loss reserves and not at fair value.  The fair values of real estate loans receivable were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected cash flows for the loans, underlying collateral values (for collateral-dependent loans) and estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs. 
  Notes payable:   The fair values of the Company s notes payable are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  Additionally, when determining the fair value of a liability in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, the Company measures fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs. 
  The following were the face values, carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s real estate loans receivable and notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which carrying amounts generally do not approximate the fair values (in thousands): 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Carrying amount of real estate loans receivable includes loan loss reserves. 
  Disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company as of the period end and requires a significant amount of judgment.  Low levels of transaction volume for certain financial instruments have made the estimation of fair values difficult and, therefore, both the actual results and the Company s estimate of value at a future date could be materially different.

Assets Recorded at Fair Value 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company measured the following assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in thousands): 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Amounts represent the aggregate fair value for real estate assets impacted by impairment charges during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , as of the date that the fair value measurements were made.  The carrying value for these real estate assets may have subsequently increased or decreased from the fair value reflected due to activity that has occurred since the measurement date. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , certain of the Company s real estate properties held for investment were measured at estimated fair value as these properties were impaired and the carrying values of these properties were adjusted to estimated fair values.  The Company estimated the fair value for the impaired real estate properties held for investment by performing a 10-year discounted cash flow analysis.  The range of the terminal capitalization rates used to estimate the fair values for these properties was   7.00%   to   10.75%  .  See Note 3,  Real Estate Held for Investment   Impairment of Real Estate,  for information regarding impairments related to real estate held for investment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , certain of the Company s real estate properties held for sale and sold were measured at estimated fair value as these properties were impaired and the carrying values of these properties were adjusted to estimated fair value.  The Company estimated the fair value for these impaired real estate properties held for sale and sold based on an estimated sales price, less estimated costs to sell.  
   
           9. 
    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
     The Company has entered into an Advisory Agreement with the Advisor, which entitles the Advisor to specified fees for the management and disposition of investments, among other services, as well as to reimbursement for certain costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company.  In addition, the Advisor is entitled to certain other fees, including an incentive fee upon achieving certain performance goals, as detailed in the Advisory Agreement.  The Company has also entered into a fee reimbursement agreement (the  AIP Reimbursement Agreement ) with the Dealer Manager pursuant to which the Company agreed to reimburse the Dealer Manager for certain fees and expenses it incurs for administering the Company s participation in the DTCC Alternative Investment Product Platform with respect to certain accounts of the Company s investors serviced through the platform.  The Advisor also serves, and the Dealer Manager also serves or served, as the advisor and dealer manager, respectively, for KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and KBS Growth   Income REIT, Inc.

On January 6, 2014, the Company, together with KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc., the Dealer Manager, the Advisor and other KBS-affiliated entities, entered into an errors and omissions and directors and officers liability insurance program where the lower tiers of such insurance coverage are shared.  The cost of these lower tiers is allocated by the Advisor and its insurance broker among each of the various entities covered by the program, and is billed directly to each entity.  The allocation of these shared coverage costs is proportionate to the pricing by the insurance marketplace for the first tiers of directors and officers liability coverage purchased individually by each REIT.  The Advisor s and the Dealer Manager s portion of the shared lower tiers  cost is proportionate to the respective entities  prior cost for the errors and omissions insurance.  In June 2015, KBS Growth   Income REIT, Inc. was added to the insurance program at terms similar to those described above.  The insurance program was renewed and is effective through June 30, 2017. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no other business transactions occurred between the Company and the other KBS-sponsored programs.  On May 18, 2012, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. made an   $8.0 million   investment in a joint venture in which the Company indirectly owns a participation interest through another joint venture investment.  
  Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the AIP Reimbursement Agreement, summarized below are the related-party costs incurred by the Company for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and any related amounts payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

_____________________ 
   (1)    See  Asset Management Fee for GKK Properties  below.  
   (2)    Reimbursable operating expenses primarily consists of internal audit personnel costs, accounting software and cybersecurity related expenses incurred by the Advisor under the Advisory Agreement.  The Company reimburses the Advisor for the Company s allocable portion of the salaries, benefits and overhead of internal audit department personnel providing services to the Company.  These amounts totaled   $76,000   and   $51,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $218,000   and   $146,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These were the only type of employee costs reimbursed under the Advisory Agreement for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The Company will not reimburse for employee costs in connection with services for which the Advisor earns disposition fees (other than reimbursement of travel and communication expenses) or for the salaries or benefits the Advisor or its affiliates may pay to the Company s executive officers.  In addition to the amounts above, the Company reimburses the Advisor for certain of the Company s direct costs incurred from third parties that were initially paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company. 
   (3)    Disposition fees with respect to real estate sold are included in the gain (loss) on sales of real estate in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  See also    Modification of Disposition Fee Related to GKK Properties  below. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor reimbursed the Company   $36,000   for a property insurance rebate and   $69,000   for legal and professional fees.

Asset Management Fee for GKK Properties 
  Among the fees payable to the Advisor is an asset management fee.  With respect to investments in real estate, the Company pays the Advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of   0.75%   of the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property.  This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition fees and expenses related thereto. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee is determined based on the Company s proportionate share of the underlying investment.  
  With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real estate, the Company pays our advisor a monthly asset management fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of   0.75%   of the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination fees and expenses related thereto) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation.  
  With respect to an investment that has suffered an impairment in value, reduction in cash flow or other negative circumstances, such investment may either be excluded from the calculation of the asset management fee described above or included in such calculation at a reduced value that is recommended by the Advisor and Company s management and then approved by a majority of its independent directors, and this change in the fee shall be applicable to an investment upon the earlier to occur of the date on which (i) such investment is sold, (ii) such investment is surrendered to a person other than the company, its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary or a joint venture or partnership in which it has an interest, (iii) the Advisor determines that it will no longer pursue collection or other remedies related to such investment, or (iv) the Advisor recommends a revised fee arrangement with respect to such investment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company excluded its interest in an unconsolidated joint venture from the calculation of asset management fees.  Through March 31, 2016, the Company calculated the asset management fee for the GKK Properties based on the original cost of its investment in the GKK Mezzanine Loan, rather than on the gross value of the GKK Properties it owns or in which it holds a leasehold interest.  Beginning in April 2016, the gross value of the GKK Properties fell below the original cost of the Company s investment in the GKK Mezzanine Loan and for the period from April 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016  , the Company calculated the asset management fee for these properties based on the gross value of the GKK Properties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had not determined to calculate the asset management fee at an adjusted value for any other investments or to exclude any other investments from the calculation of the asset management fee. 
  Modification of Disposition Fee Related to GKK Properties 
  In accordance with the Advisory Agreement, for substantial assistance in connection with the sale of properties, loans or other investments as determined by the conflicts committee of the Company s board of directors, the Company pays the Advisor or its affiliates a disposition fee of   1%   of the contract sales price of the properties, loans or other investments sold. However, in no event may the total commissions (including such disposition fees) paid to the Advisor, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed   6%   of the contract sales price of the property, loan or other investment sold or exceed a competitive real estate commission.  
  Prior to August 9, 2016, notwithstanding the foregoing, in January 2015, the disposition fee related to the sales of GKK Properties was modified to provide that the conflicts committee would determine in its sole discretion the amount of the disposition fee related to the sale of GKK Properties upon the terms set forth below, which disposition fee may be an amount not to exceed   1%   of the contract sales price, which maximum amount is consistent with the fixed percentage applicable to the sales of other properties, loans and other investments.

With respect to sales of the GKK Properties, and provided that the conflicts committee determined that the Advisor had provided a substantial amount of services in connection with the sale of each GKK Property for which the payment of a disposition fee was requested by the Advisor, then: 
           (a) 
    With respect to portfolio or single asset sales of GKK Properties designated by the conflicts committee in its sole discretion at or about the time of the sale, the Company would pay the Advisor a fee in an amount not to exceed   1%   of the contract sales price and subject to other limitations and conditions set forth in the Advisory Agreement, as determined by the conflicts committee in its sole discretion, which fee would be payable upon the respective closing; and 
              (b) 
    With respect to sales of all other GKK Properties for which a disposition fee had not yet been paid, if, upon the sale of the final GKK Property, the conflicts committee determined in its sole discretion that the Company had recovered its entire investment related to the GKK Mezzanine Loan and the GKK Properties subsequent to the Settlement Agreement, after taking into consideration the net cash flow received by the Company from the investment, whether in the form of (i) net proceeds from the sales or other dispositions or transfers of the GKK Properties, (ii) the net cash flow related to the GKK Mezzanine Loan, (iii) the net cash flow related to the GKK Properties subsequent to the Settlement Agreement and/or (iv) other proceeds related to the assets and liabilities received under the Settlement Agreement, then the Company would pay the Advisor a fee in an amount not to exceed   1%   of the contract sales price and subject to other conditions set forth in the Advisory Agreement, as determined by the conflicts committee in its sole discretion, which fee would be payable promptly upon such determination by the conflicts committee. 
     On August 9, 2016, the Company and the Advisor entered into an amendment ( Amendment No. 1 ) to the Advisory Agreement to amend certain terms related to the disposition fee payable to the Advisor by the Company.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, with respect to sales of GKK Properties for which a disposition fee had not yet been paid as of August 9, 2016, based on the proceeds received from the entire investment related to the GKK Mezzanine Loan and the GKK Properties through August 9, 2016 and expected proceeds from future sales, the conflicts committee determined that the Advisor had provided a substantial amount of services in connection with the sale of each of the   160   GKK Properties named therein and approved the payment to the Advisor of a disposition fee equal to   1.0%   of the aggregate contract sales prices of such GKK Properties, of which the aggregate disposition fee was   $2.0 million  .  The aggregate contract sales price of such   160   GKK Properties was   $214.1 million  .  The   $2.0 million   disposition fee was paid in August 2016 and was included in the gain on sales of real estate, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Also pursuant to Amendment No. 1, for substantial assistance in connection with the sale of all GKK Properties that had not been sold as of August 9, 2016 (as determined by the conflicts committee of the Company s board of directors), the Company will pay the Advisor or its affiliates a disposition fee of   1.0%   of the contract sales price of such GKK Properties sold. However, in no event may the total commissions (including such disposition fees) paid to the Advisor, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed   6%   of the contract sales price of the property, loan or other investment sold or exceed a competitive real estate commission.

    SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW AND SIGNIFICANT NONCASH TRANSACTION DISCLOSURES 
     Supplemental cash flow and significant noncash transaction disclosures were as follows (in thousands): 

11. 
    SEGMENT INFORMATION 
     The Company presently operates in   three   business segments based on its investment types: real estate, real estate-related and commercial properties primarily leased to financial institutions received under the Settlement Agreement, or the GKK Properties.  Under the real estate segment, the Company has invested primarily in office and industrial properties located throughout the United States.  The real estate segment excludes all real estate properties that were classified as discontinued operations.  Under the real estate-related segment, the Company has invested in or originated mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and other real estate-related assets, including real estate securities.  The GKK Properties segment consists of primarily office properties, bank branch properties, operations centers and other properties located in   20   states but excludes GKK Properties that were classified as discontinued operations.  All revenues earned from the Company s three reporting segments were from external customers and there were no intersegment sales or transfers.  The Company does not allocate corporate-level accounts to its reporting segments.  Corporate-level accounts include corporate general and administrative expenses, asset management fees, non-operating interest income and other corporate-level expenses.  The accounting policies of the reporting segments are consistent with those described in Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  
  The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based upon net operating income from continuing operations ( NOI ), which is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure.  The Company defines NOI for its real estate segment and the GKK Properties segment as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements and other operating income) less property and related expenses (property operating expenses, real estate taxes, insurance and provision for bad debt) less interest expense.  The Company defines NOI for its real estate-related segment as interest income and income from its unconsolidated joint venture investment less loan servicing costs (if applicable) and interest expense (if applicable).  NOI excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of an asset such as non-property income and expenses, depreciation and amortization, asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses.  The Company uses NOI to evaluate the operating performance of the Company s real estate investments, real estate-related investments and the GKK Properties and to make decisions about resource allocations.  The Company believes that net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to NOI; however, NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance as it excludes the items described above.  Additionally, NOI as defined above may not be comparable to other REITs or companies as their definitions of NOI may differ from the Company s definition. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company revised its definition of NOI to exclude asset management fees, which the Company does not consider to be controllable in connection with the management of each property or real estate-related asset and is viewed by the chief operating decision makers as a corporate-level administrative expense.  NOI for all prior periods presented has been adjusted to conform to the current period definition.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
     Lease Obligations 
  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company indirectly received leasehold interests in certain commercial properties, pursuant to leases between the owner of the property, as landlord, and the Company, as tenant.  The ground leases have expiration dates from 2019 through 2058 and the building leases have expiration dates from 2016 through 2085.  These lease obligations generally contain rent increases and renewal options.  In certain instances, the rent owed by the Company to the owner of the property under the lease is greater than the revenue received by the Company from the tenants occupying the property. 
  Future minimum lease payments owed by the Company under non-cancelable operating building and ground leases as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

If the Company were to dispose of an asset that is subject to a ground lease, the Company may incur additional losses to settle obligations related to the ground lease.

Economic Dependency 
  The Company is dependent on the Advisor for certain services that are essential to the Company, including the management of the Company s real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio; the disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments; and other general and administrative responsibilities.  In the event that the Advisor is unable to provide any of these services, the Company will be required to obtain such services from other sources.  The Company is also dependent on GPT Realty Management LP and the Property Manager for the Services under the Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement, including the operations, leasing and eventual dispositions of the GKK Properties. 
  Environmental 
  As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.  Although there can be no assurance, the Company is not aware of any environmental liability that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.  However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the Company s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to the properties could result in future environmental liabilities. 
  Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company indirectly took title to or, with respect to a limited number of the GKK Properties, indirectly took a leasehold interest in, the GKK Properties on an  as is  basis.  As such, the Company was not able to inspect the GKK Properties or conduct standard due diligence on certain of the GKK Properties before the transfers of the properties.  Additionally, the Company did not receive representations, warranties and indemnities relating to the GKK Properties from Gramercy and/or its affiliates.  Thus, the value of the GKK Properties may decline if the Company subsequently discovers environmental problems with the GKK Properties. 
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company is party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business.  Management is not aware of any legal proceedings the outcome of which is probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition, which would require accrual or disclosure of the contingency and possible range of loss.  Additionally, the Company has not recorded any loss contingencies related to legal proceedings in which the potential loss is deemed to be remote. 
   
   The Company evaluates subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. 
  Distribution Declared 
  On November 7, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared a distribution in the amount of   $0.025   per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 22, 2016.  The Company expects to pay this distribution on or about December 29, 2016. 
  Plan of Liquidation 
  On October 5, 2016, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to the Company, the board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of the Company s assets and the dissolution of the Company pursuant to the terms of a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution of the Company (the  Plan of Liquidation ).  The principal purpose of the Plan of Liquidation is to maximize stockholder value by selling the Company s assets, paying its debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to the Company s stockholders.  Pursuant to the Company s charter, the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the shares of the Company s common stock entitled to vote on the Plan of Liquidation is required for approval of the Plan of Liquidation. The Company can provide no assurance that the Plan of Liquidation will be approved by the Company s stockholders.

If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by the Company s stockholders, the Company expects to pay multiple liquidating distribution payments to its stockholders during the liquidation process and to pay the final liquidating distribution after the Company sells all of its assets, pays all of its known liabilities and provides for unknown liabilities. The Company expects to complete these activities within   24   months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation; however, there can be no assurances regarding the amounts of any liquidating distributions or the timing thereof. 
  Renewal of Advisory Agreement 
  On November 8, 2016, the Company renewed the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. The renewed Advisory Agreement is effective through November 8, 2017; however, either party may terminate the renewed Advisory Agreement without cause or penalty upon providing   60   days  written notice. The terms of the renewed Advisory Agreement are identical to those of the Advisory Agreement that was previously in effect, including the August 9, 2016 amendment to the previous Advisory Agreement.

  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and the notes thereto.  As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the  Operating Partnership,  and to their subsidiaries. 
   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as  may,   will,   seeks,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   plans,   intends,   should  or similar expressions.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. 
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    Although our board of directors has approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution (the  Plan of Liquidation ), we can give no assurance whether we will be able to obtain the stockholder approvals required to consummate the Plan of Liquidation or, if we do receive such approval, whether we will be able to successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation and sell our assets, pay our debts and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders as we expect. 
                
    We can give no assurance regarding the timing of asset dispositions and the sale prices we will receive for assets and the amount and timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders. 
                
    We may face unanticipated difficulties, delays or expenditures relating to our implementation of the Plan of Liquidation, which may reduce or delay our payment liquidating distributions. 
                
    We may face risks associated with legal proceedings, including stockholder litigation, that may be instituted against us related to the Plan of Liquidation. 
                
    We are the first publicly offered investment program sponsored by the affiliates of our external advisor, KBS Capital Advisors LLC (  KBS Capital Advisors ), which makes our future performance difficult to predict.  Our stockholders should not assume that our performance will be similar to the past performance of other real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of our advisor.   
                
    All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, the entity that acted as our dealer manager and/or other KBS-affiliated entities.  As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors.  These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions. 
                
    We pay substantial fees to and expenses of our advisor and its affiliates.  These payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us and increase the risk of loss to our stockholders. 
                
    We depend on tenants for the revenue generated by our real estate investments and, accordingly, the revenue generated by our real estate investments is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants.  Revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in occupancy (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and reducing our stockholders  returns. 
                
    We may not be able to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness or to obtain additional debt financing on attractive terms.  If we are not able to refinance existing indebtedness on attractive terms at or prior to its maturity, we may be forced to dispose of our assets sooner than we otherwise would and/or our lenders may take action against us.

Our investments in real estate and real estate loans may be affected by unfavorable real estate market and general economic conditions, which could decrease the value of those assets and reduce the investment return to our stockholders.  Revenues from our real property investments could decrease, making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations.  Revenues from the properties and other assets directly or indirectly securing our loan investments could decrease, making it more difficult for the borrowers under those loans to meet their payment obligations to us.  In addition, decreases in revenues from the properties directly or indirectly securing our loan investments could result in decreased valuations for those properties, which could make it difficult for our borrowers to repay or refinance their obligations to us.  These factors could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and could reduce our stockholders  return. 
                
    Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations and cash needs, reducing the value of our stockholders  investment in us. 
                
    Certain of our debt obligations have variable interest rates and related payments that vary with the movement of LIBOR or other indexes.  Increases in these indexes could increase the amount of our debt payments and reduce our stockholders  return. 
                
    Our share redemption program provides only for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  (each as defined in the share redemption program and, together with redemptions in connection with a stockholder s death,  special redemptions ).  The dollar amounts available for such redemptions are determined by our board of directors and may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time.  Additionally, redemptions are further subject to limitations described in our share redemption program.  We currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future.  
                
    We may not be able to successfully operate and/or sell the GKK Properties (defined below) given the concentration of the GKK Properties in the financial services sector, and our advisor s limited experience operating, managing and selling bank branch properties.  Moreover, we depend upon GKK Realty Advisors LLC (the  Property Manager ), an affiliate of Gramercy (defined below), and GPT Realty Management LP to manage and conduct the operations of the GKK Properties and any adverse changes in or the termination of our relationship with the Property Manager or GPT Realty Management LP could hinder the performance of the GKK Properties and the return on our stockholders  investment in us. 
                
    As a result of the transfer of the GKK Properties to us, a significant portion of our properties are leased to financial institutions, making us more economically vulnerable in the event of a downturn in the banking industry.  
                
    During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company disposed of   34   properties (of which   31   were GKK Properties) and terminated its leasehold interest in   three   GKK Properties. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company disposed of   179   properties (177 of which were GKK Properties).  As a result of our disposition activity, our general and administrative expenses, which are not directly related to the size of our portfolio, have increased significantly as a percentage of our cash flow from operations and will continue to increase to the extent we sell additional assets. 
     All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 16, 2016, and in our Definitive Proxy Statement, as filed with the SEC on November 10, 2016 (the  Proxy Statement ). 
   
  Overview 
  We are a Maryland corporation that was formed on June 13, 2005 to invest in a diverse portfolio of real estate properties and real estate-related investments.  We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2006 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner.  We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors pursuant to an advisory agreement.  Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock.  We have no paid employees. 
  On January 27, 2006, we launched our initial public offering of up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock in our primary offering and 80,000,000 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan.  We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on May 30, 2008.  We terminated our dividend reinvestment plan effective April 10, 2012.  We sold   171,109,494   shares in our primary offering for gross offering proceeds of   $1.7 billion   and   28,306,086   shares under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of   $233.7 million  .

As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned or, with respect to a limited number of properties, held a leasehold interest in,   186   real estate properties (of which   12   properties were held for sale, all of which were GKK Properties), including the GKK Properties.  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   three   real estate loans receivable and a participation interest with respect to a real estate joint venture. 
  On September 1, 2011, we, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively,  KBS ), entered into a Collateral Transfer and Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with, among other parties, GKK Stars Acquisition LLC ( GKK Stars ), the wholly owned subsidiary of Gramercy Property Trust, Inc. ( Gramercy ) that indirectly owned the Gramercy real estate portfolio, to effect the orderly transfer of certain assets and liabilities of the Gramercy real estate portfolio to KBS in satisfaction of certain debt obligations under a mezzanine loan owed by wholly owned subsidiaries of Gramercy to KBS (the  GKK Mezzanine Loan ).  The Settlement Agreement resulted in the transfer of the equity interests in certain subsidiaries of Gramercy (the  Equity Interests ) that indirectly owned or, with respect to a limited number of properties, held a leasehold interest in,   867   properties (the  GKK Properties ), consisting of   576   bank branch properties and   291   office buildings, operations centers and other properties.  For a further discussion of the Settlement Agreement, the transfers of the GKK Properties and the debt related to these properties, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 filed with the SEC. 
  Plan of Liquidation 
  On October 5, 2016, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to us, our board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation.  The principal purpose of the Plan of Liquidation is to maximize stockholder value by selling our assets, paying our debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders.  Pursuant to our charter, the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the Plan of Liquidation is required for approval of the Plan of Liquidation.  We can provide no assurance that the Plan of Liquidation will be approved by our stockholders. 
  If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to pay multiple liquidating distribution payments to our stockholders during the liquidation process and to pay the final liquidating distribution after we sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities and provide for unknown liabilities. We expect to complete these activities within 24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation; however, there can be no assurances regarding the amounts of any liquidating distributions or the timing thereof. 
   
  Market Outlook   Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 
  The following discussion is based on management s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets. 
  Current conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as we near the end of 2016.  Current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving, although at a slow incremental rate. Growth in most advanced economies remains lackluster, with low potential growth expectations now extending into 2017.  In this economic environment the central banks of the world s major economies hold sway over perceived investment opportunities.  Quantitative easing in Japan and the Eurozone has carried over into global capital markets and has increased demand for higher risk investments. 
  The initial reaction to the U.K. vote to leave the European Union has been somewhat muted, with the exception being the continued downward pressure on the Great Britain Pound ( GBP ).  As of mid-October 2016, the GBP had weakened in excess of 20 percent, year-to-date.  The new prime minister of the U.K. remains committed to carrying out the decoupling of the U.K. from the European Union.  The details of this process remain unclear, and the uncertainty has weighed on both the U.K. and European markets.  The European Central Bank has continued to pursue a policy of quantitative easing (QE). 
  In the United States, real GDP growth accelerated in the third quarter of 2016 to a 2.9% annual rate.  This is a marked improvement over the second quarter growth rate of 1.4%.  The strong third quarter number is tempered by the fact that a large portion of gross domestic product growth was seen in increased inventories, not through consumer demand.  Consumer confidence is currently at a 3 year low.  Corporate earnings are also an area of concern, as third quarter reported earnings growth showed a clear sign of slowing.  Federal Reserve Board communications have been signaling the increased likelihood of some firming of monetary policy.  Many economists expect an increase in rates to occur in early December.  The US government bond yield curve has seen a steady increase in yields and is currently no longer sitting at near record lows.

  PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED) 
  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Europe and Japan continue to engage in unconventional monetary policy.  Asset purchases and stimulus programs in both regions have driven interest rates and investment yields to new lows.  Both regions now have historically low interest rates, with some government and corporate bonds trading with negative yields.  While the intent of these policies is to spur economic growth, the size of these programs is unprecedented, and the ultimate impact on those economies and the broader global financial system remains unclear.  
  The U.S. commercial real estate market continues to benefit from inflows of foreign capital, albeit at a slowing rate.  With the backdrop of global political conflict, and weaker international economic conditions, the U.S. dollar has remained a safe haven currency.  Lenders, however, have continued to cool to the market.  For balance sheet lenders, such as banks and insurance companies, underwriting standards for commercial real estate have been tightened.  This has resulted in lower loan-to-value and higher debt coverage ratios.  CMBS originations also have been limited as lenders are trying to adjust to the new securitization rules which require issuers to maintain an ongoing equity stake in pooled transactions.  These trends have led to increased uncertainty in the level and cost of debt for commercial properties, and in turn has injected some volatility into commercial real estate markets.  
  Impact on Our Real Estate Investments 
  The volatility in the global financial markets continues to cause a level of uncertainty in our outlook for the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets.  Both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive.  While there has been an increase in the amount of capital flowing into U.S. real estate markets, the uncertainty regarding the economic environment has made businesses reluctant to make long-term commitments, as is evidenced by the lower level of business investment and capital expenditures.  Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows.  Historically low interest rates could help offset some of the impact of these potential decreases in operating cash flow for properties financed with variable rate mortgages; however, interest rates likely will not remain at these historically low levels for the remaining life of many of our investments. In fact, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2015, and has left the door open for another increase at the end of 2016.  Currently we expect further increases in interest rates, but are uncertain as to the timing and levels.  Interest rates have become more volatile as the global capital markets react to increasing economic and geopolitical risks. 
  Impact on Our Real Estate-Related Investments 
  All of our real estate-related investments are directly or indirectly secured by commercial real estate.  As a result, our real estate-related investments, in general, have been and likely will continue to be impacted by the same factors impacting our real estate properties.  The higher yields and the improving credit position of many U.S. tenants and borrowers have attracted global capital.  However, the real estate and capital markets are fluid, and the positive trends can reverse quickly.  Economic conditions remain relatively volatile and can have a negative impact on the performance of collateral securing our loan investments, and therefore may impact the ability of some of the borrowers under our loans to make contractual interest payments to us. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had fixed rate real estate-related loan investments with a total book value (excluding asset-specific loan loss reserves) of $27.7 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan, which has a book value of zero after asset specific loan loss reserves, and the 4929 Wilshire B-Note, which has a book value of $3.6 million, were scheduled to mature within one year from   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had recorded   $5.1 million   of reserves for loan losses related to the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan.    
  Impact on Our Financing Activities 
  In light of the risks associated with potentially volatile operating cash flows from some of our real estate properties, and the possible increase in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates, we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness.  Financial market conditions have improved from the bottom of the economic cycle, and short-term interest rates in the U.S. have increased.  Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of our investments. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a $62.2 million fixed rate note payable and $116.4 million outstanding on a variable rate note payable.  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we paid off the entire outstanding principal balance due and all other sums due under our fixed rate note payable.  After taking into account the repayment of the fixed rate note payable of $62.2 million, we have $116.4 million of debt maturing (including principal amortization payments) during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017.  We plan to exercise our extension options available or pay down or refinance the variable rate note payable prior to its maturity date.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal demands for funds during the short- and long-term are and will be for: the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses, including expenses in connection with the Plan of Liquidation if approved by our stockholders; refinancing upcoming maturities and paying down debt obligations; special redemptions of common stock pursuant to our share redemption program; and the payment of distributions to stockholders. 
  We intend to use our cash on hand, proceeds from asset sales and principal repayments on our real estate loans receivable as our primary sources of immediate and long-term liquidity.  To the extent available, we also intend to use cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments and funds available under our credit facility.  However, we have suffered declines in cash flows from these sources.  
  As described above under    Overview   Plan of Liquidation,  our board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation. If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities, provide for unknown liabilities and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders.   There can be no assurances regarding the amounts of any liquidating distributions or the timing thereof. 
  Our share redemption program provides only for special redemptions.  Such redemptions are subject to an annual dollar limitation.  On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation for redemptions of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2016 (subject to review and adjustment during the year by our board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program document.  Based on historical redemption activity, we believe the $10.0 million redemption limitation for the calendar year 2016 will be sufficient for these special redemptions.  During each calendar year, the annual dollar limitation for our share redemption program will be reviewed and adjusted from time to time, if necessary.  We currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future. 
  On March 11, 2016, our board of directors declared a distribution in the amount of $0.025 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 21, 2016.  We paid this distribution on March 28, 2016.  On May 6, 2016, our board of directors declared a distribution in the amount of $0.025 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 22, 2016.  We paid this distribution on June 28, 2016. On August 9, 2016, our board of directors declared a distribution in the amount of $0.025 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 22, 2016.  We paid this distribution on September 29, 2016.  We funded these distributions with cash flow from operations from the current period and prior period cash flow from operations in excess of distributions paid.  If our stockholders approve the Plan of Liquidation, we intend to cease paying regular quarterly distributions after the payment of the 2016 fourth quarter distribution. Thereafter, we do not expect to pay regular quarterly distributions.  We intend to maintain adequate cash reserves for liquidity, capital expenditures, debt repayments, future share redemptions and other future capital needs. 
  Our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses.  Cash flow from operations from our real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectibility of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our real estate held for investment was   88%   occupied. 
  Our real estate-related investments generate cash flow in the form of interest income, which is reduced by the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses.  Cash flow from operations from our real estate-related investments is primarily dependent on the operating performance of the underlying collateral and the borrowers  ability to make debt service payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrower under the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan was delinquent.  On May 13, 2016, we received a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due to us under our investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination and received title to the collateral that secured the loan. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan, which has a book value of zero after asset specific loan loss reserves, and the 4929 Wilshire B-Note, which has a book value of $3.6 million, were scheduled to mature within one year from   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had recorded   $5.1 million   of reserves for loan losses related to the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan. 
  As a result of the factors described above, we may experience declines in future cash flow from our real estate and real estate-related investments and we expect an increased need for capital to cover leasing costs and capital improvements needed to improve the performance of our real estate assets.

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we met our cash needs for leasing costs, capital expenditures and the payment of debt obligations with cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales.  We met our operating cash needs during the same period through cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments.  We believe that potential proceeds from the sale of real estate, cash flow from operations, potential proceeds from the sale or payoff of real estate loans receivable and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the remainder of 2016.  
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned or, with respect to a limited number of properties, held a leasehold interest in   186   real estate properties (of which   12   properties were held for sale, all of which were GKK Properties).  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   three   real estate loans receivable and a participation interest with respect to a real estate joint venture. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $6.9 million  , compared to   $26.2 million   of net cash provided by operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Net cash from operations decreased in 2016 primarily due to asset sales and the timing of payments of prepaid expenditures offset by a decrease in interest paid as a result of debt refinancing and restructuring and debt payoffs, which resulted in an overall decrease in effective interest rates and a decrease in principal outstanding. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities will decrease due to anticipated asset sales.  
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $451.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The significant sources and uses of net cash provided by investing activities were as follows: 
             
    $472.8 million of cash provided from the sale of real estate;  
                
    $24.0 million of cash used for improvements to real estate;  
                
    $1.0 million of insurance proceeds received for property damage; and 
                
    a $1.5 million decrease in restricted cash for capital expenditures. 
     Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $285.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The significant sources and uses of cash for financing activities were as follows: 
             
    $184.8 million of cash used to purchase treasury securities in connection with the defeasance of notes payable; 
                
    $85.2 million of principal payments on notes payable;  
                
    $6.5 million of cash used for prepayment premium on the repayment of debt; 
                
    $9.8 million decrease in restricted cash for debt service obligations; 
                
    $13.9 million of cash used for distributions; and 
                
    $4.7 million of cash used for redemptions of common stock.  
     In addition to using our capital resources to meet our debt service obligations, for leasing costs, for capital expenditures, for operating costs, to fund special redemptions pursuant to our share redemption program and to pay distributions to our stockholders, we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor.  We also reimburse our advisor and dealer manager for certain costs they incur on our behalf.  We pay our advisor fees in connection with the management and disposition of our assets. 
  Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee.  With respect to investments in real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property.  This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition fees and expenses related thereto. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee is determined based on our proportionate share of the underlying investment.

With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75% of the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination fees and expenses related thereto) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation.  
  With respect to an investment that has suffered an impairment in value, reduction in cash flow or other negative circumstances, such investment may either be excluded from the calculation of the asset management fee described above or included in such calculation at a reduced value that is recommended by our advisor and our management and then approved by a majority of our independent directors, and this change in the fee shall be applicable to an investment upon the earlier to occur of the date on which (i) such investment is sold, (ii) such investment is surrendered to a person other than the company, our direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary or a joint venture or partnership in which we have an interest, (iii) our advisor determines that it will no longer pursue collection or other remedies related to such investment, or (iv) our advisor recommends a revised fee arrangement with respect to such investment.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we excluded our interest in an unconsolidated joint venture from the calculation of asset management fees.  Through March 31, 2016, we calculated the asset management fee for the GKK Properties based on the original cost of our investment in the GKK Mezzanine Loan, rather than on the gross value of the GKK Properties we own or in which we hold a leasehold interest.  Beginning in April 2016, the gross value of the GKK Properties fell below the original cost of our investment in the GKK Mezzanine Loan and for the period from April 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016  , we calculated the asset management fee for these properties based on the gross value of the GKK Properties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had not determined to calculate the asset management fee at an adjusted value for any other investments or to exclude any other investments from the calculation of the asset management fee. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $219.6 million   of cash and cash equivalents.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately   21%   of the cost (before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves) and   24%   of the book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets.  We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of that limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for exceeding the total liabilities limitation.  
   
  Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    Amounts include principal payments under notes payable based on maturity dates of debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  .    On October 6, 2016,  we repaid the entire outstanding principal balance due of $62.2 million and all other sums due under the Plaza in Clayton Mortgage Loan.  
   (2)    Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates and weighted-average interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  .  We incurred interest expense of $9.5 million, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of debt discount and premium totaling $0.5 million, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
   (3)    Amounts relate to future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable building and ground leases.

Debt Covenants  
  The documents evidencing our outstanding debt obligations typically require that specified loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios be maintained with respect to the financed properties.  A breach of the financial covenants in these documents may result in the lender imposing additional restrictions on our operations, such as restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, or may allow the lender to impose  cash traps  with respect to cash flow from the property securing the loan.  In addition, such a breach may constitute an event of default and the lender could require us to repay the debt immediately.  If we fail to make such repayment in a timely manner, the lender may be entitled to take possession of any property securing the loan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these debt covenants. 
  Asset Management Services Agreement Related to the GKK Properties 
  On December 19, 2013, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary ( KBS Acquisition Sub ), entered into an amended and restated asset management services agreement (the  Amended Services Agreement ) with the Property Manager with respect to the GKK Properties. The effective date of the Amended Services Agreement was December 1, 2013. Pursuant to the Amended Services Agreement, the Property Manager agreed to provide, among other services: standard asset management services, assistance related to dispositions, accounting services and budgeting and business plans for the GKK Properties (the  Services ). The Property Manager is not affiliated with us or KBS Acquisition Sub. As compensation for the Services, we agreed to pay the Property Manager: (i) an annual fee of $7.5 million plus all GKK Property-related expenses incurred by the Property Manager, (ii) subject to certain terms and conditions in the Amended Services Agreement, a profit participation interest based on a percentage (ranging from 10% to 30%) of the amount by which the gross fair market value or gross sales price of certain identified portfolios of GKK Properties exceeds the sum of (a) an agreed-upon baseline value for such GKK Property portfolios plus (b) new capital expended to increase the value of GKK Properties within the portfolios and expenditures made to pay for tenant improvements and leasing commissions related to these GKK Properties as of the measurement date, and (iii) a monthly construction oversight fee equal to a percentage of construction costs for certain construction projects at the GKK Properties overseen by the Property Manager.  
  On June 29, 2016, KBS Acquisition Sub entered into two agreements, a second amended and restated asset management services agreement (the  Second Amended Services Agreement ) and an accounting/construction services agreement (the  Accounting/Construction Services Agreement ), with the Property Manager.  The effective date of both the Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement was June 1, 2016.  Combined, the Services and the key terms and compensation for the Services under the Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement are the same as those of the prior Amended Services Agreement; the two agreements allocate the Services and the compensation between asset management services and accounting/construction services.  The Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement supersede and replace all prior agreements related to the Services among us and our affiliates and the Property Manager and its affiliates.  The Second Amended Services Agreement and the Accounting/Construction Services Agreement will terminate on December 31, 2016, with a   one  -year extension option at our option, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the agreements.  On June 29, 2016,  the Property Manager assigned the Second Amended Services Agreement to an affiliate, GPT Realty Management LP, an entity controlled by Gramercy. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we accrued   $19.1 million   of estimated profit participation interest related to the GKK Properties under the Second Amended Services Agreement. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  As of   September 30, 2015  , we owned or, with respect to a limited number of properties, held a leasehold interest in, 391 real estate properties, four real estate loans receivable (two of which were impaired) and a participation interest with respect to a real estate joint venture.  Subsequent to   September 30, 2015  , we sold three historical real estate properties and 203 GKK Properties and received title to a retail property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due under our investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination.  As a result, as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned or, with respect to a limited number of properties, held a leasehold interest in,   186   real estate properties (of which   12   properties were held for sale, all of which were GKK Properties), three real estate loans receivable (one of which was impaired) and a participation interest with respect to a real estate joint venture.

In accordance with ASU No. 2014-08,   Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity   ( ASU No. 2014-08 ), operating results of properties that are classified as held for sale in the ordinary course of business on or subsequent to January 1, 2014 would generally be included in continuing operations on our consolidated statements of operations.  Operating results of properties that were classified as held for sale in financial statements issued for the reporting periods prior to reporting periods beginning January 1, 2014 will remain in discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of operations.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   two   historical real estate properties and   177   GKK Properties, which properties were not classified as held for sale in financial statements issued for the reporting periods prior to January 1, 2014.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had classified   12   properties as held for sale, all of which were GKK Properties.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold three historical real estate properties and 30 GKK Properties, which properties were not classified as held for sale in financial statements issued for the reporting periods prior to January 1, 2014.  In accordance with ASU No. 2014-08, the operations of these properties are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statements of operations.   
  Our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not indicative of those expected in future periods due to asset sales and anticipated asset sales. If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we will undertake an orderly liquidation by selling all of our assets, paying our known liabilities, providing for unknown liabilities and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders.   There can be no assurances regarding the amounts of any liquidating distributions or the timing thereof.  In general, we expect that our revenues and expenses related to our portfolio will decrease in future periods due to anticipated disposition activity.   
  Comparison of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollar amounts in thousands):   

  _____________________ 
   (1)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to real estate and real estate-related investments disposed of on or after July 1, 2015.   
   (2)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us throughout both periods presented.

Rental income from our real estate properties decreased by   $9.9 million   primarily due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in rental income due to an increase in occupancy at certain properties and our receipt of title to a retail property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due under our investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination.  Overall, we expect rental income to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales.  Our rental income in future periods will also vary based on the occupancy rates and rental rates of the properties in our portfolio.   
  Tenant reimbursements from our real estate properties decreased by   $7.5 million   primarily due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, and a net decrease in other recoveries related to the GKK Properties held throughout both periods.  Our tenant reimbursements in future periods will vary based on several factors, including the occupancy rates of the properties in our portfolio, changes in base year terms, and changes in reimbursable operating expenses.  Generally, as new leases are negotiated, the base year resets to operating expenses incurred in the year the lease is signed and the tenant generally only reimburses operating expenses to the extent and by the amount that its allocable share of the building s operating expenses in future years increases from its base year.  As a result, as new leases are executed, tenant reimbursements would generally decrease.  Rental income may or may not change by amounts corresponding to changes in tenant reimbursements due to new leases.  Overall, we expect tenant reimbursements to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales. 
  Interest income from real estate loans receivable decreased by   $0.1 million  .  In general, we expect interest income in future periods to remain fairly constant, but to decrease to the extent that we receive principal repayments on or make dispositions of real estate loans receivable.  On September 1, 2015, the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination matured without repayment.  Subsequently, we received interest payments from the borrower under the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination and recognized the interest income on a cash basis.  On May 13, 2016, we received a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due to us under our investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination and received title to the collateral that secured the loan.  Interest income from real estate loans receivable in future periods may also be affected by potential loan impairments as a result of current or future market conditions.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrower under the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan was delinquent.   
  If any of the borrowers under our real estate loans receivable are unable to repay their loans at maturity or default on their loan, the impact to future interest income and loan recoveries may be significant and will depend on several factors unique to each individual loan.  In general, if we own a mezzanine loan or a B-Note and the borrower is unable to repay its loan at maturity, we may have more restrictions and fewer options regarding the resolution of our investment than if we had a first priority lien.  In certain circumstances, the senior lenders, in conjunction with us, may be willing to grant the borrower extensions or may grant extensions in exchange for more favorable terms (such as higher interest rates, a partial payoff, or the entitlement to a portion of a junior lender s interest income, etc.).  If the senior lenders will not grant the borrower an extension, we, as the mezzanine lender, may foreclose on the ownership interests of the borrower and indirectly take legal title to the property subject to the existing senior loans or we may negotiate a discounted repayment.  We could attempt to negotiate an extension or modification with the senior lenders as the new borrower; however, if the senior lenders were not willing to extend or modify the loans and we were not able to repay the senior loans, we would most likely relinquish our interests or rights in the investment to the holders of the senior loans.  Actual outcomes may differ significantly from the above based on factors specific to individual loans and situations. 
  Property operating, maintenance and management costs from our real estate properties decreased by   $6.2 million   primarily related to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, and a decrease in utility costs related to properties held throughout both periods.  Overall, we expect property operating, maintenance and management costs to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales. 
  Real estate taxes, property-related taxes and insurance from our real estate properties decreased from   $5.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $3.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes and property-related taxes related to properties held throughout both periods.  Overall, we expect real estate taxes, property-related taxes and insurance to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales.

Asset management fees decreased from   $2.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $1.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, and a decrease in asset management fees for the GKK Properties.  Beginning in April 2016, the gross value of the GKK Properties fell below the original cost of our investment in the GKK Mezzanine Loan and for the period from April 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, we calculated the asset management fee related to the GKK Properties based on the gross value of the GKK Properties.  See the discussion of asset management fees under     Liquidity and Capital Resources  above.  Overall, we expect asset management fees to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales or payoffs.  
  General and administrative expenses increased by   $0.2 million  .  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of management fees related to the Second Amended Services Agreement, legal fees, audit fees, transfer agent fees, state and local income taxes and other professional fees. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense from our real estate properties decreased by   $6.4 million   primarily due to real estate property sales.  Upon classifying a property as held for sale, we cease depreciation and amortization expense for that property.  Overall, we expect depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales. 
  Interest expense from the financing of our portfolio decreased by   $4.9 million  , primarily due to a decrease in the average loan balance as a result of principal repayments and debt extinguishments subsequent to September 30, 2015.  Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Interest expense in future periods will vary based on fluctuations in one-month LIBOR, our level of future borrowings and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at similar rates.  We do not currently plan to acquire or originate more real estate or real estate-related assets and, therefore, do not plan to enter into any purchase financing in the future.  However, we may need to refinance our existing indebtedness in the future.  Overall, we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales and principal paydowns. 
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $4.1 million  , of which $3.7 million relates to 15 GKK Properties classified as real estate held for investment, to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated fair values and $0.4 million with respect to three GKK Properties that were held for sale to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated sales price less estimated costs to sell.  The facts and circumstances leading to the impairments on our real estate held for investment during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 
             
    Citizens Bank Portfolio:    We recognized an impairment charge during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $1.5 million relating to two properties in the Citizens Bank Portfolio due to a decrease in cash flow projections primarily due to an increase in projected vacancy, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate.  
                
    Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Portfolio:    We recognized an impairment charge during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $1.3 million relating to seven properties in the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Portfolio due to a decrease in cash flow projections primarily due to an increase in projected vacancy, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate. 
                
    Other Properties:    We     recognized an impairment charge during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $0.9 million relating to six other GKK Properties classified as held for investment.  No impairment charge related to any individual property was greater than $800,000.  These impairments generally resulted from changes in lease projections, including longer estimated lease-up periods and lower projected rental rates, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate.

During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $34.9 million   with respect to 12 properties (including nine GKK Properties) to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated fair values.  The facts and circumstances leading to the impairments on our real estate during the three months ended September 30, 2015 were as follows: 
             
    Woodfield Preserve Office Center:    We recognized an impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $18.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in Woodfield Preserve Office Center, an office property located in Schaumburg, Illinois, due to a decrease in projected cash flow projections.  Chicago s northwest suburb office rental market was heavily affected by the 2008-2009 recession; however, the outlook was optimistic that the market would recover to levels seen prior to the recession.  Although the general market has seen positive net absorption, rental rates have remained low while lease concessions remain high resulting in lower projected revenue growth and cash flow projections.  The market conditions in Schaumburg, Illinois have also resulted in a lack of interest from investors. 
                
    Tysons Dulles Plaza:    We recognized an impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $15.7 million to reduce the carrying value of Tysons Dulles Plaza, an office property located in McLean, Virginia, to its estimated fair value.  We revised its cash flow projections primarily for longer estimated lease up periods as a result of the continued lack of demand in the McLean office rental market.  While the market has seen slight increases in rental rates, lease concessions have not declined as previously expected.  We also revised its cash flow projections to account for higher projected capital costs for tenant improvements, general building upgrades, and deferred maintenance costs needed to position the property competitively with other properties in the area, to address certain maintenance issues and to attract additional tenants.  The lack of sales activity in McLean, Virginia has also resulted in higher capitalization rates.   
                
    Other Properties:    We recognized impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $1.1 million related to ten other properties, including nine GKK Properties.  No impairment charge related to any individual property was greater than $250,000.  These impairments generally resulted from changes in the projected hold periods or changes in leasing projections including longer estimated lease-up periods and lower projected rental rates, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate. 
     We recorded a provision for loan loss reserves of   $2.5 million   related to the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan and the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not record provision for loan loss reserves. 
  We recognized a gain on sales of real estate of   $7.9 million   related to the disposition of one historical real estate property and 45 GKK Properties during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   that were included in income from continuing operations.  We recognized a gain on sales of real estate of   $0.8 million   related to the disposition of one GKK Property during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   that was included in income from continuing operations.  
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $7.0 million   related to the early pay-off of the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Mortgage Loan.  On September 1, 2016, we repaid the entire $36.2 million principal balance and all other sums due on the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Mortgage Loan and paid a prepayment premium of $6.5 million.  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $2.2 million   related to the early pay-off of the Pitney Bowes - Wachovia A Mortgage Loan.  On September 16, 2015, we repaid the entire $14.0 million principal balance and all other sums due on the Pitney Bowes - Wachovia A Mortgage Loan and paid a prepayment premium of $2.2 million.

   (2)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us throughout both periods presented.  
  Rental income from our real estate properties decreased by   $23.3 million   primarily due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in rental income due to an increase in occupancy at certain properties and our receipt of title to a retail property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due under our investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination.  Overall, we expect rental income to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales.  Our rental income in future periods will also vary based on the occupancy rates and rental rates of the properties in our portfolio.   
  Tenant reimbursements from our real estate properties decreased by   $12.3 million   primarily due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations.  Our tenant reimbursements in future periods will vary based on several factors discussed above under     Comparison of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Interest income from real estate loans receivable remained constant at approximately $2.2 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  In general, we expect interest income in future periods to remain fairly constant, but to decrease to the extent that we receive principal repayments on or make dispositions of real estate loans receivable.  On September 1, 2015, the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination matured without repayment.  Subsequently, we received interest payments from the borrower under the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination and recognized the interest income on a cash basis.  On May 13, 2016, we received a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due to us under our investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination and received title to the collateral that secured the loan. Interest income from real estate loans receivable in future periods may also be affected by potential loan impairments as a result of current or future market conditions.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrower under the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan was delinquent.    
  Please see     Comparison of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015    above for a discussion of the impact of potential loan impairments on interest income and a discussion of the impact to us if any of the borrowers under our real estate loans receivable are unable to repay their loans at maturity or default on their loan. 
  Property operating, maintenance and management costs from our real estate properties decreased by   $15.5 million   primarily related to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, and a decrease in snow removal expenses related to our real estate properties located in the midwestern and northeastern regions of the United States due to record snow fall during the first quarter 2015.  Overall, we expect property operating, maintenance and management costs to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales. 
  Real estate taxes, property-related taxes and insurance from our real estate properties decreased from   $18.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $13.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes and property-related taxes related to properties held throughout both periods.  Overall, we expect real estate taxes, property-related taxes and insurance to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales.  
  Asset management fees decreased from   $7.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $6.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to properties sold, the results of which are included in income from continuing operations, and a decrease in asset management fees for the GKK Properties.  Beginning in April 2016, the gross value of the GKK Properties fell below the original cost of our investment in the GKK Mezzanine Loan and for the period from April 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, we calculated the asset management fee related to the GKK Properties based on the gross value of the GKK Properties.  See the discussion of asset management fees under    Liquidity and Capital Resources  above.  Overall, we expect asset management fees to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales or payoffs.  
  Foreclosure fees and expenses were $0.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and related to our receipt of title to a retail property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of all amounts due under our investment in the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination.  We did not incur any foreclosure fees and expenses during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  We do not expect to incur significant amounts of foreclosure fees and expenses in future periods as we do not currently anticipate foreclosing on more real estate or real estate-related assets. 
  General and administrative expenses decreased by   $1.9 million   primarily due to a decrease of $2.6 million in the estimated profit participation interest related to the GKK Properties under the Second Amended Services Agreement, partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million of other professional fees related to the engagement of Evercore Group L.L.C. by the special committee of our board of directors to act as our financial advisor.  See    Contractual Commitments and Contingencies   Asset Management Services Agreement Related to the GKK Properties  for more information.  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of management fees related to the Second Amended Services Agreement, legal fees, audit fees, transfer agent fees, state and local income taxes and other professional fees. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense from our real estate properties decreased by   $15.1 million   primarily due to real estate property sales.  Upon classifying a property as held for sale, we cease depreciation and amortization expense for that property.  Overall, we expect depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in future periods due to anticipated real estate property sales.

Interest expense from the financing of our portfolio decreased by   $13.9 million  , primarily due to a decrease in the average loan balance as a result of principal repayments and debt extinguishments subsequent to September 30, 2015.  Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of   $0.3 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Interest expense in future periods will vary based on fluctuations in one-month LIBOR, our level of future borrowings and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at similar rates.  We do not currently plan to acquire or originate more real estate or real estate-related assets and, therefore, do not plan to enter into any purchase financing in the future.  However, we may need to refinance our existing indebtedness in the future.  Overall, we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales and principal paydowns. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $29.6 million  , of which $25.4 million related to 47 properties (including 44 GKK Properties) classified as real estate held for investment, to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated fair values and $4.2 million with respect to 13 GKK Properties that were held for sale or sold to write-down the carrying values of these real estate investments to their estimated sales price less estimated costs to sell.  The facts and circumstances leading to the impairments on our real estate held for investment during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 
             
    City Gate Plaza:    We recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $3.3 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in City Gate Plaza, an office property located in Sacramento, California, to its estimated fair value.  We revised our cash flow projections to account for higher projected leasing costs to stabilize the property.  The continued lack of demand in the Sacramento office rental market also resulted in higher capitalization rates.  
                
    University Park Buildings:    We recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $3.2 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in the University Park Buildings, an office property located in Sacramento, California, to its estimated fair value.  We revised our cash flow projections primarily to account for higher projected capital costs for general building upgrades and to address certain maintenance issues.  The continued lack of demand in the Sacramento office rental market also resulted in higher capitalization rates.  
                
    ADP Plaza:    We recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $1.7 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in ADP Plaza, an office property located in Portland, Oregon, to its estimated fair value.  We revised our cash flow projections due to an increase in projected vacancy as a tenant occupying 48.6% of the building s rentable square feet notified us that it will exercise its contraction option as early as January 2017, resulting in a decrease in projected cash flows.   
                
    GKK Properties:   
                
    Citizens Bank Portfolio:    We recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $10.8 million relating to 20 properties in the Citizens Bank Portfolio due to a decrease in cash flow projections primarily due to an increase in projected vacancy, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate.  
                
    Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Portfolio:    We recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $3.0 million relating to 13 properties in the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Portfolio due to a decrease in cash flow projections primarily due to an increase in projected vacancy, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate. 
                
    Other Properties:    We     recognized an impairment charge during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $3.4 million relating to 11 other GKK Properties classified as held for investment.  No impairment charge related to any individual property was greater than $800,000.  These impairments generally resulted from changes in lease projections, including longer estimated lease-up periods and lower projected rental rates, thus decreasing the projected cash flows the properties would generate.

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $34.9 million   with respect to 12 properties (including nine GKK Properties) to write-down the carrying values of certain of our real estate investments to their estimated fair values.  Please see    Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three months ended September 30, 2015  above for a discussion of the impairment charges recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
  We recorded a provision for loan loss reserves of   $2.5 million   related to the Sandmar Mezzanine Loan and the Lawrence Village Plaza Loan Origination during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not record provision for loan loss reserves. 
  We recognized a gain on sales of real estate of   $128.8 million   related to the disposition of two historical real estate properties and 177 GKK Properties during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that were included in income from continuing operations.  We recognized a gain on sales of real estate of   $49.9 million   related to the disposition of two historical industrial properties and four GKK Properties during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   that were included in income from continuing operations.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $26.3 million   related to the following:  
             
    Defeasance of the FSI 6000 Mortgage Loan:    In connection with the disposition of the FSI 6000 Properties on April 11, 2016, we entered into a defeasance agreement with each of the lenders under the FSI 6000 Mortgage Loans to defease the entire aggregate outstanding principal balance of $102.3 million under the FSI 6000 Mortgage Loans, releasing the FSI 6000 Properties, which had secured the FSI 6000 Mortgage Loans.  The defeasance costs and write-off of an unamortized discount resulted in an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.6 million. 
                
    Defeasance of the Bank of America - BBD2 Mortgage Loan:    On April 15, 2016, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a defeasance agreement with the lender under the Bank of America - BBD2 Mortgage Loan to defease the remaining outstanding principal balance of $65.1 million, releasing all the properties that secured the Bank of America - BBD2 Mortgage Loan.  The defeasance costs and write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $12.7 million. 
                
    Early pay-off of the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Mortgage Loan:    On September 1, 2016, we repaid the entire $36.2 million principal balance and all other sums due on the Pitney Bowes - Bank of America Mortgage Loan and paid a prepayment premium of $6.5 million.  The prepayment premium and write-off of an unamortized discount resulted in an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $7.0 million. 
     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $8.6 million   related to the early pay-off of the Pitney Bowes - Wachovia A Mortgage Loan and the 101 Independence Mortgage Loan.  On September 16, 2015, we repaid the entire $14.0 million principal balance and all other sums due on the Pitney Bowes - Wachovia A Mortgage Loan and a prepayment premium of $2.2 million.  On May 1, 2015, in connection with the disposition of 101 Independence, we repaid the entire $65.3 million principal balance and all other sums due on the 101 Independence Mortgage Loan, including a prepayment premium of $4.4 million, and we wrote-off an unamortized discount on note payable of $2.0 million.

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  We believe that funds from operations ( FFO ) is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) definition.  FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  In connection with NAREIT s Accounting and Financial Standards Hot Topics, we are excluding impairment charges on real estate assets from our calculation of FFO.  We have also restated FFO from prior periods to exclude these impairment charges.  NAREIT believes that impairment charges on real estate assets are often early recognition of losses on prospective sales of properties, and therefore, the exclusion of these impairments is consistent with the exclusion of gains and losses recognized from the sales of real estate.  Although these losses are included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded these impairment charges in our calculation of FFO because impairments do not impact the current operating performance of our investments, and may or may not provide an indication of future operating performance.  We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs.  However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.  Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. 
  Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO.  As a result, our management also uses modified funds from operations ( MFFO ) as an indicator of our ongoing performance.  MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses; adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above and below market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges.  We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the Investment Program Association ( IPA ) in November 2010 as interpreted by management.  Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do.   
  We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes non-operating items included in FFO.  MFFO also excludes non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue.  Additionally, we believe that MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance.  MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs, which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies.  MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. 
  FFO and MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP.  Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO and MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above.  Accordingly, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance.  In addition, FFO and MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity.  We believe FFO and MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures.  During periods of significant disposition activity, FFO and MFFO are much more limited as measures of future performance.

  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of straight-line rent, amortization of above- and below-market leases, loss from extinguishment of debt, impairment charges on real estate loans receivable and the net amortization of discounts and premiums on mortgage loans related to the GKK Properties are the most significant adjustments to us at the present time.  We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations: 
             
    Adjustments for straight-line rent  .  These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period; 
                
    Amortization of above- and below-market leases.    Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue.  Since market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the operating performance of the real estate; 
                
    Loss from extinguishment of debt  .  A loss from extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the carrying value of any consideration transferred to the lender in return for the extinguishment of a debt and the net carrying value of the debt at the time of settlement.  We have excluded the loss from extinguishment of debt in our calculation of MFFO because these losses do not impact the current operating performance of our investments and do not provide an indication of future operating performance;  
                
    Impairment charges on real estate loans receivable  .  An impairment charge on a real estate loan receivable represents a write-down of the carrying value of a real estate loan to reflect the current valuation of the asset, whether or not the asset is intended to be held long-term.  Although these losses are included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded these impairment charges in our calculation of MFFO because impairments do not impact the current operating performance of our investments, and may or may not provide an indication of future operating performance.  We believe it is useful to investors to have a supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance directly and therefore excludes such adjustments as impairment charges on real estate loans receivable;  and 
                
    Net amortization of discounts and premiums on mortgage loans related to the GKK Properties.    Discounts and premiums on debt are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest expense.  This application results in interest expense recognition that is different than the underlying contractual terms of the debt.  We have excluded the amortization of discounts and premiums related to the debt assumed in connection with the Settlement Agreement in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our debt as the amortization of discounts and premiums has no ongoing economic impact on our operations.  The debt assumed related to the GKK Properties was marked to market as of the date we entered into Settlement Agreement, which resulted in discounts and premiums related to the debt assumed.  We believe excluding these items provides investors with a useful supplemental metric that directly addresses core operating performance.

Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the table below for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands).  No conclusions or comparisons should be made from the presentation of these periods.     

FFO and MFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs.

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid aggregate cash distributions of $13.9 million.  FFO and cash flow from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $(8.0) million   and   $6.9 million  , respectively.  We funded our total distributions paid with current period cash flow from operations and prior period cash flow from operations in excess of distributions paid.  For purposes of determining the source of our distributions paid, we assume first that we use cash flow from operations from the relevant periods to fund distribution payments.  See the reconciliation of FFO to net income above.  For information on our liquidity and distribution policies, see    Liquidity and Capital Resources.   If our stockholders approve the Plan of Liquidation, we intend to cease paying regular quarterly distributions after the payment of the 2016 fourth quarter distribution.  Thereafter, we do not expect to pay regular quarterly distributions. 
  Our operating performance cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including those discussed under  Forward-Looking Statements,     Market Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets,   Liquidity and Capital Resources and  Results of Operations  herein and the risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in the Proxy Statement, each as filed with the SEC.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our consolidated interim financial statements and condensed notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements.  Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.  A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.  There have been no significant changes to our policies during 2016.  
   
  Subsequent Events 
  We evaluate subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. 
  Distribution Declared 
  On November 7, 2016, our board of directors declared a distribution in the amount of   $0.025   per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 22, 2016.  We expect to pay this distribution on or about December 29, 2016. 
  Renewal of Advisory Agreement 
  On November 8, 2016, we renewed the advisory agreement with the advisor. The renewed advisory agreement is effective through November 8, 2017; however, either party may terminate the renewed advisory agreement without cause or penalty upon providing 60 days  written notice. The terms of the renewed advisory agreement are identical to those of the advisory agreement that was previously in effect, including the August 9, 2016 amendment to the previous advisory agreement.

  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to (i) maintain liquidity and (ii) fund the financing and refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio.  We are also exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of our investments in mortgage, mezzanine and other real estate loans receivable.  Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes.  Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.  
  We have borrowed funds and made investments at a combination of fixed and variable rates.  Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt or fixed rate real estate loans receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated.  However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value and book value of our fixed rate real estate loans receivable were   $21.2 million   and   $22.6 million  , respectively.  The fair value estimate of our real estate loans receivable is calculated using an internal valuation model that considers the expected cash flows for the loans, underlying collateral values (for collateral-dependent loans) and the estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed rate debt was $62.2 million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was $62.2 million.  On October 6, 2016, we repaid the entire $62.2 million outstanding principal balance due and all other sums due under our fixed rate loan. The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated as of   September 30, 2016  .  With respect to our fixed rate instruments, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting changes in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our ongoing operations.  
  Conversely, movements in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but would not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments.  However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of variable rate instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our   $116.4 million   of variable rate debt outstanding.      Based on interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , if interest rates are 100 basis points higher during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt outstanding would increase by approximately $1.2 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , one-month LIBOR was 0.53111% and if this index was reduced to 0% during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease by $0.6 million.  
  The weighted-average annual effective interest rate of our fixed rate real estate loans receivable as of   September 30, 2016   was 11.4%.  The weighted-average annual effective interest rate represents the effective interest rate as of   September 30, 2016  , using the interest method, which we use to recognize interest income on our real estate loans receivable.  The interest rate of our fixed rate debt and interest rate of our variable rate debt as of   September 30, 2016   were 5.9% and 2.3%, respectively.

  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
           a) 
    During the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 
              b) 
    Not applicable. 
              c) 
    We have a share redemption program pursuant to which stockholders may only sell their shares to us in connection with a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  (each as defined in the share redemption program and, together with redemptions sought in connection with a stockholder s death,  special redemptions ).  Such redemptions are subject to an annual dollar limitation and are further subject to the other limitations described in our share redemption program, including: 
                
    During each calendar year, special redemptions are limited to an annual dollar amount determined by our board of directors.  The annual dollar limitation for our share redemption program may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time during the year.  On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2016 (subject to review and adjustment during the year by our board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in our share redemption program. 
                
    During any calendar year, we may redeem no more than 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. 
                
    We have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. 
     We do not currently expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future. 
  If we cannot repurchase all shares presented for redemption in any month because of the limitations on redemptions set forth in our share redemption program, then we will honor redemption requests on a pro rata basis, except that if a pro rata redemption would result in a stockholder owning less than the minimum purchase requirement described in our most recently effective registration statement, as such registration statement has been amended or supplemented, then we would redeem all of such stockholder s shares.  
  Upon a transfer of shares, any pending redemption requests with respect to such transferred shares will be canceled as of the date we accept the transfer. Stockholders wishing us to continue to consider a redemption request related to any transferred shares must resubmit their redemption request. 
  The complete share redemption program document is filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and is available at the SEC s website at   http:  //www.sec.gov  . 
  The only redemptions we made under our share redemption program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were those that qualified as, and met the requirements for, special redemptions under our share redemption program.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we fulfilled all redemption requests that qualified as special redemptions under our share redemption program with a combination of cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of properties. 
  We may amend, suspend or terminate the program upon 30 days  notice to our stockholders.  We may provide this notice by including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC, or by a separate mailing to our stockholders.

  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (continued) 

On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $3.94 per share (unaudited), based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2015, with the exception of an adjustment to our net asset value to give effect to the December 7, 2015 payment of a special distribution of $0.25 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2015.  The change in redemption price became effective for the December 2015 redemption date and was effective through the September 30, 2016 redemption date. 
  On October 5, 2016, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $3.65 per share (unaudited), based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of June 30, 2016, except for certain items for which estimated values were adjusted subsequent to June 30, 2016, as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on October 7, 2016. The change in redemption price became effective for the October 2016 redemption date and will be effective until the estimated value per share is updated. For a full description of the methodologies and assumptions used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share, see our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on October 7, 2016. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed shares pursuant to our share redemption program as follows: 
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    We announced commencement of our share redemption program on April 6, 2006 and amendments to the program on August 16, 2006 (which amendment became effective on December 14, 2006), August 1, 2007 (which amendment became effective on September 13, 2007), August 14, 2008 (which amendment became effective on September 13, 2008), March 26, 2009 (which amendment became effective on April 26, 2009), May 13, 2009 (which amendment became effective on June 12, 2009), March 26, 2012 (which amendment became effective on April 25, 2012) and March 13, 2013 (which amendment became effective on April 12, 2013). 
   (2)    In accordance with our share redemption program, the redemption price for all stockholders is equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock as of the redemption date (described above).  
   (3)    We limit the dollar value of shares that may be redeemed under our share redemption program as described above.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed   $4.7 million   of shares of common stock.  The only redemptions we made under our share redemption program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were those that qualified as, and met the requirements for, special redemptions under our share redemption program.  On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation for redemptions of $10.0 million in the aggregate for calendar year 2016.  Based on this redemption limitation and those described above and redemptions through   September 30, 2016  , we may redeem up to $5.3 million of shares that meet the requirements for special redemptions for the remainder of 2016.

Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Advisor from engaging in other activities, including, without limitation, the rendering of advice to other Persons (including other REITs) and the management of other programs advised, sponsored or organized by the Advisor or its Affiliates. Nor shall this Agreement limit or restrict the right of any manager, director, officer, employee or equityholder of the Advisor or its Affiliates to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other Person. The Advisor may, with respect to any investment in which the Company is a participant, also render advice and service to each and every other participant therein. The Advisor shall promptly disclose to the Board of Directors the existence of any condition or circumstance, existing or anticipated, of which it has knowledge, that creates or could create a conflict of interest between the Advisor s obligations to the Company and its obligations to or its interest in any other Person. 
  11.02   Time Commitment  . The Advisor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents to, devote to the Company such time as shall be reasonably necessary to conduct the business and affairs of the Company in an appropriate manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

Consistent with the foregoing, it is specifically recognized that the Advisor or one or more of its Affiliates has in the past and may in the future organize, sponsor or otherwise permit to exist other investment vehicles (including vehicles for investment in real estate) and financial and service organizations having  KBS  as a part of their name, all without the need for any consent (and without the right to object thereto) by the Company.
