NOTE E - GOING CONCERN      The Company is currently in the development stage and their activities consist solely of corporate formation, raising capital, and attempting to sell products to generate revenues.     There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations and carry out its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.     The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.             FIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS             NOTE E - GOING CONCERN (Continued)      As of September 30, 2016 the cash and cash equivalent balance was $7,395 and there is cumulative loss of $297,366 for the cumulative period from May 10, 2010 (Date of Inception) to September 30, 2016.     The Company s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations.                   Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.        The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q.       Our Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.       Overview      First America Resources Corporation is a Nevada corporation formed on May 10, 2010, with registered address at 1955 Baring Blvd, Sparks, Nevada 89434. First America Resources Corporation has office at 1000 East Armstrong Street, Morris, IL 60450, and contact telephone number 815-941-9888.     The Corporation was originally known as Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc. when formed. The Corporation amended its Articles of Incorporation as follows: The Corporation changed its name from Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc. to First America Resources Corporation. The effective date of the amendment was when final approval from FINRA was received, which was August 26, 2014.     We were previously engaged in selling the lithium-ion batteries and related power supplies that mainly are used in mobile and consumer electronics products, such as readers, DVD players, digital cameras and digital video recorders, communications products, electric-power bikes and mopeds, miner's lamps, electric-power tools, electric-power sources for instruments and meters and other similar electrical equipment that can run on batteries.           On February 6, 2014, pursuant to an Agreement between Mr. Keming Li, former CEO/President and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group Inc a Nevada corporation (the "Issuer"), Ms. Guoling Jin, former Treasury and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group Inc, and Ms. Madison Li (the stockholder), of Golden Oasis New Energy Group Inc, and Mr. Jian Li (the "Purchaser"), Mr. Jian Li became the principal stockholder and Chief Executive Officer and Tzongshyan George Sheu the Vice-President, Secretary of the Company and a Director on the Board of Directors of the Company as well.     In connection with this change of control, we discontinued our current business. It is anticipated we will acquire First America Metal Corporation, a business owned primarily by Mr. Jian Li, depending upon completion of audit and preparation of required filing on Form 8-K, which we currently hope to complete in the next 12 months but may continue to take longer than such currently anticipated dates.     First America Metal Corporation in Morris, IL which is an international scrap metal company specializing in recycling of Non-Ferrous and electronic material and has become one large exporter of scrap metal in the Midwest. First America Metal Corp is operating business branch at Dallas, Texas since 11/2014 and operating the Atlanta branch since 1/14/2016. Management anticipates that after acquisition we will be competitive in pricing of some or all of the following, depending upon market conditions which can change, even rapidly, from time-to-time: Copper, Brass, Stainless, Aluminum, High Temp Alloys, Zinc, Tin, Cobalt, Tungsten Alloys, and electronic material.       Results of Operations          For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015:          Revenue       The Company had $0.00 and $ 0.00 of the lithium-ion battery sales revenue for the fiscal quarters ended at September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.       Cost of Revenue       For the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $0.00 and $0.00 Cost of Goods Sold were recorded respectively.       Expense       Our expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows:     For the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were total of $4,986 and $1,717 operating expenses.           For the cumulative periods from May 10, 2010 to September 30, 2016, there were total of $ 301,378 operating expenses. Detail is shown in the below table:            We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in future periods if and when we close our planned acquisition as described above.       Income   Operation Taxes       We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.     We paid no income taxes in USA for the fiscal quarter periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively due to the net operation loss in USA.             Net Loss       We incurred net losses of $4,986 and $1,717 for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $297,366 for the cumulative periods of May 10, 2010 to September 30, 2016.       Liquidity and Capital Resources                     Current Ratio = Current Asset / Current Liabilities      Working Capital = Current asset - Current Liabilities  Total Debt / Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity         The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $7,395 at September 30, 2016 and negative working capital of $34,455. There were total liabilities of $105,937 at September 30, 2016. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 7,831 at June 30, 2016 and negative working capital of $31,469. There were total liabilities of $101,387 at June 30, 2016.     Until we generate more operating revenues or receive other financing, all our costs, which we will incur irrespective of our business development activities, including bank service fees and those costs associated with SEC requirements associated with staying public, will be funded by Jian Li, our president and Director. Mr. Li is not obligated to pay these costs and any costs advanced will be treated as a demand loan with to be agreed interest. At September 30, 2016, the amount of $102,087 had been advanced by Mr. Li under these terms.     These costs are estimated to be less than $25,000 annually until we close our potential acquisition. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may lose the qualification for the quotation of our securities in the Over the Counter Markets, and our securities would no longer trade on such markets. Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and as a consequence we fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will now own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting.           After our potential acquisition, we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding, except for the anticipated loans from management as described above.     Our current lack of operations, revenues and cash and other financial resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk       Not applicable.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. The Company s controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) at September 30, 2016 based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
