  Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  October 31, 2016 
   
  Note 1. Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended   October 31, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   January 31, 2017  . The balance sheet at   January 31, 2016  , has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2016   ( Form 10-K ).  All references to the  Company  refer to Virco Mfg. Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
   
  Note 2. Seasonality 
  The market for educational furniture is marked by extreme seasonality, with approximately   50%   of the Company s total sales typically occurring from June to August each year, the Company s peak season. Hence, the Company typically builds and carries significant amounts of inventory during and in anticipation of this peak summer season to facilitate the rapid delivery requirements of customers in the educational market. This requires a large up-front investment in inventory, labor, storage and related costs as inventory is built in anticipation of peak sales during the summer months. As the capital required for this build-up generally exceeds cash available from operations, the Company has generally relied on third-party bank financing to meet cash flow requirements during the build-up period immediately preceding the peak season. In addition, the Company typically is faced with a large balance of accounts receivable during the peak season. This occurs for two primary reasons. First, accounts receivable balances typically increase during the peak season as shipments of products increase. Second, many customers during this period are government institutions, which tend to pay accounts receivable more slowly than commercial customers. 
  The Company s working capital requirements during and in anticipation of the peak summer season require management to make estimates and judgments that affect assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to market demand, labor costs, and stocking inventory. 
   
  Note 3. New Accounting Standards 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB amended its existing accounting standards for the presentation of debt issuance costs in the statement of financial position. The amendments generally require that the issuance costs related to a recognized debt obligation be presented as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt obligation, with the associated amortization recognized as a component of interest expense. The amendments were effective for beginning February 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis; the Company adopted the standard for issuance costs incurred related to its revolving line of credit. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of   $84,000   from prepaid expenses and other current assets to current portion of long-term debt,   $125,000   from other accrued liabilities to current portion of long-term debt and   $69,000   from other assets to long-term debt to as of January 31, 2016. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of   $84,000   from prepaid expenses and other current assets to current portion of long-term debt,   $125,000   from other accrued liabilities to current portion of long-term debt and   $90,000   from other assets to long-term debt as of October 31, 2015. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes", an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current  requirement  that  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  of  a  tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Board also decided to permit earlier application by all entities as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period.  The Company has chosen to early adopt the Update for the year ended January 31, 2016. The Company chose to retrospectively adopt these provisions, which  
  
   10 

resulted in reclassifications in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2015, of   $156,000   from current Deferred income taxes to long-term Deferred income taxes . 

Note 4. Inventories 
  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or Net Realizable Value and includes material, labor, and factory overhead. The Company maintains allowances for estimated slow moving and obsolete inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. Allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventory are determined through a physical inspection of the product in connection with a physical inventory, a review of slow-moving product, and consideration of active marketing programs. The market for education furniture is traditionally driven by value, not style, and the Company has not typically incurred significant obsolescence expenses. If market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management, additional allowances may be required. Due to reductions in sales volume in the past years, the Company s manufacturing facilities are operating at reduced levels of capacity. The Company records the cost of excess capacity as a period expense, not as a component of capitalized inventory valuation. 
    
  The following table presents an updated breakdown of the Company s net inventory (in thousands) as of October 31, 2016, January 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015: 

In connection with the preparation of the January 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements, the Company determined that its reserve for excess and obsolete inventory had previously been applied exclusively to the Finished goods portion of inventory, when it should have been applied against Finished goods, Work in process, and Raw materials and supplies, based on the identification of the specific parts determined to be held in excess or obsolete. The Company evaluated the impact of this error on prior year financial statements and concluded that it was immaterial for the quarter ended October 31, 2015, and for all interim periods within the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016. While the amounts included in the prior year disclosure were considered to be immaterial, the Company elected to revise the disclosure of previously reported amounts to be consistent with the presentation as of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016. The changes resulted in no change to Inventories, net. The changes resulted in an increase to Finished goods of   $2,395,000  , a decrease to Work in process of   $1,412,000  , and a decrease to Raw materials and supplies of   $983,000   as of October 31, 2015. 
  Management continually monitors production costs, material costs and inventory levels to determine that interim inventories are fairly stated. 
   
  Note 5. Debt 
  Outstanding balances (in thousands) for the Company s long-term debt were as follows: 

On December 22, 2011, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC ).  The credit agreement currently matures on December 22, 2019 and has a maximum availability of   $49,750,000  , including sub-lines for letters of credit and equipment financing. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus   0.50%   to   1.50%   or the  
  
   11 

Eurodollar Currency Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus   1.50%   to   2.50%  .  The interest rate at October 31, 2016 was   4.5%  . Approximately   $15,020,000   was available for borrowing as of   October 31, 2016  . 
  The Credit Agreement restricts the Company from issuing dividends or making payments with respect to the Company's capital stock to an annual limit of   $1.3 million  , and contains numerous other covenants, including these financial covenants: (1) minimum tangible net worth, (2) fixed charge coverage ratio, and (3) minimum EBITDA amount, in each case as of the end of the relevant monthly, quarterly or annual measurement period.  The Company was in compliance with its covenants during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, substantially all of the Company's accounts receivable are automatically and promptly swept to repay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility upon receipt by the Company.  On April 4, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 12 to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, increased the borrowing availability for the period from June 1, 2016 through August 15, 2016 and modified the clean down provision to reduce borrowings under the line to less than   $6,000,000   from a period of   60   consecutive days to   30   consecutive days.  On October 27, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 13 to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, reduced the maximum availability of    $49,750,000   to   $49,500,000   to allow for a sub-line for the company's credit card program.  
  The Company believes that the Revolving Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its capital requirements for at least in the next 12 months.  Management believes that the carrying value of debt approximated fair value at   October 31, 2016   and 2015, as all of the long-term debt bears interest at variable rates based on prevailing market conditions. 
   
  Note 6. Income Taxes 
  The Company recognizes deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC No. 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  At October 31, 2016, the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not to realize the majority of its deferred tax assets, and therefore released its valuation against those assets resulting in a benefit to income taxes of   $17,962,000  .  The Company has left a partial valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets that the Company does not believe it is more-likely-than-not to realize. 
    
  The year January 31, 2014 and subsequent years remain open for examination by the IRS.  The fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 and subsequent years remain open for examination by state tax authorities. The Company is not currently under IRS or state examination.  We do not believe that there are any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Note 8. Stock-Based Compensation and Stockholders  Rights 
  Stock Incentive Plans 
  Under the 2011 Plan, the Company may grant an aggregate of   2,000,000   shares to its employees and non-employee directors in the form of stock options or awards.  Restricted stock or stock units awarded under the 2011 Plan are expensed ratably over the vesting period of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of its restricted stock unit awards and related compensation expense as the difference between the market value of the awards on the date of grant less the exercise price of the awards granted.  There were   87,284   awards granted and   223,174   awards were vested during the second quarter ended July 31, 2016.  There were no additional awards granted or vested during the third quarter ended October 31, 2016.  There were approximately   746,236   shares available for future issuance under the 2011 Plan as of   October 31, 2016  .

  Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
  The following table presents a summary of restricted stock and stock unit awards at   October 31, 2016   and   2015  : 

Note 9. Stockholders  Equity 
    
  In June 2015, the Board of Directors terminated the Company's common stock repurchase plan.  Pursuant to the Company s Credit Agreement with PNC, the Company is generally prohibited from repurchasing any shares of its stock except in cases where a repurchase is financed by a substantially concurrent issuance of new shares of the Company s common stock.  On April 4, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 12 to the Credit Agreement with PNC which, among other things, amended the restrictions on cash dividends and share repurchases to allow repurchases under certain circumstances and within certain dollar limitations.  

Note 10. Retirement Plans 
  The Company and its subsidiaries cover certain employees under a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan, entitled the Virco Employees  Retirement Plan (the  Pension Plan ). Benefits under the Employees Retirement Plan are based on years of service and career average earnings. As more fully described in the Form 10-K, benefit accruals under the Employees Retirement Plan were frozen effective December 31, 2003. 
  The Company also provides a supplementary retirement plan for certain key employees, the VIP Retirement Plan (the  VIP Plan ). The VIP Plan provides a benefit of up to   50%   of average compensation for the last   5   years in the VIP Plan, offset by benefits earned under the Pension Plan. As more fully described in the Form 10-K, benefit accruals under this plan were frozen effective December 31, 2003. 
  The Company also provides a non-qualified plan for certain former non-employee directors of the Company (the  Non-Employee Directors Retirement Plan ). The Non-Employee Directors Retirement Plan provides a lifetime annual retirement  
  
   13 

benefit equal to the director s annual retainer fee for the fiscal year in which the director terminated his or her position with the Board, subject to the director having provided   10   years of service to the Company. As more fully described in the Form 10-K, benefit accruals under this plan were frozen effective December 31, 2003. 
  The net periodic pension cost (income) for the Pension Plan, the VIP Plan, and the Non-Employee Directors Retirement Plan for the three months and nine months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

Note 11. Warranty Accrual 
  The Company provides a warranty against all substantial defects in material and workmanship. In 2005 the Company extended its standard warranty from   5   years to   10   years.  Effective February 1, 2014 the Company modified its warranty to a limited lifetime warranty. The new warranty effective February 1, 2014 is not anticipated to have a significant effect on warranty expense. The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based upon both product sales data and an analysis of actual warranty claims incurred.  
  The following is a summary of the Company s warranty-claim activity for the three months and nine months ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  .

Note 12. Subsequent Events 
  We have evaluated subsequent events to assess the need for potential recognition or disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such events were evaluated through the date these financial statements were issued. Based upon this evaluation, it was determined that no subsequent events occurred that required recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  Results of Operations 
  The Company s business activity and results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended October 31, 2016 reflected a modest improvement in revenue with stable operating profit compared to the prior year.  Most states tax revenues have recovered to levels existing prior to the 2008 recession and the Company s order rates have been reflecting this improvement.  However, bond funded new school construction and major renovations continue to remain at levels well below levels experienced prior to the recession. 
  Virco s business is extremely seasonal, with approximately 50% of the company s annual revenue occurring in the months of June, July, and August.  Orders are nearly as seasonal with approximately 45% of annual orders received in May, June, and July. Typically, June is the largest month for orders followed by July. The current year largely followed the traditional seasonal norms, with a slight shift from orders traditionally received in July shifting to August. 
  Year-to-date net sales at October 31, 2016 increased by less than 1% to $149,976,000 in the current year compared to $149,100,000 in the same period last year.  Our order backlog at October 31, 2016 increased by approximately $0.5 million compared to the prior year. 
  For the three months ended October 31, 2016, the Company earned a pre-tax profit of $6,206,000 compared to a pre-tax profit of $6,140,000 in the same period last year. 
  Net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2016 increased to $67,795,000, an increase of $2,814,000, or 4.3%, compared to $64,981,000 during the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in selling volume. 
  Gross margin as a percentage of sales for the three months ended October 31, 2016 improved to 35.9% compared to 35.7% in the prior year. The increased gross margin was attributable to stable selling prices and material costs and efficiencies in production due to our enhanced stocking program.  The Company incurred higher steel prices for purchases in the quarter, but the majority of goods sold were produced earlier in the year and did not bear the higher steel costs.  For the current year the Company carried larger quantities of inventory going in to the seasonally high shipping season which facilitated efficiencies in both manufacturing and service costs. 
  Improvements in margin were offset by an increase in variable selling expenses, technology expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Interest expense decreased slightly compared to the prior year. 
  For the nine months ended October 31, 2016, the Company earned a pre-tax profit of $10,123,000 compared to a pre-tax profit of $10,490,000 in the same period last year. 
  Net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 were $149,976,000, an increase of $876,000 or 0.6% increase, compared to $149,100,000 in the same period last year. This increase was the result of an increase in unit volume. 
  Gross margin as a percentage of sales improved to 37.4% for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 compared to 37.2% in the same period last year.  The improvement in gross margin was attributable to stable selling prices and material costs, and efficiencies related to our earlier build of inventory, which offset a slight reduction in production levels.  Factory production hours for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 decreased by 3.5% compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of production. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 increased by approximately $1,144,000 compared to the same period last year.  This increase was the result of variable selling expenses, technology expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Interest expense decreased slightly compared to the prior year. 
  The company incurred a significant increase in steel costs during the summer shipping season.  Because the majority of the products shipped during this period were manufactured earlier in the year, the cost of steel did not significantly impact margins.  The cost may adversely impact fourth quarter sales.  The Company will implement pricing strategies beginning in the next fiscal year to recover increased costs for steel. 
  The Company recognizes deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Due to operating losses, the Company established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011.  During the third quarter ended October 31, 2016, management concluded that the Company's return to consistent profitability made it more likely than not that the majority of the deferred tax assets would be realized and a $17,962,000 favorable adjustment to the valuation allowance was recorded.  This was a non-cash benefit. 

16 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Interest expense decreased for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period last year.  This is primarily due to decreased average levels of borrowing under the Company's credit facility with PNC Bank to fund inventory.  Borrowings under the Company's revolving line of credit with PNC Bank at October 31, 2016 increased by approximately $650,000 compared to October 31, 2015 primarily due to increased levels of inventory and timing of payables. 
  Accounts receivable was lower at October 31, 2016 than at October 31, 2015.  Because the Company carried larger inventories going in to the seasonally high summer shipping period, the Company was able to improve customer service and ship a higher proportion of complete orders.  The enhanced customer service facilitated faster collection of receivables and contributed to a lower receivable balance at October 31, 2016 despite increasing sales by more than 4% in the third quarter revenue.  The Company traditionally builds large quantities of inventory during the first and second quarters of each fiscal year in anticipation of seasonally high summer shipments. At the end of the third quarter, inventory increased by approximately $2,950,000 compared to January 31, 2016 and increased by $4,487,000 compared to October 31, 2015.  The increased levels of inventory are carried to support an enhanced quick ship program which promises shipment of a variety of education products within 72 hours and improved performance on a wide variety of education furniture.  The seasonal fluctuation in inventory levels (including the typically large buildup in inventory during the first and second quarters) was financed through the Company's credit facility with PNC Bank and cash provided by operations. 
  The Company adopted a goal of limiting capital spending to less than $4,000,000 for fiscal year ending January 31, 2017, which is less than the Company's anticipated depreciation expense. Capital spending for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 exceeded our target and was $3,239,000 compared to $3,583,000 for the same period last year. The capital expenditures were largely attributable to spending on information systems and other technology.  Capital expenditures are being financed through the Company's credit facility with PNC Bank and cash flow from operations. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, was $6,967,000 compared to $10,294,000 for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased levels of inventory and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company has generally relied upon its cash flows from operations and unused borrowing capacity with PNC Bank (which was $15,020,000 as of October 31, 2016) to fund the Company's capital expenditures and working capital needs. 
  The Company believes that cash flows from operations, together with the Company's unused borrowing capacity with PNC Bank will be sufficient to fund the Company's capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next twelve months. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  None. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The Company's critical accounting policies are outlined in its Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the quarter ended October 31, 2016.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer along with its Principal Financial Officer  ,   of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) as of October 31, 2016. Based upon the foregoing, the Company's Principal Executive Officer along with the Company's Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of such date were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Company management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

PART II   Other Information 
    
  Virco Mfg. Corporation 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which, in the opinion of the Company, are not material in that management either expects that the Company will be successful on the merits of the pending cases or that any liabilities resulting from such cases will be substantially covered by insurance.  While it is impossible to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these actions, management believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities will not be material to the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors

The risk factors associated with our business have not materially changed compared to the risk factors disclosed in the Form 10-K.
