NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of PEDEVCO CORP.
( PEDEVCO  or the  Company ), have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ) and should be read in conjunction with the
audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in
PEDEVCO s latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form
10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of
the financial position and the results of operations for the
interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results
of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the
financial statements that would substantially duplicate disclosures
contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent
fiscal year, as reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016,
have been omitted. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and
subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial
interest. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

NOTE 2   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

PEDEVCO s
primary business plan is engaging in the acquisition, exploration,
development and production of oil and natural gas shale plays in
the United States, with a secondary focus on conventional oil and
natural gas plays. The Company plans to focus on the development of
shale oil and gas assets held by the Company in the U.S., including
its oil and gas working interests in the Wattenberg and Wattenberg
Extension in the D-J Basin (the  D-J Basin
Asset ). 

The
Company s principal operating properties are located in the
Wattenberg, Wattenberg Extension, and Niobrara formation in the
Denver-Julesburg Basin (the  D-J Basin ) in Weld
County, Colorado all of which properties are owned by the Company
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC
( Red Hawk ). 

The
Company plans to focus on the development of shale oil and gas
assets held by the Company in the U.S., including its oil and gas
working interests in the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension in the
D-J Basin (the  D-J Basin Asset ). 

The
Company plans to seek additional shale oil and gas and conventional
oil and gas asset acquisition opportunities in the U.S. through
utilizing its strategic relationships and technologies that may
provide the Company a competitive advantage in accessing and
exploring such assets. Some or all of these assets may be acquired
by existing subsidiaries or other entities that may be formed at a
future date. 

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements
herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the
accounts of the Company and those of its wholly and partially-owned
subsidiaries as follows: (i) Blast AFJ, Inc., a Delaware
corporation; (ii) Pacific Energy Development Corp., a Nevada
corporation; (iii) Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC, a
Nevada limited liability company (owned 70% by us)(which was
dissolved in April 2016 with an effective date of December 31,
2015); (iv) Pacific Energy   Rare Earth Limited, a Hong Kong
company; (v) Blackhawk Energy Limited, a British Virgin Islands
company; (vi) White Hawk Petroleum, LLC, a Nevada limited liability
company; (vii) Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC, a Nevada limited liability
company; (viii) Pacific Energy Development MSL, LLC (owned 50% by
us) (which was dissolved in September 2016) and is included in our
consolidated results; (ix) PEDEVCO Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a
Texas corporation which was formed on May 21, 2015 in connection
with the planned reorganization transaction with Dome Energy, Inc.
( Dome Energy ), which was subsequently terminated
(which entity was dissolved in April 2016); and (x) White Hawk
Energy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, formed on
January 4, 2016 in connection with the planned reorganization
transaction with GOM Holdings, LLC ( GOM ). All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. 

F-5 

Equity Method Accounting for Joint Ventures . A portion of
the Company s oil and gas interests were held in Condor
Energy Technology, LLC ( Condor ), a joint venture
collectively owned with an affiliate of MIE Holdings Corporation
( MIE Holdings , Hong Kong Stock Exchange code:
1555.HK). Condor was a Nevada limited liability company owned 20%
by the Company and 80% by an affiliate of MIE Holdings. The Company
accounted for its 20% ownership in Condor using the equity
method. In February 2015, the Company divested its interest in
Condor. 

Non-Controlling Interests.  The Company is required to
report its non-controlling interests as a separate component of
shareholders  equity. The Company is also required to present
the consolidated net income and the portion of the consolidated net
income allocable to the non-controlling interests and to the
shareholders of the Company separately in its
consolidated statements of operations. Losses applicable to
the non-controlling interests are allocated to the non-controlling
interests even when those losses are in excess of the
non-controlling interests  investment basis. 

Use of Estimates in Financial Statement
Preparation.  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial
statement disclosures. While management believes that the estimates
and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements
are appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates.
Significant estimates generally include those with respect to the
amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves, the fair value of
financial instruments, oil and gas depletion, asset retirement
obligations, and stock-based compensation. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents.  The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, cash equivalents consisted of money market funds
and cash on deposit. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk.  Financial instruments
which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk include cash deposits placed with financial institutions. The
Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may
exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At September 30, 2016,
approximately $385,000 of the Company s cash balances were
uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses on such
accounts. 

Sales
to one customer comprised 51% of the Company s total oil and
gas revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Sales to
two customers comprised 59% and 11%, respectively, of the
Company s total oil and gas revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The Company believes that, in the event
that its primary customers are unable or unwilling to continue to
purchase the Company s production, there are a substantial
number of alternative buyers for its production at comparable
prices. 

Accounts Receivable.  Accounts receivable typically
consist of oil and gas receivables. The Company has classified
these as short-term assets in the balance sheet because the Company
expects repayment or recovery within the next 12 months. The
Company evaluates these accounts receivable for collectability
considering the results of operations of these related entities
and, when necessary, records allowances for expected unrecoverable
amounts. To date, no significant allowances have been recorded.
Included in accounts receivable - oil and gas is $6,000 related to
receivables from joint interest owners. 

Bad Debt Expense.  The Company s ability to collect
outstanding receivables is critical to its operating performance
and cash flows. Accounts receivable are stated at an amount
management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The
Company extends credit in the normal course of business. The
Company regularly reviews outstanding receivables and when the
Company determines that a party may not be able to make required
payments a charge to bad debt expense in the period of
determination is made. Though the Company s bad debts have
not historically been significant, the Company could experience
increased bad debt expense should a financial downturn
occur. 

Equipment.  Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments which extend the
life or improve existing equipment are capitalized. Upon
disposition or retirement of equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss
is reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which are 3 to 10 years. 

F-6 

Oil and Gas Properties, Successful Efforts Method.  The
successful efforts method of accounting is used for oil and gas
exploration and production activities. Under this method, all costs
for development wells, support equipment and facilities, and proved
mineral interests in oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Geological and geophysical costs are expensed when incurred. Costs
of exploratory wells are capitalized as exploration and evaluation
assets pending determination of whether the wells find proved oil
and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated
quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions, (i.e., prices and costs as of
the date the estimate is made). Prices include consideration of
changes in existing prices provided only by contractual
arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
conditions. 

Exploratory
wells in areas not requiring major capital expenditures are
evaluated for economic viability within one year of completion of
drilling. The related well costs are expensed as dry holes if it is
determined that such economic viability is not attained. Otherwise,
the related well costs are reclassified to oil and gas properties
and subject to impairment review. For exploratory wells that are
found to have economically viable reserves in areas where major
capital expenditure will be required before production can
commence, the related well costs remain capitalized only if
additional drilling is under way or firmly planned. Otherwise the
related well costs are expensed as dry holes. 

Exploration
and evaluation expenditures incurred subsequent to the acquisition
of an exploration asset in a business combination are accounted for
in accordance with the policy outlined above. 

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties is
calculated on a field by field basis using the unit of production
method. Lease acquisition costs are amortized over the total
estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves and all other
capitalized costs are amortized over proved developed
reserves. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  The Company reviews
the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical
cost-carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The
Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset
by estimating the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the
future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value
of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the
difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated
fair value. 

Asset Retirement Obligations.  If a reasonable estimate
of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation,
dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, the
Company will record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or
 ARO ) on its consolidated balance sheet and capitalize
the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas
properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is
incurred. In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs
capitalized will be equal to the estimated future cost to satisfy
the abandonment obligation assuming the normal operation of the
asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed
inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then
discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was
incurred using an assumed cost of funds for the Company. After
recording these amounts, the ARO will be accreted to its future
estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds and the
capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis
over the estimated proved developed reserves. Both the accretion
and the depreciation will be included in depreciation, depletion
and amortization expense on our consolidated statements of
operations. 

F-7 

The
following table describes changes in our asset retirement
obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 (in thousands): 

Revenue Recognition.  All revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service or sale
is complete, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability
is reasonably assured. Revenue is derived from the sale of crude
oil and natural gas. Revenue from crude oil and natural gas sales
is recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company follows the
 sales method  of accounting for oil and natural gas
revenue, so it recognizes revenue on all natural gas or crude oil
sold to purchasers, regardless of whether the sales are
proportionate to its ownership in the property. A receivable or
liability is recognized only to the extent that the Company has an
imbalance on a specific property greater than its share of the
expected remaining proved reserves. If collection is uncertain,
revenue is recognized when cash is collected. 

Income Taxes.  The Company utilizes the asset and
liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating
loss and tax credit carry-forwards and for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment
date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying
amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not
that the value of such assets will be realized. 

Stock-Based Compensation.  The Company utilizes the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of
employee stock option awards at the date of grant, which requires
the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected
volatility and expected life. Changes in these inputs and
assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair
value of our share-based compensation. These assumptions are
subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment
to develop. When estimating fair value, some of the assumptions
will be based on, or determined from, external data and other
assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with
stock-based payment arrangements. The appropriate weight to place
on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant
facts and circumstances. 

The
Company estimates volatility by considering the historical stock
volatility. The Company has opted to use the simplified method for
estimating expected term, which is generally equal to the midpoint
between the vesting period and the contractual term. 

Loss per Common Share.  Basic loss per common share equals
net loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per share includes the impact on
dilution from all contingently issuable shares, including options,
warrants and convertible securities. The common stock equivalents
from contingent shares are determined by the treasury stock method.
The Company incurred net losses for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, and therefore, basic and diluted loss per share
for those periods are the same as all potential common equivalent
shares would be anti-dilutive. The Company excluded 3,024,839 and
2,162,540 potentially issuable shares of common stock related to
options, 12,566,079 and 7,753,282 potentially issuable shares of
common stock related to warrants and 1,362,950 and 1,248,638
potentially issuable shares of common stock related to the
conversion of Bridge Notes, due to their anti-dilutive effect for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The Company follows
 Fair Value Measurement 
( ASC 820 ), which clarifies fair value as an exit
price, establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework for measuring
fair value, and requires extended disclosures about fair value
measurements. The provisions of ASC 820 apply to all financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 

F-8 

As
defined in ASC 820, fair value, clarified as an exit price,
represents the amount that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. As a result, fair value is a market-based
approach that should be determined based on assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or a
liability. 

As a
basis for considering these assumptions, ASC 820 defines a
three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the
valuation methodologies in measuring fair value.  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  In April
2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of
Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs. ASU 2015-03 amends previous guidance to require
that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt
discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt
issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The
standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The affected amounts shown on the
Company s balance sheet were a result of reclassifications
within the balance sheet upon adoption of this ASU to conform to
this standard. The Company adopted this ASU during the first
quarter of 2016 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a
material impact on its financial statements (balance sheet amounts
as of December 31, 2015 were also reclassified for comparability
purposes). 

Subsequent Events.  The Company has evaluated all
transactions through the date the consolidated financial statements
were issued for subsequent event disclosure
consideration. 

NOTE 4   OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES 

The
following table summarizes the Company s oil and gas
activities by classification for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016:  

The
depletion recorded for production on proved properties for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounted
to $512,000 compared to $1,064,000 and $2,296,000 compared to
$3,345,000, respectively. The Company did not record any
impairment expense for unproved leasehold costs for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The Company did not record any impairment
of properties subject to amortization for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The Company recorded impairment expense of
$1,337,000 for all unproved leasehold costs for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, as a result of a revision of
management s plans to our re-leasing program due to the
decrease in commodity pricing.

Acquisition of Properties from Dome Energy, Inc. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net additions to oil and
gas properties subject to amortization were $3,650,000, comprised
of the development of the Company s oil and gas properties of
$82,000 and drilling costs related to the acquisition of oil and
gas properties of $3,568,000 with respect to eight non-operated
wells drilled and completed by a third party operator. 

On
November 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with
certain parties including Dome Energy AB and its wholly-owned
subsidiary Dome Energy, Inc. (collectively  Dome
Energy ), pursuant to which Dome Energy agreed to acquire the
Company s interests in these eight wells and fully fund the
Company s proportionate share of all the corresponding
working interest owner expenses with respect to these eight wells.
The Company assigned its interests in these wells to Dome Energy
effective November 18, 2015, and Dome Energy assumed all amounts
owed for the drilling and completion costs corresponding to these
interests acquired from the Company. 

On
March 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement
with Dome Energy, pursuant to which Dome Energy re-conveyed to the
Company the interests in these eight wells assigned to Dome Energy
by the Company on November 18, 2015, with the Company becoming
responsible for its proportionate share of all the working interest
owner expenses, and having the right to receive all corresponding
revenues with respect to these eight wells, from the initial
production date of the wells. As part of this transaction, the
Company also settled $659,000 of outstanding payables due from the
Company to Dome Energy that was accounted for as a purchase price
adjustment to the value of the oil and gas properties
acquired. 

The
following tables summarize the purchase price and allocation of the
purchase price to the net assets acquired (in

Acquisition of Properties from Golden Globe Energy (US)
LLC. 

On
February 23, 2015 (the  Closing ), the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Hawk, completed the acquisition of
approximately 12,977 net acres of oil and gas properties and
interests in 53 gross wells located in the Denver-Julesburg Basin,
Colorado (the  GGE Acquired Assets ) from Golden Globe
Energy (US), LLC ( GGE ). 

As
consideration for the acquisition of the GGE Acquired Assets, the
Company (i) issued to GGE 3,375,000 restricted shares of the
Company s common stock and 66,625 restricted shares of the
Company s then newly-designated Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preferred ) (see Note
11), (ii) assumed approximately $8.35 million of subordinated notes
payable from GGE, and (iii) provided GGE with a one-year option to
acquire the Company s interest in its Kazakhstan opportunity
for $100,000 payable upon exercise of the option pursuant to a Call
Option Agreement. The effective date of the transaction was January
1, 2015, with the exception of all revenues and refunds
attributable to GGE s approximate 49.7% interest in each of
the Loomis 2-1H, Loomis 2-3H and Loomis 2-6H wells, which revenues
and refunds the Company owned from the date of first production,
and which were approximately $467,000 through January 1,
2015.

Disposition of Oil and Gas Properties 

In
February 2015, the Company sold to MIE Jurassic Energy Corp.
( MIEJ ) all of the Company s direct interests in
approximately 945 net acres and interests in three wells owned by
the Company that were operated by Condor, resulting in a gain on
sale of oil and gas properties of $275,000. 

NOTE 5   OTHER CURRENT ASSETS 

On
September 11, 2013, the Company entered into a Shares Subscription
Agreement ( SSA ) to acquire an approximate 51%
ownership in Asia Sixth Energy Resources Limited ( Asia
Sixth ), which held an approximate 60% ownership interest in
Aral Petroleum Capital Limited Partnership ( Aral ), a
Kazakhstan entity. In August 2014 the SSA and related documents
were restructured (the  Aral Restructuring ), in
connection with which the Company received a promissory note in the
principal amount of $10.0 million from Asia Sixth (the  A6
Promissory Note ), which would be converted into a 10.0%
interest in Caspian Energy, Inc. ( Caspian Energy ), an
Ontario, Canada company listed on the NEX board of the TSX Venture
Exchange, upon the consummation of the Aral
Restructuring. 

The
Company entered into an agreement with GGE to convey 50% of our
interests in Asia Sixth in connection with the Continental
Resources, Inc. acquisition ( Continental Acquisition) in
March 2014. 

The
Aral Restructuring was consummated on May 20, 2015, upon which date
the A6 Promissory Note was converted into 23,182,880 shares of
common stock of Caspian Energy. In addition, on the date of
conversion of the A6 Promissory Note, Mr. Frank Ingriselli, our
Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, was appointed as a
non-executive director of Caspian Energy and currently serves as
its Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

In
connection with our GGE Acquisition, on February 23, 2015, we
provided GGE a one-year option to acquire our interest in Caspian
Energy for $100,000 payable upon exercise of the option recorded in
prepaid expenses and other current assets. As a result, the
carrying value of the 23,182,880 shares of common stock of Caspian
Energy which were issued upon conversion of the A6 Promissory Note
at December 31, 2015 was $100,000. The option provided to GGE was
not exercised and expired on February 23, 2016, resulting in the
Company retaining ownership of the 23,182,880 shares of Caspian
Energy. 

In
connection with the Company s May 2016 debt restructuring as
more fully described below in Note 8, the Company entered into a
new Call Option Agreement with GGE, dated May 12, 2016 (the
 GGE Option Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company
provided GGE an option to purchase the 23,182,880 common shares of
Caspian Energy upon payment of $100,000 by GGE to the Company. The
option expires on May 12, 2019, which is the maturity date of the
debt evidenced by that certain Note and Security Agreement, dated
April 10, 2014, as amended on February 23, 2015, and May 12, 2016,
issued by the Company to RJ Credit LLC ( RJC  and the
 RJC Junior Note ), as described below. The $100,000
option is classified as part of other current assets as of
September 30, 2016.

NOTE 6   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 

On
November 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with
Dome Energy pursuant to which Dome Energy agreed to acquire the
Company s interests in eight wells drilled by a third party
operator and fully fund the Company s proportionate share of
all the corresponding working interest owner expenses with respect
to these eight wells. The Company assigned its interests in these
wells to Dome Energy effective November 18, 2015, and Dome Energy
assumed all amounts owed for the drilling and completion costs of
$3,851,000 corresponding to these interests acquired from the
Company. Dome Energy also agreed to pay an additional $250,000 to
the Company in the event the anticipated merger with Dome Energy
was not consummated. In connection with the assignment of these
well interests to Dome Energy, Dome Energy issued a contingent
promissory note to the Company, dated November 19, 2015 (the
 Dome Promissory Note ), with a principal amount of
$250,000, which note was due and payable to the Company on December
29, 2015, upon the termination of the anticipated merger with Dome
Energy. To guarantee payment of the Dome Promissory Note, Dome
Energy deposited $250,000 into an escrow account. During the nine
month period ending September 30, 2016, the Company collected this
receivable of $250,000 related to this transaction. 

On
March 24, 2015, Red Hawk and Dome Energy entered into a Service
Agreement (the  Service Agreement ), pursuant to which
Red Hawk agreed to provide certain human resource augmentation and
accounting services to Dome Energy, of which $156,000 remained due
and payable by Dome Energy to Red Hawk as of December 31, 2015. On
March 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement
Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with Dome Energy
and certain of its affiliated entities, pursuant to which the
Company and Dome Energy agreed to terminate and cancel the Service
Agreement and settle and resolve a number of outstanding matters,
with Dome Energy agreeing to pay to Red Hawk $50,000 on May 2,
2016, in full satisfaction of the amounts due under the Service
Agreement, with all remaining amounts owed forgiven by Red Hawk. As
of September 30, 2016, the receivable is still due from Dome Energy
for $50,000, which amount is owed to Red Hawk as a part of the
Settlement Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, the receivable due
from Dome Energy totaled $406,000. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the net receivable created by the Dome
Promissory Note due from Dome Energy to the Company was reduced to
zero by (i) the collection of the $250,000 as described above, (ii)
forgiveness by the Company of $106,000 due from Dome Energy
pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, and (iii) the recording of an
allowance of $50,000 as a doubtful account (which was recognized as
bad debt expense in selling, general and administrative expense on
the Company s income statement). 

NOTE 7   EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 

Condor Energy Technology, LLC 

In
October 2011, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Condor. The
Company owned 20% of Condor and a subsidiary of MIE Holdings owned
80%. 

The
Company accounted for its 20% ownership in Condor using the equity
method. The Company evaluated its relationship with Condor to
determine if Condor was a variable interest entity
( VIE ) as defined in ASC 810-10, and whether the
Company was the primary beneficiary of Condor, in which case
consolidation with the Company would be required. The Company
determined that Condor qualified as a VIE, however, the Company
concluded that MIE Holdings was the primary beneficiary as a result
of being in control of the Board and its ability to control the
funding commitments to Condor. 

F-12 

Settlement Agreement with MIEJ 

On
February 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement
with MIEJ, the 80% partner in Condor and the lender under that
certain Amended and Restated Secured Subordinated Promissory Note,
dated March 25, 2013, in the principal amount of $6,170,065 (the
 MIEJ Note ). The Settlement Agreement and related
agreements for the disposition of the Company s interest in
Condor contained the following terms: 

The
Company and MIEJ entered into a new Amended and Restated Secured
Subordinated Promissory Note, dated February 19, 2015 (the
 New MIEJ Note ), with a principal amount of $4.925
million, extinguishing the original MIEJ Note; 

The
Company sold to MIEJ (i) its 20% interest in Condor, and (ii) all
of the direct interests in approximately 945 net acres and working
interests in three wells separately owned by the Company and
operated by Condor; 

The
Company s employees were removed as officers of Condor, and
the Company agreed to assist with Condor s accounting and
audits and perform joint interest billing accounting for a monthly
fee of $55,000 for January 2015, $0 for February 2015, $10,000 for
March 2015 and $30,000 per month thereafter, pro-rated for partial
months, through August 2015; 

MIEJ
paid $500,000 to the Company s senior loan investors as a
principal reduction on the Company s senior
notes; 

Condor
forgave approximately $1.8 million in previous working interest
expenses related to the drilling and completion of certain wells
operated by Condor that the Company owed to Condor; 

The
Company paid MIEJ $100,000 as a principal reduction under the
original MIEJ Note; and 

The
parties fully released each other from every claim, demand or cause
of action arising on or before February 19, 2015. 

The net
effect of these transactions with MIEJ was to reduce approximately
$9.4 million in aggregate liabilities due from the Company to MIEJ
and Condor to $4.925 million, which was the new principal amount of
the New MIEJ Note.

NOTE 8   NOTES PAYABLE 

Note Purchase Agreement and Sale of Secured Promissory
Notes 

On
March 7, 2014, the Company entered into a $50 million
financing facility (the  Notes Purchase Agreement )
between the Company, BRe BCLIC Primary, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WNIC
2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, and RJC, as investors
(collectively, the  Investors ), and BAM Administrative
Services LLC, as agent for the Investors (the  Agent ).
The Company issued the Investors Secured Promissory Notes in the
aggregate amount of $34.5 million (the  Initial Notes 
or  Senior Notes ) and provided for an additional $15.5
million available under the financing agreement to fund the
Company s future drilling costs to be evidenced by notes with
substantially similar terms as the Initial Notes (the
 Subsequent Notes ). On March 19, 2015, BRe WNIC 2013
LTC Primary transferred a portion of its Initial Note to HEARTLAND
Bank, and effective April 1, 2015, BRe BCLIC Primary transferred
its Initial Note to Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania
( SHIP ), with each of HEARTLAND Bank and SHIP becoming
an  Investor  for purposes of the discussion
below.  

Pursuant
to letter agreements and amendments thereto entered into with the
holders of the Senior Notes on August 28, 2015, January 29, 2016,
March 7, 2016 and April 1, 2016, certain of the holders agreed to,
among other things, (i) defer until the maturity date of their
Senior Notes the mandatory principal payments that would otherwise
be due and payable by the Company to them on payment dates
occurring from August 2015 through April 2016; and (ii) defer until
the maturity date of their Senior Notes and the RJC Junior Note all
of the interest payments that would otherwise be due and payable by
the Company to them from August 2015 to April 2016, with all
interest amounts deferred being added to principal on the first
business day of the month following the month in which such
deferred interest is accrued. The purpose of these deferrals was to
provide the Company with temporary relief from cash requirements to
fully-focus and execute upon its contemplated business
combinations. 

As
consideration for the note amendments and deferrals, on September
10, 2015, the Company issued warrants exercisable on a cash-only
basis for an aggregate of 1,201,004 shares of common stock to the
lenders, proportionately based on their individual principal. The
warrants have a three year term and are exercisable on a cash-only
basis at a price of $0.75 per share. The fair value of these
1,201,004 warrants of approximately $120,000 was recorded as
additional deferred financing costs. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no payments
made to reduce the outstanding principal due under the Initial
Notes, however, such Notes were restructured as described
below. 

As a
result of the issuance of common and preferred shares in the
acquisition of the assets from GGE in 2015, GGE became a related
party of the Company. 

2016 Senior Note Restructuring 

Following
a series of temporary payment deferrals, on May 12, 2016 (the
 Closing Date ), the Company entered into an Amended
and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (the  Amended
NPA ), with SHIP, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC Primary,
BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, Heartland Bank, BHLN-Pedco Corp.
( BHLN ), BBLN-Pedco Corp. ( BBLN ), and
RJC (together with BHLN and BBLN, the  Tranche A
Investors ) (collectively, the  Lenders ), and
the Agent, as agent for the Lenders. The Amended NPA amended and
restated the Senior Notes, and the Company issued new Senior
Secured Promissory Notes to each of the Lenders (collectively, the
 Tranche B Notes ) in a transaction that qualified as a
troubled debt restructuring. RJC is also a party to the RJC Junior
Note (discussed below). 

F-14 

The
Amended NPA amended the Senior Notes as follows: 

Created new 
 Tranche A Notes,  in substantially the same form and
with similar terms as the Tranche B Notes, except as discussed
below, consisting of a term loan issuable in tranches with a
maximum aggregate principal amount of $25,960,000, with borrowed
funds accruing interest at 15% per annum, and maturing on May 11,
2019 (the  Tranche A Maturity Date ) (the
 Tranche A Notes,  and together with the Tranche B
Notes, the  New Senior Notes ); 

The Company 
capitalized all accrued and unpaid interest under the Tranche B
Notes as a term loan with an aggregate outstanding principal
balance as of May 12, 2016 equal to $39,065,000 (as of September
30, 2016, the aggregate outstanding principal balance is
$41,010,000).The Tranche B Notes mature on June 11, 2019 except for
the Tranche B Note issued to RJC, which matures on July 11,
2019; 

Amended the 
provisions of the Senior Notes which required mandatory prepayments
from our revenues, replacing them with a Net Revenue Sweep as
described below; and 

Provides
that  interest on the Tranche B Notes will continue to accrue
at the rate of 15% per annum, but all accrued interest through
December 31, 2017 will be deferred until due and payable on the
maturity date, with all interest amounts deferred being added to
the principal of the Tranche B Notes on a monthly basis and that
following December 31, 2017, all interest will accrue and be paid
monthly in arrears in cash to the Tranche B Note
holders. 

The
Tranche A Notes are substantially similar to the Tranche B Notes,
except that such notes are senior to the Tranche B Notes, accrue
interest until maturity and have priority to the payment of Monthly
Net Revenues as discussed below. 

On the
Closing Date, the Tranche A Investors loaned the Company their pro
rata share of an aggregate of $6,422,000 (the  Initial
Tranche A Funding ). The Initial Tranche A Funding net
proceeds (amounting to $6,422,000 less legal fees of $127,000) were
used by the Company to (i) fund approximately $5.1 million due to a
third party operator for drilling and completion expenses related
to the acquired working interests in eight wells from Dome Energy,
(ii) pay $750,000 of the Company s past due payables to
Liberty (defined below under  Note 10   Commitments and
Contingencies     Other Commitments ),
(iii) pay $445,000 of unpaid interest payments due to Heartland
Bank under its Tranche B Note through February 29, 2016, and (iv)
pay fees and expenses of $127,000 incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Amended NPA and related
documents. 

Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Amended NPA, the Company may
request each Tranche A Investor, from time to time, to advance to
the Company additional amounts of funding (each, a
 Subsequent Tranche A Funding ), provided that: (i) the
Company may not request a Subsequent Tranche A Funding more than
one time in any calendar month; (ii) Agent shall have received a
written request from the Company at least 15 business days prior to
the requested date of such advance (the  Advance
Request ); (iii) no Event of Default or event that with the
passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would become an
Event of Default (a  Default ) shall have occurred and
be continuing or would result therefrom; and (iv) the Company shall
provide to the Agent such documents, instruments, certificates and
other writings as the Agent shall reasonably require in its sole
and absolute discretion. The advancement of all or any portion of
the Subsequent Tranche A Funding is in the sole and absolute
discretion of the Agent and the Investors and no Investor is
obligated to fund all or any part of the Subsequent Tranche A
Funding. Each Subsequent Tranche A Funding shall be in a minimum
amount of $500,000 and multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. The
aggregate amount of Subsequent Tranche A Fundings that may be made
by the Investors under the Amended NPA shall not exceed $18,577,876
and any Subsequent Tranche A Funding repaid may not be
re-borrowed. 

In
addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended NPA,
RJC agreed to loan to the Company $240,000, within 30 days of the
Closing Date and within 30 days of each of July 1, 2016, October 1,
2016 and January 1, 2017 (collectively, the  RJC
Fundings  and collectively with the Investor Tranche A
Fundings, the  Fundings ), provided that no Event of
Default or Default shall exist. The aggregate amount of the RJC
Fundings made by RJC under the Amended NPA shall not exceed
$960,000 and any Funding repaid may not be re-borrowed. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company has received no loan proceeds under
this agreement. 

F-15 

To
guarantee RJC s obligation in connection with the RJC
Fundings as required under the Amended NPA, GGE entered into a
Share Pledge Agreement with the Company, dated May 12, 2016 (the
 GGE Pledge Agreement ), pursuant to which GGE agreed
to pledge an aggregate of 10,000 shares of the Company s
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by GGE (convertible into
10,000,000 shares of Company common stock), which pledged shares
are subject to automatic cancellation and forfeiture based on a
schedule set forth in the GGE Share Pledge Agreement, in the event
RJC fails to meet each of its RJC Funding obligations pursuant to
the Amended NPA. To date, RJC has not met its RJC Funding
obligations under the Amended NPA and the Company is entitled to
cancel and forfeit 7,500 shares of the Company s Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock held by GGE (convertible into 7,500,000
shares of Company common stock) pursuant to the terms of the GGE
Pledge Agreement, which shares have not been cancelled as of the
date of this filing. 

As
additional consideration for the entry into the Amended NPA and
transactions related thereto, the Company granted to BHLN and BBLN,
warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 5,962,800 shares of common
stock of the Company (the  Investor Warrants ). The
warrants have a 3 year term, are transferrable, and are exercisable
on a cashless basis at any time at $0.25 per share (as amended),
subject to receipt of additional listing approval of such
underlying shares of common stock from the NYSE MKT (which
additional listing approval was received from the NYSE MKT on June
1, 2016). The Investor Warrants include a beneficial ownership
limitation that prohibits the exercise of the Investor Warrants to
the extent such exercise would result in the holder, together with
its affiliates, holding more than 9.99% of the Company s
outstanding voting stock (the  Blocker Provision ). The
estimated fair value of the Investor Warrants issued is
approximately $707,000 based on the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The relative fair value allocated to the Tranche A Notes and
recorded as debt discount was $636,000. 

Other
than the Investor Warrants, no additional warrants exercisable for
common stock of the Company are due, owing, or shall be granted to
the Lenders pursuant to the Senior Notes, as amended. In addition,
warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 349,111 shares of the
Company s common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per
share and warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,201,004 shares
of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.75
per share previously granted by the Company to certain of the
Lenders on September 10, 2015 in connection with prior interest
payment deferrals have been amended and restated to provide that
all such warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and include a
Blocker Provision (the  Amended and Restated
Warrants ). 

Additionally,
the Company also agreed to (a) provide to the Agent and the
Investors a monthly projected general and administrative expense
report (the  Projected G A ) and a monthly
comparison report of the Projected G A provided for the
preceding month, with an explanation of any variances, provided
that in no event shall such variances exceed $150,000, and (B) pay
to the Agent within 2 business days following the end of each
calendar month all of the Company s oil and gas revenue
received by the Company during such month (the  Net Revenue
Sweep ), less (i) lease operating expenses, (ii) interest
payments due to Investors under the New Senior Notes, (iii) general
and administrative expenses not to exceed $150,000 per month unless
preapproved by the Agent (the  G A Cap ), and (iv)
preapproved extraordinary expenses (together the  Monthly Net
Revenues ). Amounts paid to the Agent through the Net Revenue
Sweep are applied first to the repayment of principal and interest
due under the Tranche A Notes until such notes are paid in full and
then to the repayment of principal and interest amounts due under
the Tranche B Notes. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company has paid $499,000 of principal under the Net
Revenue Sweep. The amount of interest deferred under the Tranche A
Notes as of September 30, 2016 equaled $367,000. 

The
amounts outstanding under the New Senior Notes are secured by a
first priority security interest in all of the Company s and
its subsidiaries  assets, property, real property,
intellectual property, securities and proceeds therefrom, granted
in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, pursuant to a
Security Agreement and a Patent Security Agreement, each entered
into as of March 7, 2014, as amended on May 12, 2016 (the
 Amended Security Agreement  and  Amended Patent
Agreement,  respectively). Additionally, the Agent, for the
benefit of the Lenders, was granted a mortgage and security
interest in all of the Company s and its subsidiaries real
property as located in the State of Colorado and the State of Texas
pursuant to (i) a Leasehold Deed of Trust, Fixture Filing,
Assignment of Rents and Leases, and Security Agreements, dated
March 7, 2014, as amended May 12, 2016, filed in Weld County and
Morgan County, Colorado; and (ii) a Mortgage, Deed of Trust,
Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of
Production to be filed in Matagorda County, Texas (collectively,
the  Amended Mortgages ).

Other
than as described above, the terms of the Amended NPA (including
the covenants and obligations thereunder) are substantially the
same as the Senior Notes, and the terms of the Tranche A Notes and
Tranche B Notes (including the events of default, interest rates
and conditions associated therewith) are substantially the same as
the original notes sold pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Notes. 

All
debt discount amounts are amortized using the effective interest
rate method. The total amount of the debt discount reflected on the
accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 was $7,926,000.
Amortization of debt discount and interest expense was $4,638,000
and $5,715,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, and was $882,000 and $2,069,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Junior Debt Restructuring 

On May 12, 2016, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to
Note and Security Agreement with RJC (the  Second
Amendment ). The Company and RJC agreed to amend the RJC
Junior Note to (i) capitalize all accrued and unpaid interest under
the RJC Junior Note as of May 12, 2016, and add it to the note
principal, making the outstanding principal amount of the RJC
Junior Note as of May 12, 2016 equal to $9,379,000, (ii) extend the
maturity date ( Termination Date ) from December 31,
2017 to July 11, 2019, (iii) provide that all future interest
accruing under the RJC Junior Note is deferred until payable on the
Termination Date, with all future interest amounts deferred being
added to the principal on a monthly basis, and (iv) subordinate the
RJC Junior Note to the New Senior Notes. 

Bridge Note Financing 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had Bridge Notes with an aggregate
principal amount of $475,000 remaining outstanding, plus accrued
interest of $159,000 and additional payment-in-kind
( PIK ) of $48,000. The aggregate principal and accrued
and unpaid interest and PIK amounts are available for
conversion into common stock pursuant to the terms of the Bridge
Notes into common stock of the Company, subject to no more than
19.99% of the Company s outstanding common stock on the date
the Second Amended Notes were entered into. Upon a conversion, the
applicable holder shall receive that number of shares of common
stock as is determined by dividing the Conversion Amount by a
conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) as
follows: 

(A) 

prior
to June 1, 2014, the Conversion Price was $2.15 per share;
and 

(B) 

following June 1,
2014, the denominator used in the calculation described above is
the greater of (i) 80% of the average of the closing price per
share of the Company s publicly-traded common stock for the
five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the
conversion notice provided by the holder; and (ii) $0.50 per
share. 

Additionally,
each Amended Bridge Investor entered into a Subordination and
Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Agent, subordinating and
deferring the repayment of the Bridge Notes until full repayment of
certain senior notes. The Subordination and Intercreditor
Agreements also prohibit the Company from repaying the Bridge Notes
until certain senior notes have been paid in full, except that we
are allowed to repay the Bridge Notes from net proceeds received
from the sale of common or preferred stock (i) in calendar year
2014 if such net proceeds received in such calendar year exceeds
$35,000,000, (ii) in calendar year 2015 if such net proceeds
received in such calendar year exceeds $50,000,000, and (iii) in
calendar year 2016 if such net proceeds actually received in such
calendar year exceeds $50,000,000, none of which has occurred to
date. The interest expense related to these notes for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $15,000 compared
to $14,000 and $43,000 compared to $43,000,
respectively. 

The
unamortized debt premium on the Convertible Bridge Notes as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was
$113,000. 

F-17 

MIE Jurassic Energy Corporation 

On
February 14, 2013, PEDCO entered into a Secured Subordinated
Promissory Note, as amended on March 25, 2013 and July 9, 2013 (the
 MIEJ Note , as amended through December 31, 2014) with
MIEJ. 

In
February 2015, the Company and PEDCO entered into a Settlement
Agreement with MIEJ (the  MIEJ Settlement Agreement ).
As part of the MIEJ Settlement Agreement, the Company entered into
a new Secured Subordinated Promissory Note, which extinguished the
original MIEJ Note, and reduced the principal amount owed from
$6.17 million to $4.925 million (the  New MIEJ Note ).
As of September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding under the New MIEJ
Note was $4,925,000. The Company recognized a gain on debt
extinguishment during the three months ended March 31, 2015 related
to these transactions of $2,192,000. 

The New
MIEJ Note has an interest rate of 10.0%, with no interest due until
maturity, is secured by all of the Company s assets, and is
subordinated to the Secured Promissory Notes. MIEJ also agreed to
subordinate its note up to an additional $60 million of new senior
lending, with any portion of new senior lending in excess of this
amount requiring to be paid first to MIEJ until the New MIEJ Note
is paid in full. Further, for every $20 million in new senior
lending the Company raises, MIEJ shall be paid all interest and
fees accrued to date on the New MIEJ Note. The New MIEJ Note was
due and payable on March 8, 2017, subject to automatic
extensions upon the occurrence of a Long Term Financing or PEDEVCO
Senior Lending Restructuring (each as defined below), which as
described below has occurred to date. 

On a
onetime basis, the Secured Promissory Notes may be refinanced by a
new loan ( Long-Term Financing ) by one or more third
party replacement lenders ( Replacement Lenders ), and
in such event the Company shall undertake commercially reasonable
best efforts to cause the Replacement Lenders to simultaneously
refinance both the Secured Promissory Notes and the New MIEJ Note
as part of such Long-Term Financing. If the Replacement Lenders are
unable or unwilling to include the New MIEJ Note in such financing,
then the Long-Term Financing may proceed without including the New
MIEJ Note, and the New MIEJ Note shall remain in place and shall be
automatically subordinated, without further consent of MIEJ, to
such Long-Term Financing. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a
Long-Term Financing, the maturity of the New MIEJ Note is
automatically extended to the same maturity date of the Long-Term
Financing, but to no later than March 8, 2020. Additionally, in
connection with the Long-Term Financing: 

The
Long-Term Financing must not exceed $95 million; 

The
Company must make commercially reasonable best efforts to include
adequate reserves or other payment provisions whereby MIEJ is paid
all interest and fees accrued on the New MIEJ Note commencing as of
March 8, 2017 and annually thereafter, and to allow for quarterly
interest payments starting March 31, 2017 of not less than 5% per
annum on the outstanding balance of the New MIEJ Note, plus a
one-time payment of accrued interest (not to exceed $500,000) as of
March 31, 2017; and 

Commencing on
March 8, 2017, MIEJ shall have the right to convert the balance of
the New MIEJ Note into the Company s common stock at a price
equal to 80% of the average closing price per share of our stock
over the then previous 60 days, subject to a minimum conversion
price of $0.30 per share. MIEJ shall not be permitted to convert if
the conversion would result in MIEJ holding more than 19.9% of the
Company s outstanding common stock without approval from the
Company s shareholders, which the Company has agreed to seek
at its 2016 annual shareholder meeting or, if not approved then, at
its 2017 annual shareholder meeting. 

In the
event the Secured Promissory Notes are not refinanced, restructured
or extended by the existing Investors, the maturity of both the New
MIEJ Note and the Secured Promissory Notes may be extended to no
later than March 8, 2019, without requiring the consent of MIEJ.
However, (i) any such maturity extension of the New MIEJ Note will
give MIEJ the right to convert the note into our common stock as
described above, commencing on March 8, 2017, and (ii) such
extension agreement must provide that MIEJ is paid all interest and
fees accrued on the New MIEJ Note as of March 8, 2018. The New MIEJ
Note may be prepaid any time without penalty. 

As a
result of the Company s May 2016 senior debt restructuring
pursuant to the Amended NPA (as described above under  Note
Purchase Agreement and Sale of Secured Promissory Notes 
   2016 Senior Note Restructuring ), the maturity
date of the New MIEJ Note has automatically been extended to March
8, 2019 and MIEJ has the Right of Conversion (described above)
beginning on March 8, 2017. 

F-18 

The
interest expense related to this note for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $123,000 compared to $41,000
and $371,000 compared to $367,000, respectively. 

For
financial reporting purposes, MIEJ was considered a related party
for all periods presented prior to the MIEJ Settlement Agreement
signed in February 2015. After that date, MIEJ was no longer
considered a related party.

Subordinated Note Payable Assumed 

In
2015, the Company assumed approximately $8.35 million of
subordinated note payable from GGE in the acquisition of the GGE
Acquired Assets. The amount outstanding as of September 30, 2016
equaled $9,868,000. The lender under the subordinated note payable
is RJC, which is one of the lenders under the Senior Notes and is
an affiliate of GGE. The note was originally due and payable on
December 31, 2017. The assumed note payable is subordinate and
subject to the terms and conditions of the Senior Notes, as well as
any future secured indebtedness from a lender with an aggregate
principal amount of at least $20,000,000. Should the Company repay
the Senior Notes or replace them with secured indebtedness from a
lender with an aggregate principal amount of at least $20,000,000,
RJC agreed to further amend the subordinated note payable to adjust
the frequency of interest payments or to eliminate the payments and
replace them with a single payment of the accrued interest to be
paid at maturity.  

As
consideration for deferral of payments and related note amendments,
on September 10, 2015, the Company granted RJC warrants exercisable
on a cash-only basis for an aggregate of 265,241 shares (which are
included in the aggregate total of 1,201,004 shares issuable upon
exercise of warrants issued to the Investors as described above
under  Note Purchase Agreement and Sale of Secured Promissory
Notes  in the Notes above). The warrants have a three year
term and were exercisable on a cash-only basis at a price of $0.75
per share. 

The
interest expense related to this note for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $297,000 compared to $74,000
and $858,000 compared to $430,000, respectively. 

2016 RJC Subordinated Note Deferrals 

On
January 29, 2016 and March 7, 2016, the Company entered into
agreements with RJC to defer until maturity the payment of interest
and principal due under the subordinated note through March 31,
2016, and return the interest rate to 12% per annum effective
January 31, 2016. 

The
deferral period was further extended on May 12, 2016, on which date
the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to Note and Security
Agreement with RJC (the  Second Amendment ). The
Company and RJC agreed to amend the RJC Junior Note to (i)
capitalize all accrued and unpaid interest under the RJC Junior
Note as of May 12, 2016, and add it to the note principal, making
the outstanding principal amount of the RJC Junior Note as of June
12 2016 equal to $9,379,432, (ii) extend the maturity date
( Termination Date ) from December 31, 2017 to July 11,
2019, (iii) provide that all future interest accruing under the RJC
Junior Note is deferred until payable on the Termination Date, with
all future interest amounts deferred being added to the principal
on a monthly basis, and (iv) subordinate the RJC Junior Note to the
New Senior Notes. The warrants previously issued to RJC on
September 10, 2015 were also amended to provide that such warrants
are exercisable on a cashless basis and to include a Blocker
Provision. 

For the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, interest deferred and
capitalized since May 12, 2016, under Amendment No. 2 to the Note
amounted to $488,000 and amounted to a total deferred of $950,000
since January 1, 2016. The outstanding principal amount of the
RJC Junior Note as of September 30, 2016 was equal to
$9,868,000.

NOTE 9   INCOME TAXES 

Due to
the Company s net losses, there was no provision for income
taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. 

The
difference between the income tax expense of zero shown in the
statement of operations and pre-tax book net loss times the federal
statutory rate of 34% is principally due to the increase in the
valuation allowance. 

Changes
in deferred income tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): 

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of deferred assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. 

Based
on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully
realizable. Accordingly, management has applied a full valuation
allowance against its net deferred tax assets at September 30,
2016. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was an increase of
$4,100,000. 

The
Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties
accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income
tax expense. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any
significant uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company did not have associated accrued interest or penalties,
nor were any interest expense or penalties recognized during the
period from February 9, 2011 (Inception) through September 30,
2016. 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had gross net operating loss
carryforwards ( NOLs ) of approximately $123,116,000 of
which $49,922,000 are subject to limitations for federal and state
tax purposes. If not utilized, these losses will begin to expire
beginning in 2032 and 2023, respectively, for both federal and
state purposes. 

Utilization
of NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial
annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have
occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by the
Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ), as amended, as well
as similar state provisions. In general, an  ownership
change  as defined by the Code results from a transaction or
series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an
ownership change of more than 50% of the outstanding stock of a
company by certain stockholders or public groups. 

Due to
the impact of temporary and permanent differences between the book
and tax calculations of net loss, the Company experiences an
effective tax rate above the federal statutory rate of
34%.

NOTE 10   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Office Lease 

In May
2016, the Company entered into a lease addendum to the original
lease agreement signed in July 2012, as amended, which extends the
term of the lease by an additional one year, now ending in July
2017, for its corporate office space located in Danville,
California. The obligation under this one year lease extension for
the remainder of 2016 and the first seven months of 2017 is
$47,000. 

In
September 2014, the Company entered into a lease agreement for
office space located in Houston, Texas, with a term of five years
ending on March 1, 2020, which location served as the
Company s operations office. Effective April 1, 2016, the
Company terminated this lease agreement and issued the landlord
700,000 shares of common stock valued at $161,000, with no further
obligations due thereunder. 

Leasehold Drilling Commitments 

The
Company s oil and gas leasehold acreage is subject to
expiration of leases if the Company does not drill and hold such
acreage by production. In the D-J Basin Asset, 5 net acres are due
to expire during the three months remaining in 2016 (4,602 net
acres did expire during the nine months ended September 30, 2016),
584 net acres expire in 2017, 392 net acres expire in 2018, 127 net
acres expire in 2019, and 1,290 net acres expire thereafter. Where
the Company is not able to drill and complete a well before lease
expiration, the Company may seek to extend leases where
able. In March 2015, the Company fully impaired its unproved
leasehold costs based on management s revised re-leasing
program, however, it continues to retain its rights to the
unexpired leases.   

Other Commitments 

On
December 18, 2015, a complaint was filed against Red Hawk, our
wholly-owned subsidiary, in the District Court, County of Weld,
State of Colorado (Case Number: 2015CV31079) (the
 Court ), pursuant to which Liberty Oilfield Services,
LLC ( Liberty ) made various claims against Red Hawk in
connection with certain completion services provided by Liberty to
Red Hawk in November and December 2014, and accrued in accounts
payable as of December 31, 2014. The complaint alleges causes of
action for foreclosure of lien, breach of contract, quantum meruit
and account stated, and seeks payment of amounts allegedly owed,
pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys  fees and court
costs in connection with Red Hawk s alleged failure to pay
Liberty approximately $2.9 million in fees due for completion
services provided by Liberty. On May 12, 2016, the Company and
Liberty entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to
which the Company paid to Liberty $750,000 and issued 2,450,000
fully-vested shares of the Company s restricted common stock,
valued at $588,000, based on the market price on the grant date, as
full settlement of all amounts due for the services previously
rendered, for which the Company owed approximately $2.6 million. As
a result of the settlement, the Company recognized a gain on
settlement of payables of $1,282,000 during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Although
we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims
arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we
are not currently a party to any material legal proceeding. In
addition, we are not aware of any material legal or governmental
proceedings against us, or contemplated to be brought against
us. 

As part
of its regular operations, the Company may become party to various
pending or threatened claims, lawsuits and administrative
proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning its
commercial operations, products, employees and other
matters. 

Although
the Company provides no assurance about the outcome of these or any
other pending legal and administrative proceedings and the effect
such outcomes may have on the Company, the Company believes that
any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such
proceedings, to the extent not otherwise provided for or covered by
insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company s financial condition or results of
operations.

NOTE 11   SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 

PREFERRED STOCK 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000
shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, of which
66,625 shares have been designated  Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock  (the  Series A
Preferred ). 

On
February 23, 2015, the Company issued 66,625 Series A Preferred to
GGE as part of the consideration paid for the GGE Acquired Assets.
The fair value of the Series A Preferred was $28,402,000 based on a
calculation using a binomial lattice model. See Note
14. 

The
66,625 shares of Series A Preferred issued to GGE are redeemable
and contingently convertible in 4 tranches as follows: (i) 15,000
shares in Tranche One; (ii) 15,000 shares in Tranche Two; (iii)
11,625 shares in Tranche Three; and (iv) 25,000 shares in Tranche
Four. 

In
addition, the 66,625 shares of Series A Preferred issued to GGE
originally had the following features: 

a
liquidation preference senior to all of the Company s common
stock equal to $400 per share; 

a
dividend, payable annually, of 10% of the liquidation
preference; 

voting
rights on all matters, with each share having 1 vote;
and 

a
conversion feature at GGE s option, which must be approved by
a majority of the shareholders of the Company which will allow the
Series A Preferred to be converted into shares of the
Company s common stock on a 1,000:1 basis. 

However,
following the October 7, 2015, approval of the Company shareholders
of the issuance of shares of common stock upon the conversion of
the Series A Preferred, the Series A Preferred features have been
modified as follows: 

the
Series A Preferred ceased accruing dividends and all accrued and
unpaid dividends have been automatically forfeited and forgiven;
and 

the
liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred has been reduced
to $0.001 per share from $400 per share. 

GGE was
also subject to a lock-up provision that prohibited it from selling
the shares of common stock through the public markets for less than
$1 per share (on an as-converted to common stock basis) until
February 23, 2016, and in no event may GGE convert shares of Series
A Preferred if upon such conversion it would beneficially own more
than 9.99% of our outstanding common stock or voting
stock. 

The
Series A Preferred ceased being redeemable on November 23, 2015,
per the Series A Certification of Designations, if the Company did
not repurchase any shares within nine months of the initial Series
A issuance, the Company lost the right to redeem any of the Series
A Preferred and the holder also lost the right to force any
redemption. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 66,625 shares
of the Company s Series A Preferred outstanding, 7,500 shares
of which are subject to cancellation and forfeiture as described
further in Note 8 above due to RJC s failure to meet its RJC
Funding obligations under the Amended NPA. 

COMMON STOCK 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company was authorized to issue 200,000,000
shares of its common stock with a par value of $0.001 per
share. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued shares
of common stock or restricted common stock as follows: 

F-22 

On
January 7, 2016, the Company issued 1,750,000 shares of its
restricted common stock with a fair value of $385,000, based on the
market price on the date of issuance, to certain of its employees,
including 600,000 shares to its Chairman and then Chief Executive
Officer, Frank C. Ingriselli, 600,000 shares to its President and
then Chief Financial Officer, Michael L. Peterson, and 550,000
shares to its Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Clark
R. Moore, all pursuant to the Company s 2012 Amended and
Restated Equity Incentive Plan and in connection with the
Company s 2015 annual equity incentive compensation review
process. 50% of the shares vest on the six month anniversary of the
grant date, 30% vest on the twelve month anniversary of the grant
date and 20% vest on the eighteen month anniversary of the grant

Blast Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary of the
Company ( MergerCo ), and Pacific Energy Development

pursuant to which MergerCo was merged with and into PEDCO, with
PEDCO continuing as the surviving entity and becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in a transaction structured
to qualify as a tax-free reorganization (the  Merger ),
the Company assumed the PEDCO 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the
 PEDCO Incentive Plan ), which was adopted by PEDCO on

the Company and remaining subject to the PEDCO Incentive Plan
following the consummation of the merger). The Company does not
plan to grant any additional awards under the PEDCO Incentive
Plan.

and fully vest in January 2018. 50% vest six months from the date
of grant, 30% vest one year from the date of grant and 20% vest
eighteen months from the date of grant, all contingent upon the
recipient s continued service with the Company. The aggregate
fair value of the options on the date of grant, using the
Black-Scholes model, was $183,000. Variables used in the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the options issued include:
(1) a discount rate of 1.61%, (2) expected term of 3.5 years, (3)

Warrants 

On May
12, 2016, as consideration for the entry into the Amended NPA, the
Company granted to BHLN and BBLN, warrants exercisable for an
aggregate of 5,962,800 shares of common stock of the Company (the
 Investor Warrants ). The warrants have a 3 year term,
are transferrable, and are exercisable on a cashless basis at any
time at $0.25 per share, subject to receipt of additional listing
approval of such underlying shares of common stock from the NYSE
MKT (which additional listing approval was received from the NYSE
MKT on June 1, 2016). The Investor Warrants include a beneficial
ownership limitation that prohibits the exercise of the Investor
Warrants to the extent such exercise would result in the holder,
together with its affiliates, holding more than 9.99% of the
Company s outstanding voting stock (the  Blocker
Provision ). The estimated fair value of the Investor
Warrants issued is approximately $707,000 based on the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The relative fair value
allocated to the Tranche A Notes and recorded as debt discount was
$636,000.

payment deferrals have been amended and restated to provide that
all of such warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and
include a Blocker Provision (the  Amended and Restated
Warrants ).

the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recognized warrant expense of $-0- compared to $19,000 and
$-0- compared to $669,000, respectively. The remaining amount of

Series A Convertible Preferred issued to GGE which can be converted
into shares of the Company s common stock on a 1,000:1 basis
as described in greater detail in Note 11 above) and the

NOTE 14   FAIR VALUE 

As
defined in our accounting policy on the fair value of financial
instruments, financial assets and liabilities are classified based
on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of
a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment,
and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and
liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy
levels.

The
Company believes there is no active market or significant other
market data for the Series A Preferred as it is held by a limited
number of closely held entities, therefore the Company has
determined it should use Level 3 inputs. 

The
Series A Convertible Preferred was valued using the binomial
lattice model of which the significant assumptions were the
expected term and expected volatility. The binomial lattice model
used a probablistic approach in which the Company assigned
percentages to each scenario based on the chance of repayment.
The percentages used were as follows: the non-repayment scenario
was assigned a 25% probability and the repayment scenario was
assigned a 75% probability.

General Overview 

We are
an energy company engaged primarily in the acquisition,
exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas
shale plays in the Denver-Julesberg Basin (  D-J Basin  ) in Colorado,
which contains hydrocarbon bearing deposits in several formations,
including the Niobrara, Codell, Greenhorn, Shannon, J-Sand, and
D-Sand. As of September 30, 2016, we held approximately 11,556 net
D-J Basin acres located in Weld County, Colorado through our
wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC
(  Red
Hawk  ), which asset we refer to as our
  D-J Basin
Asset.   As of September 30, 2016, we hold interests in
61 gross (17.4 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 14 gross
(12.5 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and currently producing,
25 gross (4.9 net) wells are non-operated and 22 wells have an
after-payout interest. 

We believe that the D-J Basin shale play represents among the most
promising unconventional oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We
plan to continue to opportunistically seek additional acreage
proximate to our currently held acreage. Our strategy is to be the
operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures,
in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate the pace of
development in order to execute our business
plan.   

2 

We have
listed below the total production volumes and total
revenue net to the Company for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 attributable to our D-J Basin Asset,
including the calculated production volumes and revenue numbers for
our D-J Basin Asset held indirectly through Condor that would be
net to our interest if reported on a consolidated basis and
production realized from our recent D-J Basin Acquisition beginning
February 23, 2015 (described in greater detail below in
  D-J Basin Asset
Acquisition  ). 

(1)
Assumes 6 Mcf of natural gas is equivalent to 1 barrel of
oil. 

Strategy 

The
majority of our capital expenditure budget for the next twelve
months will be focused on the development of our D-J Basin Asset.
Our development plan calls for the development of approximately
$35.6 million in capital expenditures (of which $5.1 million has
been deployed to acquire interests in 2.1 net short lateral wells
already in 2016) in order to drill and complete, participate in the
drilling and completion of, and/or acquire approximately 8.5 net
wells in our D-J Basin Asset for the next twelve months. We plan to
fund our operations and business plan by utilizing projected cash
flow from operations, a $26 million debt facility we closed in
May 2016, our cash on hand and proceeds from future potential debt
and/or equity financings, which may include drilling partnerships.
In addition, we may seek additional funding through asset sales,
farm-out arrangements, lines of credit, or public or private debt
or equity financings to fund additional 2016-2017 capital
expenditures and/or repay or refinance a portion or all of our
outstanding debt. If market conditions are not conducive to
raising additional funds, the Company may choose to extend the
drilling program and associated capital expenditures further
into 2017. 

Recent Developments 

GOM Merger  

On
February 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the
  Amendment  ) with White
Hawk Energy, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
(  White
Hawk  ), and GOM Holdings, LLC (  GOM  ), which amends that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization entered
into by and among the Company, White Hawk and GOM on December 29,
2015 (the   GOM
Merger Agreement  ). In order to provide GOM additional
time to meet certain closing conditions contemplated by
the GOM Merger Agreement, the parties entered into the Amendment to
extend the deadline for closing the merger and the date after which
either party could terminate the GOM Merger Agreement if the merger
had not yet been consummated, from February 29, 2016 to no later
than April 15, 2016. 

On
April 25, 2016, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to the
GOM Merger Agreement (the   Amendment No. 2  ) with
White Hawk and GOM, which further amends the GOM Merger Agreement
in order to provide GOM additional time to meet certain
closing conditions contemplated by the GOM Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Amendment No. 2, the parties agreed to remove the
deadline for closing the merger and work expeditiously in good
faith toward closing. 

3 

In
order for the Company to move forward with the GOM Merger, it is
requiring that GOM improve its financial position, including pay
off certain amounts of its accounts payable. On October 19, 2016,
GOM notified the Company that it had received funding of
approximately $7.5 million that has been deposited into an escrow
account and that will be used to pay down its accounts
payable once certain funding requirements have been met by GOM. The
Company is encouraged by this news as it is a requisite step
necessary for closing. The Company and GOM continue to move forward
with the merger, which the Company is working to close as soon as
possible, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions including
possible approval by applicable
bankruptcy courts. 

At-The-Market Offering 

On September 29, 2016, the Company entered into an At Market
Issuance Sales Agreement (the    Sales
Agreement   ) with National
Securities Corporation (   NSC   ), a wholly owned subsidiary of
National Holdings Corporation (NasdaqCM:NHLD), pursuant to
which the Company may issue and sell shares of its common stock,
having an aggregate offering price of up to $2,000,000 (the
   Shares   )
from time to time, as the Company deems prudent, through NSC (the
   Offering   ).
Also, on September 29, 2016, the Company filed a prospectus
supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with the Offering (the   Prospectus Supplement  )
under its existing shelf registration statement, which became
effective on November 5, 2013 (File No. 333-191869). Upon
delivery of a placement notice and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Sales Agreement, NSC may sell the Shares by
methods deemed to be an  at the market offering  as
defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, including
sales made directly on or through the NYSE MKT, on any other
existing trading market for the Company s common stock or
sales made to or through a market maker. With the Company s
prior written approval, NSC may also sell the Shares by any other
method permitted by law, including in negotiated transactions. The
Company may elect not to issue and sell any Shares in the Offering
and the Company or NSC may suspend or terminate the offering of
Shares upon notice to the other party and subject to other
conditions. NSC will act as sales agent on a commercially
reasonable efforts basis consistent with its normal trading and
sales practices and applicable state and federal law, rules and
regulations and the rules of the NYSE MKT. The Company has agreed
to pay NSC commissions for its services in acting as agent in the
sale of the Shares in the amount equal to 3.0% of the gross sales
price of all Shares sold pursuant to the Agreement. The Company
also agreed to pay various expenses in connection with the
offering, including reimbursing up to $30,000 of NSC s legal
fees, which is to be paid in three (3) installments as follows: (a)
$10,000 on the date of the parties  entry into the Sales
Agreement, (b) $10,000 on the date that is thirty (30) days from
the date of the Sales Agreement, and (c) the balance due (not to
exceed $10,000) on the date that is sixty (60) days from the date
of the Sales Agreement. The Company has also agreed to provide NSC
with customary indemnification and contribution rights. The Company
intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, if any, to fund
development and for working capital and general corporate purposes,
including general and administrative purposes. The Company is not
obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales
Agreement, and no assurance can be given that the Company will sell
any shares under the Sales Agreement, or, if it does, as to the
price or amount of Shares that it will sell, or the dates on which
any such sales will take place. As of the date of this filing, the
Company has issued and sold no shares in the
Offering.  

Critical Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. We believe there have been no
significant changes in our critical accounting policies as
discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $100,000 was
primarily due to a small decline in production from our oil and gas
assets (this decline was a result of the natural decline in
production from these wells).   

Lease Operating Expenses.  For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, lease operating expenses associated with our
oil and gas properties were $512,000, compared to $495,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
$17,000. 

Exploration Expense.  For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, exploration expense was $14,000, compared
to $165,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease of $151,000 was primarily due to less exploration activity
undertaken by the Company in the current period due to price
volatility in the oil markets and capital constraints. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . For the three
months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and
administrative ( SG A ) expenses were $597,000,
compared to $1,389,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease of $792,000 was primarily due to decreases in
stock compensation expense, as well as payroll, as shown in the
table below. The components of SG A expenses are summarized
below (amounts in thousands): 

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization and Accretion
( DD A ) . For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, DD A costs were $521,000, compared to
$1,072,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
$551,000 decrease was primarily the result of lower depletion rates
after receiving an updated reserve report on June 1, 2016
(which included additional reserves acquired with the interests in
eight (8) non-operated wells re-acquired from Dome Energy in March
2016), and lower production volumes due to a natural decline in
well production. 

Total Other Expense.  For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, total other expense was $3,088,000, compared to
$3,656,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease in total other expense was primarily due to a decrease in
amortized debt discount included in interest expense during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior
year s period, offset slightly by the increase in monthly
interest due as the principal balance of the debt
increased. 

Net Loss Attributable to PEDEVCO Common
Stockholders.  For the three months ended September 30,
2016, net loss attributable to PEDEVCO common stockholders was
$3,514,000, compared to a net loss attributable to PEDEVCO common
stockholders of $5,455,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease in net loss of $1,941,000 was primarily due to
lower SG A expenses, lower DD A, and a decrease in interest
expenses (as described above). 

5 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 with the
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Oil and Gas Revenue.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we generated a total of $3,003,000 in revenues
from the sale of oil and gas, compared to $4,593,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $1,590,000 was
primarily due to a decline in production from our oil and gas
assets and a reduction in crude oil prices. This volume decline was
a result of a natural decline in well production, periodic wells
being shut-in and the Loomis wells being put on line in December
2014 which yielded higher production in the nine months ending
September 30, 2015 relative to the their production in 2016 (due to
the natural decline in production from these wells). 

Lease Operating Expenses.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, lease operating expenses associated with our
oil and gas properties were $1,190,000, compared to $1,434,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of
$244,000 was primarily due to lower variable lease operating
expenses associated with the lower volume resulting from the
natural decline in well production and periodic wells being
shut-in. 

Exploration Expense.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, exploration expense was $217,000, compared
to $693,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease of $476,000 was primarily due to less exploration activity
undertaken by the Company in the current period due to price
volatility in the oil markets and capital
constraints.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, SG A expenses were $3,318,000,
compared to $5,672,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease of $2,354,000 was primarily due to a decrease in
stock compensation expense, as well as cost reductions in various
other areas as shown in the table below. The components of SG A
expenses are summarized below (amounts in thousands): 

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties . For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, impairment of oil and gas properties was
$-0-, compared to $1,337,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. All of our unproved leasehold property was impaired in
2015 as a result of a change in drilling plans. 

Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and
Accretion . For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, DD A costs were $2,320,000, compared to $3,379,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was
primarily the result of lower depletion rates after receiving an
updated reserve report on June 1, 2016 (which included additional
reserves acquired with the interests in eight (8) non-operated
wells re-acquired from Dome Energy in March 2016), and lower
production volumes due to a natural decline in well
production. 

Gain on Settlement of Payables.  For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, gain on settlement of payables was
$1,282,000 compared to a gain of $-0- for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The gain in 2016 was related to a
Settlement Agreement entered into with Liberty for vendor
obligations that was recorded in the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

6 

Gain on Sale of Oil and Gas Properties.  For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, gain on sale of oil and gas
properties was $-0- compared to a gain on sale of oil and gas
properties of $275,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The gain in 2015 was related to a Settlement Agreement
entered into with MIE Jurassic Energy Corporation
( MIEJ ) that was recorded in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Gain on Sale of Equity Investment.  For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the gain on sale of equity investment was
$-0- compared to a gain of $566,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The gain in 2015 was related to a Settlement
Agreement entered into with MIEJ that was recorded in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Gain from Equity Method Investments.  For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we had no gain or loss from equity
method investments compared to a loss from equity method
investments of $91,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, due to the Settlement Agreement entered into with
MIEJ that was recorded in the nine months ended September 30,
2015. There is no longer an equity method investment. 

Total Other Income (Expense).  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, total other expense was $10,766,000, compared
to $7,913,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in total other expense was primarily due to the one-time
gain on debt extinguishment of $2,192,000 related to the Settlement
Agreement in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, offset by
$621,000 of additional interest expense incurred during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year s
period (due to an increase in the principal balance of the
debt). 

Net Loss Attributable to PEDEVCO Common
Stockholders.  For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net loss attributable to PEDEVCO common stockholders was
$13,526,000, compared to a net loss attributable to PEDEVCO common
stockholders of $15,081,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease in net loss of $1,555,000 was primarily due to
lower operating expenses as described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In
order to sustain and further develop the Company s business
plan, management determined that (1) it required funding for
acquisitions of strategic properties and to execute its drilling
plans and (2) its existing debt would be required to be
restructured to provide additional time for the Company to pursue
accretive acquisitions and oil field development in order to grow
the Company and provide the operating cash flows to fully repay its
debts. Accordingly, in May 2016, we entered into a new debt
facility of approximately $25 million to be used solely to fund
drilling and completion costs, and also deferred principal and
interest payments of an aggregate of approximately $39 million from
short-term to long-term liabilities. In connection with the new
debt facility (described in Note 8 to the financial statements
included above), all Net Revenue produced each month over and above
a $150,000 G A budget is used for debt repayment.  Net
Revenue  is defined as all oil and gas revenue received by
the Company and its subsidiaries  less  (i) lease operating expenses
(which include all expenses chargeable to joint interest billing
accounts under applicable joint operating agreements,
transportation and processing charges, land owner royalties, ad
valorem and severance taxes, and reasonable lease and well-related
title, legal, accounting and other professional fees), (ii)
interest payments due to the lenders under the new debt facility,
payment of which shall not commence until February 2108, (iii)
general and administrative expenses not to exceed $150,000 per
month unless preapproved in writing by the Agent, and (iv)
extraordinary expenses that are preapproved in writing. This
monthly sweep will use most of the cash generated by our assets,
thereby limiting cash generated from our operations for use toward
future development and general and administrative
expenses. 

The
Company made an initial draw under the new debt facility of
approximately $6.4 million to acquire interests in 8 wells located
in the Wattenberg Area of Weld County, Colorado and to pay
transaction-related closing costs, accrued interest, and
outstanding accounts payable. The Company has access to up to an
additional $18.5 million of debt capital available under the new
debt facility and notes issued thereunder to fund its drilling and
development plans, including approximately 8.5 net wells in our D-J
Basin Asset during the period from January 2016 to December 2016
(of which interests in 2.1 net short lateral wells have been
acquired already in 2016), which additional draws are available in
the lenders  sole discretion. 

To
complete the remainder of the $35.6 million planned acquisition and
drilling plan (of which $5.1 million has been deployed to acquire
interests in 2.1 net short lateral wells already in 2016), the
Company will be required to raise an additional $11-12 million from
additional sources. There is no assurance that such funds will be
available on favorable terms, if at all. If such funds are not
available, we plan to use the remaining proceeds under the new debt
facility to complete as much of the acquisition and drilling plan
as possible and extend the drilling program and associated capital
expenditures into 2017. 

7 

The
Company implemented a cost reduction plan in April 2016 that
reduced our general and administrative costs to the $150,000
budgeted amount as required under the new debt facility, primarily
through work force reductions and lower professional
fees. 

The
Company maintains additional sources of liquidity including
$692,000 of cash on-hand, and existing receivables of
$537,000. 

As a
part of the anticipated GOM Merger, we expect to have additional
financial resources and plan to further restructure our existing
debt obligations to fund the Company s drilling
plans. 

As of
December 31, 2015, the Company had a working capital deficit of
$5.6 million. Following completion of the new debt facility, we
settled a $2,620,000 payable for $750,000; and $4.95 million
borrowed as part of the transaction was used to reduce other
accrued liabilities. In addition, $588,000 of short-term debt was
subordinated to the senior lender and cannot be paid until the
senior lender is repaid. As a result, our working capital deficit
as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.7
million that includes revenue held in suspense, unpaid employee
vacation, estimated 2017 taxes, PIK interest, principal and other
payables that when due and payable should be covered by our $1.4
million in current assets. 

Our
future liquidity is limited to the amounts available after the
monthly Net Revenue Sweep until such debt is repaid or the terms
are modified for alternate payment arrangements. We anticipate that
our planned drilling and development activities will provide
sufficient cash flow to repay the debt at which time we will no
longer be subject to the Monthly Sweep. Availability of the
remaining funds under the new debt facility are subject to the
discretion of the lender and our results from initial drilling
activities. 

We
acknowledge that adequate funds may not be available when needed or
may not be available on favorable terms. If we need to raise funds
in the future by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing
shareholders will result, and such securities may have rights,
preferences, and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If
funding is insufficient at any time in the future and we are unable
to generate sufficient revenue from new business arrangements, to
complete planned acquisitions or operations, our results of
operations and the value of our securities could be adversely
affected. 

Financial Summary 

We had
total current assets of $1.4 million as of September 30, 2016,
including cash of $0.7 million, compared to total current assets of
$1.9 million as of December 31, 2015, including a cash balance of
$1.1 million. 

We had
total assets of $61.6 million as of September 30, 2016 compared to
$60.8 million as of December 31, 2015. Included in total assets as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were $60.1 million and
$58.8 million, respectively, of proved oil and gas properties
subject to amortization and $-0- and $-0-, respectively, of
unproved oil and gas properties not subject to
amortization. 

We had
total liabilities of $57.6 million as of September 30, 2016,
including current liabilities of $3.1 million,
compared to total liabilities of $45.7 million as of December 31,
2015, including current liabilities of $7.6 million. 

We
had negative working capital of $1.7 million,
total shareholders  equity of $4.0 million and a total
accumulated deficit of $95.6 million as of September 30, 2016,
compared to negative working capital of $5.6 million, total
shareholders  equity of $15.0 million and a total accumulated
deficit of $82.1 million as of December 31, 2015. 

Cash Flows From Operating Activities.  We had net cash
used in operating activities of $6,094,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, which was a decrease in cash used of
$1,382,000 compared to the prior year s period net cash used
of $7,476,000. This decrease was primarily due to a lower net
loss. 

8 

Cash Flows From Investing Activities.  We had net
cash used in investing activities of $74,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, which was a decrease in cash available of
$431,000 compared to $357,000 of net cash provided by investing
activities for the prior year s period. This change was
primarily due to proceeds from the sale of an equity investment in
the prior year during the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

Cash Flows From Financing Activities.  We had net cash
provided by financing activities of $5,722,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, which was an increase of $3,905,000
compared to $1,817,000 of net cash provided by financing activities
for the prior year s period. This change was primarily a
result of the proceeds from notes payable in the current
period. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  In April
2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of
Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs. ASU 2015-03 amends previous guidance to require
that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt
discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt
issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The
standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The affected amounts shown on the
Company s balance sheet were a result of reclassifications
within the balance sheet upon adoption of this ASU to conform to
this standard. The Company adopted this ASU during the first
quarter of 2016 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a
material impact on its financial statements (balance sheet amounts
as of December 31, 2015 were also reclassified for comparability
purposes). 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

Pursuant
to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (  229.305(e)), the Company
is not required to provide the information required by this Item as
it is a   smaller
reporting company,   as defined by Rule
229.10(f)(1). 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the   Exchange Act  ) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
period specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, as
appropriate, in order to allow timely decisions in connection with
required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded as of September 30, 2016, that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting, including any
corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Although
we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims
arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we
are not currently a party to any material legal proceeding. In
addition, we are not aware of any material legal or governmental
proceedings against us, or contemplated to be brought against
us. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors previously
disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Commission on March
29, 2016, other than as described below, and investors are
encouraged to review such risk factors in the Form 10-K, prior to
making an investment in the Company. 

We are required to complete a reverse stock split of our issued and
outstanding common stock prior to May 3, 2017, in order to continue
to trade our common stock on the NYSE MKT. 

On November 3, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE MKT that our
common stock had been selling for a low price per share (i.e.,
under $0.20 per share), for a substantial period of time, and that
our continued listing on the NYSE MKT was predicated on us
completing a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding
common stock by May 3, 2017. Pursuant to the rules of the NYSE MKT,
if an issuer s common stock sells at what the NYSE MKT
considers a  low selling price  (generally trading
below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time) and the
issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split after notification
by the NYSE MKT (provided that issuers can also be delisted if any
shares of the issuer trade below $0.06 per share), the NYSE MKT may
delist the securities of such issuer. The NYSE MKT also advised us
that we were  below compliance  with applicable NYSE
MKT listing standards due to the low trading price of our common
stock and that a  .BC  indicator would be affixed to
our trading symbol until such time as we regained compliance with
the NYSE MKT s listing standards. In the event we fail to
receive stockholder approval for a reverse stock split at our 2016
annual meeting of stockholders which will take place on December
28, 2016, or any meeting convened thereafter, and/or in the event
we fail to effect a reverse stock split by May 3, 2017, the NYSE
MKT may delist our common stock. If the NYSE MKT delists our common
stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including,
but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities,
reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities,
and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our
operations. In addition, delisting from the NYSE MKT might
negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our
business. Finally, if we were delisted from the NYSE MKT and are
not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we
will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 registration statements,
which may delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit
the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and could
increase the expenses of any offering. 

The closing of the GOM merger is subject to various risks and
closing conditions and such planned transaction may not occur on a
timely basis, if at all. 

The
GOM merger is subject to various closing conditions as set forth in
greater detail in the GOM Merger Agreement. Additionally, the
Company is aware that the parent company of GOM has experienced
significant liquidity problems, is currently under investigation by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice
Department, is currently taking steps to liquidate its assets,
including the assets subject to the GOM merger, has filed for
Bankruptcy protection, and certain of its assets are also subject
to separate Bankruptcy proceedings initiated by certain creditors.
Any one of these circumstances may delay the closing of the GOM
merger or prevent certain closing conditions associated therewith
from occurring, which in turn could prevent the merger from
closing.
