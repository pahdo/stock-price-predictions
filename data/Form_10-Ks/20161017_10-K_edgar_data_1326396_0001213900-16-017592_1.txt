Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements    

This
report contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions
made by and information currently available to us. Such statements should not be unduly relied upon. Forward-looking statements
include statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not
historical facts or that are not present facts or conditions. Forward-looking statements and information can generally be identified
by the use of forward-looking terminology or words, such as  anticipate,   approximately,   believe, 
 continue,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   intend,   may, 
 ongoing,   pending,   perceive,   plan,   potential,   predict, 
 project,   seeks,   should,   views  or similar words or phrases or variations
thereon, or the negatives of those words or phrases, or statements that events, conditions or results  can,   will, 
 may,   must,   would,   could  or  should  occur or be achieved and
similar expressions in connection with any discussion, expectation or projection of future operating or financial performance,
costs, regulations, events or trends. The absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.  

Forward-looking
statements and information are based on management s current expectations and assumptions, which are inherently subject
to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. These statements reflect our current view
concerning future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. There are important factors that could cause
actual results to vary materially from those described in this report as anticipated, estimated or expected, including, but not
limited to, those factors and conditions described under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  as well as general conditions in
the economy, petrochemicals industry and capital markets, Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC  ) regulations
which affect trading in the securities of  penny stocks,  and other risks and uncertainties. Except as required by
law, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
Depending on the market for our stock and other conditional tests, a specific safe harbor under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 may be available. Notwithstanding the above, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Securities
Act  ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange Act  ), expressly
state that the safe harbor for forward-looking statements does not apply to companies that issue penny stock. Because we may from
time to time be considered to be an issuer of penny stock, the safe harbor for forward-looking statements may not apply to us
at certain times.

PART
I  

ITEM
1. BUSINESS.  

GENERAL
OVERVIEW  

(a)  
       Nature of business    

We, through our PRC operating subsidiaries,
Ningbo Keyuan, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers ,
Guangxi Keyuan and Zhongkexuneng, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of petrochemical products and rubber in the PRC. Our
operations include:  

(1)    A
                                         production facility with an annual petrochemical production capacity of 720,000 metric
                                         tons (  MT  ) of a variety of petrochemical products;   

(2)    A
                                         Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (  SBS  ) production facility with a designed
                                         annual production capacity of 70,000 MT;   

(3)    A
                                         Styrene-Ethylene-Butylene-Styrene (  SEBS  ) production facility with
                                         a designed annual production capacity of 10,000 MT;   

(4)    Facilities
                                         for the storage and loading of raw materials and finished petrochemical and rubber goods;
                                         and   

(5)  
      Manufacturing technologies that can support our manufacturing
process with relatively low raw material costs and high utilization and yields.   

In
January 2012, we signed a cooperation agreement with Fangchenggang City to build a new petrochemicals production facility in Guangxi
Keyuan New Materials Industrial Park, Guangxi Province (the   Guangxi Project  ). The estimated cost for the
Guangxi Project is approximately $300 million. According to the cooperation agreement, the local government of Fangchenggang
City agreed to grant land use rights for the facility.  

On
August 9, 2013, the Guangxi Project was approved by the local government of Fangchengang City. We were granted a land use
right for 40 years for approximately 4,668,437 square feet of land, effective in 2014. In August 2013, we commenced engineering
and facility construction. The preliminary investigation for foundation piling was completed in late October 2013. We completed
the land leveling and finished the installation of waterpipes, electricity wires and basic pipelines at the end of 2014. We completed
the technical design of the facility and the equipment at the end of 2015. We are currently arranging the tendering on the construction
of the facility and major equipment. We expect to finish construction of the facility and installation of main equipment and pipelines
by the end of 2017 and commence production by the end of 2018.  

We
believe that the Guangxi Project, as a part of our expansion plan, once it goes into operation, will improve our competitive positions
by extending and expanding our supply chain and manufacturing base. The facility is expected to have an annual production capacity
of 50,000 MT of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (  ABS  ). We plan to fund the construction and operation of
the Guangxi Project through outside financing. If such financing is not available on terms acceptable to us, the project will
be delayed until appropriate financing is available. As a result, the timelines for the Guangxi Project described above are subject
to adjustment pending the status of outside financing.  

(b)  
       Organization    

Keyuan
Petrochemicals, Inc. (formerly known as  Silver Pearl Enterprises, Inc. ) was incorporated in the State of Texas on
May 4, 2004 and redomiciled to Nevada on February 28, 2007.  

On
April 22, 2010, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the   Exchange Agreement  ) with Sinotech Group,
Delight Reward Limited (  Delight Reward  ), a British Virgin Islands company and sole stockholder of
Sinotech Group, and Denise D. Smith, our former principal stockholder. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Delight
Reward transferred to us all of its shares of Sinotech Group in exchange for 47,658 shares of our Series M convertible preferred
stock (the   Share Exchange  ). On an  as converted  basis, the Series M convertible preferred stock
represented approximately 95% of our outstanding common stock immediately after the Share Exchange. The Series M convertible preferred
stock voted with the common stock on an  as converted basis  and was converted into 47,658,000 shares of our common
stock on December 28, 2010.  

As
a result of the Share Exchange, Sinotech Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and Delight Reward became our controlling
stockholder. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization whereby Sinotech Group was deemed
to be the accounting acquirer (and the legal acquiree).  

On
May 12, 2010, we formed a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada called Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc. as our wholly-owned
subsidiary (the   Merger Subsidiary  ). Effective as of May 17, 2010, the Merger Subsidiary was merged with and
into us. As a result of the merger, our name was changed to  Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc.  Prior to the merger, the
Merger Subsidiary had no liabilities and nominal assets and, as a result of the merger, the separate existence of the merger subsidiary
ceased. We are the surviving corporation in the merger except for the name change, and there was no change in our directors,
officers, capital structure or business.  

On
August 8, 2010, we established a wholly owned subsidiary in China, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, through our subsidiary Keyuan
HK. Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals was initially set up to engage in the sales and marketing for products produced by Ningbo Keyuan
and, later, by Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers. However, in fact, Ningbo Keyuan and Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers have been selling their
products directly and Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals has mostly assisted each subsidiary in training and recruiting sale persons
as well as organizing marketing events.  

On
April 4, 2012, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary, Guangxi Keyuan, was formed for the purpose of developing the Guangxi Project.  

On
June 15, 2012, Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers was established as a wholly-owned PRC subsidiary of Ningbo Keyuan to engage in the
production and sales of SBS and SEBS.  

On
May 13, 2014, Zhongkexuneng was incorporated by Sinotech Group which owns 75% of Zhongkexuneng and Ningbo Keyuan which owns 25%
of Zhongkexuneng in Zhejiang province, China. Zhongkexuneng was formed for the purpose of trading petrochemical products.  

On September 16, 2015, Ningbo Keyuan and
Sinotech Group entered into an investment cooperation agreement with Ningbo Hengyun Energy Technology Co., Ltd (  Hengyun
Energy  ) (the   Investment Cooperation Agreement  ), pursuant to which Sinotech Group agreed to transfer
32.88% of its equity interest in Guangxi Keyuan to Hengyun Energy subject to a payment of consideration of RMB 198,284,300 by
Hengyun Energy (approximately $30.5 million) to be made by December 31, 2016. As the date of this report, Hengyun Energy has paid
RMB 1,380,000 (approximately $0.2 million). 

The current shareholding structure of the
Company is illustrated in the following diagram. The diagram is presented as if Hengyun Energy has already made full payment under
the Investment Cooperation Agreement: 

(c)  
       Events during the Last Three Years    

1.      Stock
                                         Repurchase Program.     

On
September 17, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $2 million of our shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share (the   Common Stock  ) for up to $1.50 per share. On December 31, 2012, we engaged TriPoint Global
Equities LLC (  TriPoint Global  ) as our agent to design and execute the stock repurchase program in compliance
with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. In July 2014, we terminated the stock repurchase
program after we purchased an aggregate of 425,110 shares of Common Stock. The following is a chart that provides details
of the repurchases that we made.  

2.      Settlement
                                         with the SEC.      

On
July 2, 2013, the United District Court for the District of Columbia issued a final judgment approving a settlement between us
and the SEC. The settlement was reached on February 28, 2013 in a case filed by the SEC in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia against us, alleging that we have violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act which
relate to making untrue statement or omitting a material fact resulting in misleading information during the sale of securities
or a fraud or deceit upon purchasers. Sections 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 and Rule 12-20 thereunder which require,
among other things, an issuer to timely file its periodic reports and other reports under the Exchange Act; and, Section 13(b)(2)(A)
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act which relate to the requirements of making and keeping books, record and accounts in reasonable
details and accuracy, and maintaining an internal accounting control system to provide reasonable assurances to accurate financial
statements. Under the terms of the settlement, we, did not admit or deny the allegation of the complaint, paid a civil penalty
of US$1 million and were permanently enjoined from violating certain securities laws.  

3.      Settlement
                                         of the Class Action and the Derivative Action.      

On
February 13, 2014, the Brown Law Firm filed a derivative action suit (the   Derivative Action  ) on behalf of
the Company alleging certain and former current officers and directors of the Company had violated their fiduciary duties during
the period from at least April 22, 2010 to October 20, 2011. The Company and the plaintiff entered certain settlement of the Derivative
Action pursuant to the terms of a stipulation of settlement whereby we agreed to certain corporate governance reforms including
expanding our nomination and corporate governance committee and adopting a related party transaction policy and an payment of
$190,000 to plaintiff s counsel. On October 5, 2015, United States District Court Southern District of New York entered
an order granting final approval of the settlement. The Derivative Action was dismissed.  

On
November 15, 2011, the Rosen Law Firm filed a class action suit (the   Class Action  ) on behalf of certain stockholders,
alleging the Company had violated federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading statements and omitting material
facts with regard to disclosure of related party transactions and effectiveness of internal controls in past public filings. After
litigating the case for several years, the parties entered a stipulation of settlement in the aggregate amount of $2,650,000 in
cash, plus interests, the terms of which United States District Court Southern District of New York entered an order granting
final approval of on October 9, 2015. The Class Action was dismissed.  

4.      Settlement
                                         with the holder of Series B preferred shares and Side Agreement with Majority Stockholder.

On
October 28, 2014, Dragon State, an investor in our September 2010 Private Placement (as defined below), filed a
complaint against, among others, the Company and Mr. Chunfeng Tao (  Tao  ), seeking rescission of the
securities purchase agreement in the September 2010 Private Placement (as defined below) and the return of $20 million, and
in the alternative, seeking monetary damages to be determined at  trial but not less than $20 million (the
  Complaint  ). At the closing of the September 2010 Private Placement, Dragon State purchased from us for
an aggregate price of $20 million, 5,333,340 shares of our Series B preferred stock, 800,001 series C warrants to purchase
800,001 common shares, at a price of $4.50 per share (subject to adjustments), and 800,001 series D warrants to purchase
800,001 common shares at a price of $5.25 per share (subject to adjustments).  

On
July 11, 2016, we entered into a share purchase and settlement agreement (the   Settlement Agreement  )
with Dragon State, Delight Reward, Keyuan HK, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Ningbo Keyuan, and Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers (the
Company, Keyuan HK, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Ningbo Keyuan and Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers are collectively referred as the
  Keyuan Group  ), Tao, and Prax Capital Equity Management Co., Ltd., an affiliated party to Dragon State.
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Dragon State agreed to transfer the securities purchased in the September 2010 Private
Placement to Delight Reward for a consideration of RMB 12,000,000 or the equivalent in US dollars at an interbank RMB/U.S.
dollar exchange rate published by the People s Bank of China on July 11, 2016 (the   PBOC FX Rate  ).
In addition, Delight Reward and Keyuan Group agreed to pay, and Dragon State agreed to accept, a settlement of RMB 6,000,000
or equivalent US dollars at the PBOX FX Rate to waive all claims and liabilities that Dragon State or its affiliated
companies or individuals had brought or would bring against Delight Reward, Keyuan Group, Tao and their affiliates including
the Complaint. These amounts were paid on July 15, 2016. On July 19, 2016, the United States District Court Southern District
of New York entered an order granting final approval of the settlement. The Complaint was dismissed.  

On
August 4, 2016, Delight Reward entered into a side agreement with the Company (the   Side Agreement  ).
Under the Side Agreement, Delight Reward agreed not to claim, that the warrants transferred pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement were exercisable, and agreed to pay  us for each convertible share underlying the Series B preferred stock
transferred pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the highest sale price of the Company s Common Stock per share as
reported on the OTC Pink during a period commencing on the date of the Settlement Agreement and ending on August 4, 2016,
which was $0.005 per share of Common Stock. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock underlying the series
B preferred stock was therefore $27,465.01. On August 8, 2016, these funds were paid in cash by Delight Reward. On
August 10, 2016, the shares of Series B preferred stock were converted into 5,493,001 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of the certificate of designation of series B preferred stock and the Side Agreement.  

5.      Production
                                         Suspension.     

During the second
quarter of 2013, we conducted routine maintenance of our entire production facilities and suspended production for 41 days. This
routine maintenance is standard and necessary in the petrochemical production industry and is undertaken every two years, depending
on the condition of the facilities. As a result of the suspension, our total production for fiscal year 2013 decreased by approximately
98,000 MT and revenue decreased by approximately $110 million compared to fiscal year 2012. 

During the fiscal year 2015, we suspended production
for 85 days. On January 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a temporary suspension of operations of Ningbo Keyuan and Keyuan
Synthetic Rubbers. The decision was made in connection with the continuingly depressed oil price in international markets occurring
in June 2014 which materially negatively impacted us and our downstream distributors. As a result, we then did not have enough
capital to maintain operations during the suspension, but we performed routine maintenance of our facilities during such time.
We resumed operation in April 2015 when we observed the recovery and stabilization of international oil prices. 

As a result of the suspension, our total production
of finished products for the fiscal year 2015 decreased by approximately 71,000 MT and revenue for the fiscal year 2015 decreased
by approximately $179 million compared to the total production of finished products and revenue for the fiscal year 2014, respectively. 

(d)  
       Other Historical Events    

In April and May, 2010, we offered and sold
to an aggregate of 122 accredited investors 748,704 units of securities at a purchase price of $35 per unit, for a total
gross proceed of $26,204,640, consisting of, in the aggregate, (a) 6,738,336 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock,
par value $0.001 per share, convertible into the same number of shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustments), (b) 748,704 shares
of Common Stock, (c) 748,704 three-year Series A warrants to purchase up to 748,704 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price
of $4.50 per share (subject to adjustments), and (d) 748,704 three-year Series B warrants to purchase up to 748,704 shares of Common
Stock, at an exercise price of $5.25 per share (subject to adjustments) (the   April-May 2010 Private Placement  ).
The units were issued in accordance with the exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act. (Subsequent litigation
relating to this private placement is described above.) 

O n
September 28, 2010, we closed a private placement, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20,250,000, of a total of 540,001 units of
securities at a purchase price of $37.50 per unit, each unit consisting of (a) 10 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock,
(b) 1 three year Series C warrant to purchase 1.5 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $4.50 per share (subject to
adjustments), and (c) 1 three year Series D warrant to purchase 1.5 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $5.25 per
share (subject to adjustments) (the   September 2010 Private Placement  ) in reliance upon the exemption from
the registration provisions of the Securities Act. (Subsequent litigation relating to this private placement is described above.)  

3.      Independent
                                         Investigation and NASDAQ Delisting.      

In connection with the preparation of our
annual report on Form 10-K for the year end ed
December 31, 2010, on or about March 24, 2011, KPMG, our former independent auditor, raised certain issues primarily relating
to certain cash transactions and recorded sales and requested that our Audit Committee conduct an independent investigation. Based
on the issues raised by KPMG, on March 31, 2011, our Audit Committee elected to commence an independent investigation (the   Investigation  )
on the issues raised and engaged the services of independent counsel, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (  Pillsbury  ),
which in turn engaged Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP (  Deloitte  ), as independent forensic accountants,
and King   Wood Mallesons (  King   Wood  ), as Audit Committee counsel in China (Pillsbury, Deloitte
and King   Wood are collectively referred herein as the   Investigation Team  ). On September 28, 2011, the
Investigation Team completed the investigation.  

Prior
to the Investigation, our Common Stock was quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol  KEYP . On April 1,
2011, in connection with the commencement of the investigation, trading in our Common Stock was halted by Nasdaq Stock Market.
On October 3, 2011, we provided the Nasdaq Hearings Panel with a copy of the final investigation report along with a comprehensive
list of remedial actions we had taken and were committed to taking to remediate the accounting and internal control issues. On
October 5, 2011, we were notified that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel exercised its discretionary authority pursuant to NASDAQ Listing
Rule 5101 to delist our securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market. On October 7, 2011, our stock began trading on the OTC Pink under
the symbol  KEYP .  

OUR
PRODUCTS   

We
manufacture and supply a variety of petrochemical and rubber products, including petrochemical products such as Benzene Toluene-Xylene
Aromatics (  BTX Aromatics  ), propylene, styrene, liquid petroleum gas (  LPG  ), Methyl Tertiary
Butyl Ether (  MTBE  ) and rubber products such as SBS and SEBS, each of which is described below, and other
products.  

Petrochemical
Products  :  

BTX Aromatics : consisting of benzene, toluene,
xylene and other chemical components for further processing into plastics, gasoline and solvents materials widely used in paint,

similar to SBS but we believe with a more durable product feature.    

In
addition, we will start producing ABS once we complete the construction of the facility in Guangxi and the trail production.  

PRODUCTION
CAPACITY AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES   

Our annual designed manufacturing capacity
is 720,000 MT in the aggregate of these products. Our annual designed capacity for SBS production facility is  
to 70,000 MT and for SEBS production facility is  to 10,000 MT. Additionally, we have a total of 134,000 MT of storage capacity,
consisting of 84,000 MT of storage capacity for raw materials and 50,000 MT for finished products. We also own a dock in Ningbo,
China which can directly unload foreign cargo vessels under the 50,000 MT cargo capacity to our dock.  

In addition, the construction of an oil catalytic
cracking processing facility was completed by the end of 2014. It is used as an extension of our catalytic pyrolysis processing
equipment. This facility can reduce production costs and the market risk in the purchase of raw materials, and improve the
stability and efficiency of project production of heavy oil to 200,000 MT of heavy oil per year. 

Facilities
for Petrochemical Products    

(1)    We
                                         use industrial standard designed manufacturing capacity based on equipment and facility.
                                         In the case that a facility is operated efficiently, the actual production can exceed
                                         the designed manufacturing capacity.    

Facilities
for Advanced Petrochemical and Rubber Products    

(1)    Our
                                         SBS facility was completed in September 2011. It currently has two production lines in
                                         commercial production. SBS generally has a higher product margin compared to other petrochemical
                                         products we are producing and a wide range of applications in the footwear, adhesive,
                                         polymer modification and modified asphalt industries.    

(2)    Our
                                         SEBS facility started full production in fiscal year 2014.    

EXPANSION   

All
of our facilities, except for the SBS and SEBS facility, have been operating since 2009. Therefore, those older facilities generally
provide us with a stable output. While we are continuously working on existing equipment upgrades to increase production, we realize
that optimizing the utilization rates for our current facilities is currently not sufficient to meet increasing customer demands.
More specifically, increasing market demand for tire and auto parts has resulted in increasing market demand for styrene and ABS;
and higher requirements related to environmental protection imposed by the PRC government have led to greater demand for transformer
oil and catalytic cracking oil. Based on these market trends, we completed the construction of an oil catalytic cracking processing
facility by the end of 2014. And we are more recently focused on the following improvements to our infrastructure to expand our
manufacturing capacity:  

Constructing
                                         an ABS production facility in Guangxi Province. We completed the technical design of
                                         the facility and the equipment at the end of 2015. We are currently arranging the tendering
                                         on the construction of the facility and major equipment. We expect to finish construction
                                         of the facility and installation of main equipment and pipelines by the end of 2017 and
                                         commence production by the end of 2018 with an annual production capacity of 50,000 MT
                                         of ABS;    

Upgrading
                                         our facility for styrene to increase annual design capacity of ethylene-styrene
                                         from 80,000 MT to 200,000 MT, of which 120,000 MT can be used for producing synthetic
                                         materials and 80,000 MT can be sold to downstream petrochemical companies;   

Constructing
                                         a transformer oil facility using hydrogen from the ethylene-styrene facility so
                                         that we can complete a double hydrogenation process on original products (such as BTX
                                         Aromatic) for refining transformer oil and producing high value transformer oil with
                                         a design capability of 100,000 MT per year. Construction of the main facility column
                                         was completed at the end of October 2013. We are currently performing the assembly
                                         and installation and expect to start production by the end of March 2017; and    

Adding 50,000 MT of new storage capacity, after which our total storage capacity will be 150,000 MT. We completed
construction of two new tanks with approximately 34,000 MT of new storage in 2013 which became operational at the end of 2013 after
being approved by the local environmental department. The facility for the remaining 16,000 MT of new storage capacity is under
construction. We expect to complete the construction at the end of 2016 and start operation in early 2017.    

The
total estimated cost of our expansion plan is approximately $372.5 million, including $300 million for Guangxi Project, $30 million
for the transformer oil facility, $40 million for the increased annual design capacity of ethylene-styrene, and $2.5 million for
additional storage capacity. Upon completion of our expansion described above, our total production capacity is expected
to reach 1,270,000 MT per year comprised of our current petrochemical production of 720,000 MT, SBS of 70,000 MT, SEBS of 10,000
MT, additional styrene of 120,000 MT, catalytic cracking oil of 200,000 MT, ABS of 50,000 MT, and transformer oil of 100,000 MT.  

Our
current estimate of our expansion schedule is as follows. However, we are continuing our evaluation of timelines for our expansion
projects based on our financial situation and market conditions.  

(1)  
      The construction of the ABS facility and installation
of main equipment and pipelines is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 and production is expected to be started by the
end of 2018.   

PETROCHEMICAL
MARKET IN CHINA   

Based on a report of China Petroleum
and Chemical Federation, despite the declining growth in PRC economy and the drop in international crude oil price, the
petroleum and chemical industry is expected to maintain a stable growth in 2016 with the support from PRC government. The net
profit in the petroleum and chemical industry in 2015 was RMB 7 billion (approximately $1.12 
billion), a decrease of 18.3% compared to 2014. The turnover of the petroleum industry in 2015 was RMB 3.9 million
(approximately $0.6 million), a decrease of 20.5% compared to the turnover of RMB 4.9 million in 2014, and the turnover of
chemical industry in 2015 was RMB 8.8 billion (approximately $1.4 billion), an increase of 1.5% compared to the turnover of
RMB 8,709 million (approximately $1.4 billion) in 2014. ( data source:  http://www.askci.com/news/chanye/2016/02/14/1453914mc.shtml  )  

China s
increasing domestic demand for petrochemical and rubber products has exceeded the domestic supply in the past several years, and
as a result, China has imported petrochemical products to meet domestic demand, which is expected to continue for a number of
years. More specifically,  

ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AND SAFETY MEASURES   

We
are committed to environmental protection, facility safety and quality control throughout the design, maintenance and growth of
our operating facilities and manufacturing process.  

Environmental
Protection    

We
have taken various measures to meet national standards and ensure our environmental compliance. For example, we recycle the
water for cooling in our production process and large amounts of water can be saved through recycling. Sulfurated hydrogen
generated in production is sent to the facility for sulfur recovery. The waste water and waste gas is treated by our
sewage water treatment station and emissions control facility to meet the national standards before discharge. The industrial
residue and garbage is sent to qualified companies for safe treatment.  

Currently
we are in compliance with all environmental requirements and our facilities have passed inspections conducted by local environmental
departments.  

Safety
Measures    

We have not had any safety accidents since
the commencement of our operations except three accidents occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. In May 2014, during
an inspection of a solvent tower, a worker sent by the independent tower constructor accidently fell off the tower and drowned,
and one of our employees fell and drowned after attempting a rescue. In June 2014, during the maintenance of the dock, three workers
sent by an independent maintenance contractor commenced operations without pre-clearance with us and fell into the sea. Two were
rescued and one drowned. In September 2014, there was an explosion in a temporary storage tank during the installation of a new
pipeline causing one death and two injuries. These accidents caused a total loss of RMB 53 million (approximately $8.5 million).
Though these accidents were caused by the workers  failure to comply with the operational manual, we realized that we should
create a more comprehensive safety management system: 

(1)  
      Prior to the end of 2014, our general manager of operation
was also responsible for safety control. At the end of 2014, we hired a general manager in charge of safety control and management.
The safety general manager overrides any operational decision that is not in compliance with safety measures and requirements.
As of the date of this report, we have 15 employees in safety management and control department including 2 certified safety experts
and 3 registered safety control engineers;   

(2)  
      We make every September 20  a  safety alert
day  and organize safety training and seminars for all employees;   

(3)  
      In 2015, we
    improved our safety management system and incentivized operators and managers with monetary awards and penalties;   

(4)  
      We no longer operate during holidays and weekends except
for urgent repairs;   

(5)  
      We set up triple checking procedures of operators 
protection equipment to ensure the safety of operators; and   

(6)  
      Our managers and safety department employees examine the
facility every morning before commencing operation.   

Our
current safety control measures include:  

(1)
      
     A d istribution
control system;   

(2)
      
     An e mergency
shutdown mechanism;   

(3)
      
      An
    automatic     interlocking system;   

(4)
      
     A d etection
  alarm system for flammable and toxic gas;   

(5)
      
     A f ire
detection   automatic sprinkler system; and   

(6)
      
      A r eal-time
system and process monitoring system.   

We are currently in compliance with all governmental and
internal safety requirements and all of our facilities have passed the inspection conducted by local authorities. 

Quality
Control    

Our
petrochemical and rubber products have met all applicable national standards for petrochemical and rubber products set by the
General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the PRC.  

OUR
TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   

We
have proprietary manufacturing technologies.  

Specifically,
we possess the technology to use heavy oil as one of our raw materials, instead of naphtha which is a commonly used feedstock
in the petrochemical production industry. Heavy oil is approximately 15% cheaper per ton and more readily available than naphtha.  

In addition, we use enhanced technologies
in our production process so that we spend less and have greater efficiency. Our proprietary catalytic pyrolysis process uses
a set of dual risers for one precipitator and one regenerator, while the commonly used fluidized catalytic cracking process uses
one riser for one precipitator and one regenerator. The set of dual risers for one precipitator and one regenerator are integrated
into one complete process, which provides for ease of operation, higher operation efficiency and higher reaction temperature.
A catalytic pyrolysis process with high temperatures can generally produce more olefin hydrocarbon based products compared to
other equipment using low temperatures for the same products. 

Our
management consider our manufacturing technologies and manufacturing design important to our business, and have taken steps to
protect these technologies, including the following:  

In
                                         2011, we were granted a patent for our Multiple Ethylene Propylene (  MEP  )
                                         technology (#ZL-2010-2-0191523.6) by the National Intellectual Property Bureau in
                                         China. MEP is a technology used in our existing production process. We developed this
                                         proprietary production process that improves the manufacturing efficiency and flexibility
                                         for a wide range of petrochemical products and applies to a processing technology used
                                         in the production of ethylene and propylene. It allows us to use lower grade feedstock
                                         (such as heavy oil) instead of a higher grade feedstock commonly used in other existing
                                         petrochemical production processes, and thus improves the yield and utilization rate of the
                                         production line.    

In
                                         2013, we were granted a patent for  the synthetic method for transparent segmented
                                         copolymer  (#ZL-2012-1-0005678.9). This method is not only to expand the range
                                         of our SBS products, but also to increase the  K resin  content in styrene.    

In
                                         2014, we were granted two SEBS patents for Keyuan Synthetic Rubber: KYSEBS1310 and KYSEBS1320
                                         by National Intellectual Property Bureau in China.    

In
addition to patent protection, we have entered have confidentiality and license agreements with certain employees, customers and
others to protect the confidentiality of our technologies.  

OUR
LOCATION   

Our operation and storage facilities are
located in a port at the ocean-front and next to the East China Sea, which is in close proximity to suppliers and customers. We
believe that being located near a port provides us with the advantage of lower logistics cost and easier access to raw materials.
In addition, being located in Qingshi Industrial in Ningbo gives us convenient access to skilled labor and industry resources. 

We
own an on-site ocean shipping dock with 50,000 MT of shipping capacity and a 10-truck loading/unloading capacity. Approximately 90% of our
feedstock and finished products use this shipping dock. We are currently upgrading the classification of our own dock so that
we can unload foreign cargo vessels under the 50,000 MT cargo capacity to our dock directly. We expect that the upgrade will be
completed by the end of 2017 and we will be able to save additional logistics costs and storage fees once it is completed, as
we will be able to unload certain cargoes directly rather than paying a third party to do so.  

Our
Guangxi Project is located in Fangchengang city, an important port for Guangxi province, and other than Beihai, the only
major Chinese port on the Tonkin Gulf. The storage and logistics costs are generally lower in Fanchengang city compared to in
other ports in China.  

SALES
AND PRICING   

Sales    

Most
of our customers pay in advance to buy our products. To core customers with excellent credit history, we may grant credit sales,
which is part of our strategy to maintain customer relationships.  

In
order to meet customers  demands, we have improved our manufacturing technologies and streamlined our conversion process
to achieve an approximate 30 days  raw material-to-sales cycle.  

Pricing    

Our
raw material price fluctuations are primarily attributable to fluctuations of international oil prices and market changes of supply
and demand. We set our selling prices based upon benchmark prices published by national petrochemical companies, and/or through
individually negotiated prices with customers.  

CUSTOMERS   

Customers
for Petrochemicals Products    

Our
main customer base for petrochemicals products is downstream petrochemicals manufacturers who use our products as raw materials
for their own products such as polystyrene, isoprene, dicyclopentadiene, acrylic acid, oil fuel products and other chemical products
and distributors (trading companies) located in and near the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta who sell our products to
petrochemicals derivative companies and manufacturers.  

We
engage distributors as customers mainly because:  

(1)  
      Distributors customarily pay the entire purchase price
prior to shipment, while end-users often request credit payment terms; and   

(2)  
      Using distributors decreases our overhead by allowing
for a more streamlined sales force as distributors normally require less efforts in maintaining relationship and potentially order
more than individual companies. For instance, end-users often require more regular visits and a more highly specialized sales
team to work with.   

In
order to estimate the total orders for a year, we conduct surveys with our major customers to obtain their preliminary orders
for the next one or two years and update the information annually. We enter into purchase contracts with customers on an order-to-order
basis. In each order, price is determined based on market price and negotiation, and the quantity is specified based on (1) the
customer demand for a particular order and (2) our capability to satisfy that particular order.  

Our
five largest customers accounted for 33% and 27% of the sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We
anticipate that our overall customer composition and the concentration of our top customers will decrease as we expand our business
and modify our product portfolio to include new products and higher-margin products; however, we can give no assurance that this
will be the case.  

Customers
for SBS Products    

The
sales for SBS products commenced at the end of 2011. Our main customer base for SBS products is the trading agents located
in the Yangtze River delta, South China and Northern cities in China such as Hebei and Shangdong and end-user factories who purchase
our SBS as raw materials for their various products, such as shoe sole material, adhesive, waterproof rolling material, asphalt
and plastic modifier.  

We controlled
approximately 2.9% of the domestic SBS market in 2014. In 2015, our domestic SBS market share increased to 5.1%. ( data source:
 http://www.chem999.com  ) Our main SBS products, such as shoe sole material and asphalt modifier, were traded through
agents in 2015. We engage agents as our main customers primarily because:  

(1)  
      Trading agents pay 30% in advance when placing their
order and pay the rest before shipment, and   

(2)  
      Using trading agents decreases our overhead by allowing
for a more streamlined sales force, as trading agents do not require regular client visits or a highly specialized sales team
to maintain the relationships.   

To
maintain and develop our relationship with SBS customers, we set up a customer relationship department to closely monitor and
timely respond to customers  requests and feedback, as well as a technical team in charge of improving
product quality and adjusting product chemical features to meet different requirements from customers. We also developed a team
comprised of product managers, each of whom is responsible for one SBS product. They are given authority to work with the customer
relationship department, the factory and the agent, to offer a prompt solution to various needs.  

We
also have monthly meetings with our major SBS customers to obtain their preliminary orders. Because the price of SBS fluctuates
frequently and we do not have a warehouse distribution system, the price of SBS usually includes shipment cost.  

Customers
for SEBS Products    

Our SEBS facility started full production
in fiscal year 2014. Customers of SEBS products during the fiscal year 2015 and 2014 include trading agents and end-user factories.
Most of our SEBS customers are located in Southern and Eastern China such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian. Advance payments or
down payments are required for all orders from both the agents and end users. We have two SEBS patents for Keyuan Synthetic Rubber:
KYSEBS1310 and KYSEBS1320. The sales to trading agents in 2015 accounted for 56% and 79% of the total sales of SEBS under each
patent license, respectively. 

GOING
CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S PLANS    

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we
reported net loss of approximately $60.5 million.  For
the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $112.5 million. At December 31, 2015, we had working
capital deficits of approximately $284.6 million.  

Although
we continue to finance our operations primarily through short-term bank borrowings and management s realignment of product
profiles, along with the general stabilization of the petrochemical industry in China, our operation resulted in net loss of $60.5
million in 2015 compared to a net loss of $47.1 million in 2014 and a net profit of $4.6 million in 2013.  

Short-term
bank borrowings and notes payable amounted to approximately $695 million at December 31, 2015.  

These matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern.   

Management
expects that short-term bank borrowings will continue to be available through the following 12 months from the date of this report.
Since we have not defaulted on previous short-term bank borrowings, we believe the good credit history will allow us to renew
our short-term bank borrowing when they mature. Furthermore, management expects that the petrochemical industry in China
will continue to stabilize, and that demand for downstream products (such as auto, home appliances and dyes) will grow after several
years of contraction. As such, management expects that the Company will resume profitability in the next few years.  

As reported in our financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we continue to benefit from favorable PRC tax policies related to consumption
tax. As of December 31, 2015, we had consumption tax recoverable of approximately $44.4 million.  As
of July 31, 2016, all outstanding tax recoverable as of December 31, 2015 was refunded.  

We believe that the Company s cash, working capital and access to cash through its bank loans, assuming they will remain
available to us through the following 12 months from the date of this report, provide adequate capital resources to fund its
operations and working capital needs through at least 12 months from the date of this report. 

We
are also exploring sources of additional financing, including short-term financing from our vendors and other parties and potential
equity financing if the terms are acceptable to us. In addition, we are closely monitoring our cash balance, cash needs and expense
levels.  

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management s ability to implement our expansion plan, obtain additional
capital and generate net income and positive cash flows from operations. There can be no assurance that these plans will be sufficient
or that additional financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to us, if at all.  

Short-term
Bank Borrowings   

We have entered into short-term loan agreements
with our primary lenders such as Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China. As of December 31, 2015,
December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately $361 million, $568 million and
$424 million outstanding under the loan agreements. The short-term borrowings usually mature from two months to twelve months
and the loan agreements  were mainly
guaranteed by third parties and individual persons or secured by a lien on our property and equipment. Historically, all debts
due have been paid back by the Company in a timely manner. All short-term bank loans are revolving loans, and the lenders generally
agree to extend the loans upon maturity if we request. As the date of this report, we have timely repaid or renewed all short-term
bank loans. As of December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the terms of our loan
agreements. As such, management expects outstanding bank loans will be extended if not paid back upon maturity. Depending on our
capital needs, we evaluate whether to apply for additional long-term bank loans. We currently have sufficient lines of credit
with our primary lenders for both short-term and long-term borrowings for our operations.  

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION   

As
a U.S. public company and a Nevada corporation, we are subject to various U.S. and Nevada laws and regulations such as U.S. securities
laws, banking laws and Nevada Revised Statutes. In addition, we are subject to various Chinese laws and regulations because we
operate in China and have PRC subsidiaries. This section sets forth a summary of the most significant Chinese laws and regulations
that may affect our operation in China or our stockholders  right to receive dividends and other distributions of profits
from our PRC subsidiaries.  

Foreign
Investment in PRC Operating Companies    

Under
the current Chinese regulations, the petrochemical and rubber industry is categorized as an industry in which foreign investment
is permitted, therefore, our PRC subsidiaries are permitted to accept foreign investment and ownership.  

Regulation
of Foreign Currency Exchange    

Foreign
currency exchange in the PRC is governed by a series of regulations, including but not limited to the  Foreign Currency Administrative
Rules of 1996, as amended , and the  Administrative Regulations Regarding Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange
of 1996, as amended . Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises (the   FIEs  ) may exchange
RMB into foreign currency without the approval of State Administration of Foreign Exchange (  SAFE  ) for trade
and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also
retain foreign currency to pay dividends. However, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities may limit or eliminate the ability
of FIEs to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment,
loan and investment in securities outside the PRC are still subject to approvals from SAFE.  

Regulation
of FIEs  Dividend Distribution    

The
principal laws and regulations in China governing distribution of dividends by FIEs include:  

(1)  
       The Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law of 1979,
as amended, and the Regulations for the Implementation of the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law of 1983, as amended;    

(2)  
       The Sino-foreign Cooperative Enterprise Law of 1988,
as amended, and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Sino-foreign Cooperative Enterprise Law of 1995, as amended;
and     

(3)  
       The Foreign Investment Enterprise Law of 1986, as
amended, and the Regulations of Implementation of the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law of 1990, as amended.    

Under
these regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with
Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly-owned foreign enterprise in the PRC is required to set aside
at least 10% of its respective accumulated profits each year, if any, as reserved funds unless such reserved funds have reached
50% of its registered capital. These reserved funds are not distributable as cash dividends.  

Regulation
of Foreign Direct Investment in China    

Under
current Chinese regulations including but not limited to  Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration
Policies on Foreign Direct Investment  promulgated by SAFE in November 2012 and  Circular on Printing and Distributing the
Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors  promulgated by SAFE in
May 2013, foreign institution and individuals must register with SAFE and/or its local branches for their direct investment in
China. When opening various special purposes foreign exchange accounts (e.g., pre-establishment expenses account, foreign exchange
capital account, and guarantee account), banks process foreign exchange relating to the direct investment in China based on the
registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.  

Regulation
of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions    

In
October 2005, SAFE issued the  Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and
Return Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies  (the   Notice
75  ). SAFE also issued implemented rules to Notice 75. Notice 75 and its implementation rules require PRC residents
(including both corporate entities and natural persons) to register with SAFE or its competent local branch in connection
with their direct or indirect shareholding in any company outside of China referred to as an  special purpose
company  (the   SPV  ). Under Notice 75,  an SPV refers to an offshore entity established or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC residents for the purpose of seeking offshore equity financing using assets or
interests owned by such PRC residents in onshore companies. In addition, any PRC resident that is the stockholder of an SPV is
required to amend his or her SAFE registration with the SAFE or its competent local branch, with respect to that SPV in
connection with any of increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation
of any security interest over any assets located in China. The SAFE regulations require retroactive approval and registration
of direct or indirect investments previously made by PRC residents in SPVs. PRC subsidiaries of an SPV are required to
coordinate and supervise the filing of SAFE registrations by the offshore holding company s stockholders who are PRC
residents in a timely manner. In the event that a PRC residential stockholder with a direct or indirect investment in an
offshore parent company fails to obtain the required SAFE approval and make the required registration, the PRC
subsidiaries of such offshore parent company may be prohibited from making distributions of profits to the offshore parent
and from paying the offshore parent proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect of the
PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with SAFE approval and registration requirements described above could result in
liability under PRC law for foreign currency exchange evasion.  

Uncertainty remains as to how certain
procedures and requirements under the aforesaid SAFE regulations will be enforced, and it remains unclear how these existing
regulations, and any future legislation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and
implemented by the relevant government authorities. Although we have requested PRC residents who, to our knowledge, hold
direct or indirect interests in our Company to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under
Notice 75 and other related rules, we do not believe that our PRC residential stockholders have completed such approvals and
registrations required by the SAFE regulations. We will attempt to comply, and attempt to ensure that all of our stockholders
subject to these rules comply with the relevant requirements. We cannot, however, assure the compliance of all of our
China-resident stockholders. Any current or future failure to comply with the relevant requirements could subject us to fines
or sanctions imposed by the Chinese government, including restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries  ability to pay
dividends or hinder our investment in those subsidiaries or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our
business and prospects. 

Regulations
on Employee Stock Option Plans    

In
December 2006, the People s Bank of China promulgated  the Administrative Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals ,
which set forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC or non-PRC citizens)
under either the current account or the capital account. In February 2012, SAFE promulgated  the Notice on Issues Related to
Foreign Exchange Administration on Domestic Individuals' Participation in Equity Incentive Plans of Overseas-Listed Company .
Under current effective rules, if a PRC resident participates in any equity incentive plan of an oversea publicly-listed company,
a qualified PRC domestic agent must, among other things, file on behalf of such participant an application with SAFE to conduct
the SAFE registration with respect to such equity incentive plan and obtain approval for an annual allowance with respect to the
purchase of foreign exchange in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options or other securities such participant holds.
Such participating PRC residents' foreign exchange income received from the sale of stock and dividends distributed by the overseas
publicly-listed company must be fully remitted into a PRC collective foreign currency account opened and managed by the PRC agent
before distribution to such participants.  

Further,
the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation (the   SAT  ) jointly issued a notice and its
implementing rules concerning the individual income tax on earnings from employee share options, which require that domestic companies
that implement employee share option programs shall (1) file with the local tax authorities having jurisdiction over them (i)
the employee share option plans and other relevant documents before implementing such employee share option plans; and (ii) share
option exercise notices and other relevant documents before the employees exercise share options; (2) clarify whether shares issuable
under employee share options are the shares of publicly listed companies; and (3) withhold taxes from PRC employees in connection
with PRC individual income tax.  

We
and our PRC employees who participated in the employee stock incentive plan, which we adopted in 2010, are subject to these regulations.
We and our PRC option grantees have not completed the registrations under these regulations. We cannot assure you that we and
our PRC option grantees will be able to complete the required registrations. Any current or future failure to comply with the
relevant requirements could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the Chinese government, which could adversely affect our
business and prospects.  

Government
Regulations Relating to Taxation    

According
to  the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law  (the   EIT Law  ) promulgated by the National People s Congress,
FIEs and domestic companies are subject to a uniform tax rate of 25%.  

The
EIT Law and its implementing rules provide that an income tax rate of 10% may be applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors
that are  non-resident enterprises  that (1) do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or (2)
have such establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment
or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. The income tax for non-resident enterprises
shall be subject to withholding at the income source, with the payer acting as the obligatory withholder under the EIT Law, and
therefore such income taxes generally called withholding tax in practice. Such income tax may be exempted or reduced by the State
Council of the PRC or pursuant to a tax treaty between the PRC and the jurisdictions in which our non-PRC stockholders reside.
For example, the 10% withholding tax is reduced to 5% pursuant to the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement Between Hong Kong and Mainland
China if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the registered capital in a company in the PRC and is determined
by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the other conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Agreement
Between Hong Kong and Mainland China and other applicable laws. We are a U.S. holding company and substantially all of our income
is derived from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries located in the PRC. Thus, if Keyuan HK are considered as a  non-resident
enterprise  under the EIT Law and the dividends paid to Keyuan HK by our subsidiaries in the PRC are considered income sourced
within the PRC, such dividends may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate up to 10%.  

For
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, Ningbo Keyuan, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemical, Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers, Zhongkexuneng
and Guangxi Keyuan were subject to 25% tax rate. On June 30, 2014, Guangxi Keyuan has obtained the recognition from the tax authorities
for the qualification to enjoy the Western Development Enterprise Preferential Tax Policy, which applies a favorable tax rate
of 15% from the year that it generates revenue to year 2020. We expect Guangxi Keyuan to generate revenue in 2018.  

Regulations
on Work Safety    

Work
safety in China is governed primarily by the following regulations:  

1.    The
                                         2002 Work Safety Law of the PRC, as amended, providing general work safety requirements
                                         for entities engaging in manufacturing and business activities within the PRC.                                                                                                                                            

2.    The
                                          2002 Regulation on Work Safety Licenses , as amended (  RWSL  ),
                                         adopted by the State Council, requiring enterprises engaging in the manufacture of dangerous
                                         chemicals to obtain a work safety license with a term of three years.                                                                                                                                   

3.    The
                                         2004  Measures for Implementation of Work Safety Licenses of Dangerous Chemicals Production ,
                                         as amended, promulgated as implementing measures to RWSL, providing that entities producing
                                         dangerous chemicals are required to obtain work safety licenses pursuant to specific
                                         requirements, and detailed and comprehensive requirements and conditions for obtaining
                                         work safety licenses for dangerous chemicals production.                                                                                                                      

4.    The
                                          2002 Regulations on the Safety Administration of Dangerous Chemicals , as amended
                                         (  RSADC  ), setting forth general requirements for manufacturing and
                                         storage of dangerous chemicals in China. The RSADC requires that companies manufacturing
                                         dangerous chemicals establish and strengthen their internal regulations and rules on
                                         safety control and fulfill the national standards and other relevant provisions of the
                                         PRC. In addition, according to the RSADC, companies that manufacture, store, transport
                                         or use dangerous chemicals shall be required to obtain corresponding approvals or licenses
                                         with the State Administration of Work Safety and its local branches and other proper
                                         authorities. Companies that manufacture or store dangerous chemicals without approval
                                         or registration with the proper authorities can be shut down, suspended or ordered to
                                         destroy the dangerous chemicals. Such companies can also be subject to fines.                                                                                                                                           

5.    The
                                          2012 Implementing Measures on the Permits for Safe  Use of Hazardous Chemicals,
                                         promulgated by the State Administration of Work Safety which sets forth the detailed
                                         procedures, conditions and documents required for application for permits for safe use
                                         of dangerous chemicals.    

The Company has put work place safety as
one of the top priorities for our operation. In order to comply with the aforementioned rules and regulations, as of December
31, 2015, we have invested approximately $1.6 million in improving work place safety systems. We have installed a distribution
control system (DCS), emergency shutdown system, electric explosion protection system, automatic interlocking system, detecting
  alarming system for inflammable and toxic gas, fire protection and fire detecting system, auto-sprinkling system, and pressure
release and control system. The Company s manufacturing subsidiaries Ningbo Keyuan, Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers and Guangxi
Keyuan have obtained all necessary work safety licenses. We are in compliance with all relevant work safety laws and regulations. 

Regulations
on Environmental Protection    

The
Environmental Protection Law of 1989, as amended  sets forth enhanced governmental authority in enforcing the
environmental protection law. For example, the environmental protection bureau may directly freeze assets of a polluter; the
police may detain the responsible person; the administrative fines will accrue on daily basis without a cap; and
non-governmental organizations may initiate litigation against polluters in the public interest.  

According
to  the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution Law , the PRC adopted a licensing system for pollutant discharge. A company
directly or indirectly responsible for discharge of industrial waste water or medical sewage to waters is required to obtain a
pollutant discharge license. Without a pollutant discharge license or an approval from the competent authority, companies are
prohibited from discharging wastewater and sewage to waters. As Ningbo city is currently working on setting up an inspection system
of the pollutant discharge, there is no specific pollutant discharge license for our operating subsidiaries Ningbo Keyuan and
Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers. However, Ningbo Keyuan and Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers  facilities have passed inspection with Ningbo
city environmental protection authorities which includes an approval for the pollutant discharge.  

The
Regulations on the Administration of Construction Projects Environmental Protection of 1998, as amended  (  RACPEP  ) ,
 governs construction projects and their environmental impacts. Pursuant to the RACPEP, the governing body is responsible for
supervising the implementation of a three tiered system that includes (1) reviewing and approving a construction project, (2)
overseeing the construction project and (3) inspecting the finished construction project and ensuring that all harmful pollutants
are disposed of correctly. Manufacturing companies are required to apply for inspection with environmental protection authorities
upon completion of a construction project. All of our facilities have passed the inspection by the environmental protection
authorities.  

In
order to meet the above mentioned requirements for environmental protection, we have invested about RMB 40 million (approximately
$6.3 million) and built facilities including a sewage treatment facility, a sulphur recovery facility, a sea water desulphurization
facility, a flue gas treatment facility and a real-time monitoring system for environmental protection. With these facilities,
we believe we are able to meet all the environmental protection standards set by the relevant government agencies, and we are
currently in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  

Research and Development  

We
consider ourselves as a technology driven innovative Company. Our senior management combined has over one hundred years of industry
experience. We continue to enhance our technology through internal and external research and development. During the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we spent approximately $3.9 million and $1.6 million on research and development activities,
respectively.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.  

THE
FOLLOWING MATTERS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OR PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE. ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM
THOSE IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT OR STATEMENTS.  

Risks
Related to Our Business    

Our
independent registered public accounting firm added an emphasis paragraph to its audit report describing an uncertainty related
to our ability to continue as a going concern .  

Due to our limited capital resources, our
independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that describes an uncertainty related to our ability to continue
as a going concern. The auditors  report discloses that we consumed cash in operating activities in 2015 and that we
had a working capital deficiency at December 31, 2015. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern and may make it difficult for us to raise capital and make 
our securities an unattractive investment for potential investors. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We may be unable to continue operations if we cannot generate revenues in excess
of our expenses.  

Our
limited operating history   

We
have a limited operating history and have encountered and expect to continue to encounter many of the difficulties and uncertainties
often faced by early-stage companies. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects, including
our ability to develop a wide customer and distribution network for our products, to expand our operations to include additional
products and to control raw material costs, all of which are critical to our success. To date, we have been primarily focused
on the stabilization and realignment of our production, and our original expansion plan has been delayed, extended and adjusted
due to various reasons. This limited history also makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult, and may increase
the risk of your investment. We have limited experience as a consolidated operating entity, particularly with commercialization
activities, and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered
by a young company. An investor must consider our business and our prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties
common to early stage companies. We may encounter unanticipated problems, expenses and delays in carrying out our expansion plan.
We may not be able to successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our
stock price may suffer, and we may be unable to stay in business.   

Key
employees are essential to growing our business.   

Mr.
Chunfeng Tao is essential to our ability to continue to grow our business. He has established relationships with customers and
suppliers within the industries in which we operate. If he were to leave us, our relationships with our customers and suppliers
may become strained, and our growth strategy might be hindered, which could limit our ability to increase revenue.  

In
addition, we still face competition from other companies located in the same area for attracting skilled workers. If we fail to
attract and retain qualified workers to meet our current and future needs, this could slow our business growth, which could result
in a decrease in market share and affect our revenues and stock price.  

We
continue to be dependent on bank loans in order to fund our purchases of raw materials.   

In
order to operate our business efficiently, we rely on short-term bank loans to fund the purchase of raw materials. As of
December 31, 2015, we had approximately $361 million of short-term debt and lines of credit from 11 banks. Typically,
the term for a short term bank loan is one year. Bank loans are renewable at the banks  option. In 2015, we repaid
approximately $792 million and borrowed approximately $596  million  in the form
of short-term bank loans. If one or more of these banks were to revoke its line of credit or we fail to renew bank loans when
they become due, we would be unable to continue to purchase raw materials in the amounts necessary to continue production at our
current capacity. Any such inability will cause us to lose potential revenues.  

We
continue to have significant concentration with regard to our revenue and raw material purchases.   

For
the year ended December 31, 2015, our five largest customers accounted for 33% of our total sales. For the year ended December
31, 2014, our five largest customers accounted for 27% of our total sales. Sales to one major customer accounted for 9% and 6%
of our total annual net revenue for the fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Though our customer base may change from year-to-year,
during such years that the customer base is comparatively highly concentrated, the loss of, or reduction of our sales to, any
of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  

We currently buy a majority of our heavy
oil, an important component of our products, from three suppliers. Purchases (net of VAT) from the largest three suppliers for
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $308.3 million and $609.7 million, respectively, in the aggregate.
These purchases represented 49% and 79%, respectively of all of our purchases for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
The Company s largest supplier accounted for approximately $ 115.0
million and $525.8 million, or 18% and 68% of total purchases for the years ended December 2015 and 2014, respectively. There
are a limited number of suppliers of the particular heavy oil we use in production. A change in suppliers, if we can find one,
could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales, which would affect operating results adversely.  

We
need additional capital to carry out our expansion plan.   

The
total estimated cost of our expansion plan is approximately $372.5 million, including $300 million for Guangxi Project, $30 million
for the transformer oil facility, $40 million for the increased annual design capacity of ethylene- styrene, and $2.5 million
for additional storage capacity.  

We
plan to fund these expansions through short-term borrowings, cash from operations, potential long-term borrowings and equity financing.
However, our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including, but
not limited to:  

our
    future results of operations, financial condition and cash flow;   

PRC
    governmental regulations of foreign investment in petrochemical manufacturing companies in China;   

economic,
    political and other conditions in China; and   

PRC
    governmental policies relating to foreign currency borrowings   

We
cannot assure you that we will be successful in our expansion plan. If we are not successful, or the costs exceed our expectations,
the expansion may not be accretive, and we may not recoup the costs spent. This can affect our stock price, revenues and profitability.  

Our
operations may be affected by the cyclical nature of the petrochemical and synthetic rubbers market and by the volatility of prices
of our raw materials and finished products.   

All
of our revenues are attributable to petrochemical products and synthetic rubbers. Markets for many of our products are sensitive
to changes in industry capacity and output levels, cyclical changes in regional and global economic conditions, the price and
availability of substitute products and changes in consumer demand, which from time to time have had a significant impact on product
prices in the regional and global markets. Historically, the markets for petrochemical and rubber products have experienced periods
of tight supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, resulting in oversupply and
declining prices and margins. As tariffs and other import restrictions are reduced and the control of product pricing is relaxed
in China, the markets for many of our products have become increasingly subject to the cyclicality of regional and global markets.  

Raw
material costs accounted for 48% and 61% of our cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The markets for
these raw materials - namely, oil - have been volatile historically, may continue to be volatile in the future, and are beyond
our control based on a number of potential factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  

The
                                         worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil;    

Volatility
                                         and trading patterns in the markets;    

The
                                         cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil;    

The
                                         level of global oil inventories;    

Weather
                                         conditions;   

The
                                         ability of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (  OPEC  )
                                         and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels;   

The
                                         worldwide military and political environment;    

Civil
                                         and political unrest in Africa and the Middle East;    

Uncertainty
                                         or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities,
                                         or acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere;   

The
                                         effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts;   

The
                                         price and availability of alternative and competing fuels;   

The
                                         level of foreign imports of oil;   

Governmental
                                         laws, regulations, and taxes;   

The
                                         proximity to, and capacity of, pipelines and other transportation facilities; and    

General
                                         economic conditions worldwide.     

The
long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil is uncertain. Prolonged or further declines in these commodity
prices may have the following negative effects on our business:  

Adversely
                                         affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures,
                                         and results of operations;    

Causing
                                         us to delay or postpone our expansion plan;    

Reducing
                                         our revenues, operating income, or cash flows;   

Temporarily causing us to shut down our operations until prices rise; and  

Limiting
                                         our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and debt
                                         securities and long-term debt.     

Our
operation may be interrupted by weather conditions and power shutdowns   

Our
operating results depend largely on the uninterrupted operation of our business. Our current facilities are located at Beilun,
Ningbo, China on China s east coast. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, storms, floods,
and other severe weather events can disrupt our operations. Additionally, we are located in an industrial park where the infrastructure
such as the electricity grid is in need of periodic upgrade. Natural conditions discussed above and/or mandatory power shutdowns
due to the periodic electricity grid upgrades may cause disruptions to our operations which can significantly affect our ability
to manufacture and/or sell products, resulting in a substantial loss of sales and revenues and substantial harm to our operating
results.  

We
may be exposed to risks relating to our disclosure controls and our internal controls.   

Effective
internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system
of internal controls over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   

During the process of preparing the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, in March, 2011, KPMG, the Company s former independent
auditor, raised certain issues primarily relating to certain cash transactions and recorded sales and requested that the
Audit Committee conduct an independent investigation. Based on the issues raised by KPMG, our Audit Committee elected to commence
an independent investigation of the issues raised. Following the investigation, our Audit Committee identified, among other issues,
inadequate disclosure and issues regarding internal control and procedures. In order to improve corporate governance and
enhance internal controls, management and our Board of Directors committed to adopting and implementing the recommendations
of the Audit Committee, some of which we have not yet rectified. For more details of the corrective actions, please refer
to Item 9A Controls and Procedures.  

We
cannot currently ensure that our controls and procedures will be effective at any time in the immediate future. Moreover,
in order to improve our controls and procedures we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant costs. Failure to
properly improve our controls and procedures could result in our failure to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement
of our past financial statements, cause harm to our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our Common
Stock, all of which present significant risk to our investors.  

We
are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations.   

We
are subject to various PRC environmental laws and regulations that require us to obtain environmental permits for our operations.
If we fail to obtain all required environmental permits for our operations, or fail to comply with the provisions of any permit,
we could be subject to fines, criminal charges or other sanctions by regulators, including the suspension or termination of our
operations. We are required to comply with extensive and complex environmental laws and regulations at various levels in the PRC
relating to, among other things:  

The
    handling of petrochemical and rubber products;   

The
    operation of product storage facilities;   

Workplace
    safety;   

Environmental
    damage; and   

Hazardous
    waste disposal.   

If
we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of environmental
laws or regulations, we will be subject to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we will be subject to substantial fines
or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. We cannot assure you that at all times we will be in compliance with environmental
laws and regulations or our environmental permits or that we will not be required to expend significant funds to comply with,
or discharge liabilities arising under, environmental laws, regulations and permits.  

Accidents
or injuries in or around our facility may adversely affect our reputation and subject us to liability.   

As of the date of this report, we had three safety related accidents (as described in Item 1 Business above)
in our facilities all of which happened in 2014 and caused a cost to us of approximately $8.5 million. There are inherent risks
of accidents or injuries when working in or around our manufacturing facilities. Serious accidents or injuries could prevent us
from renewing our safety licenses or result in suspension of our operation. One or more accidents or injuries at our facility could
adversely affect our reputation among customers and potential customers and increase our costs if we are required to take additional
measures to make our safety precautions more effective. We may not be adequately insured to cover the costs and liabilities associated
with accidents.      

We
must protect our technologies.   

Our
manufacturing technologies and process, some of which have not been patented or registered as our property, are key components
of our competitive advantage and our growth strategy. We rely on confidentiality and license agreements with certain of our
employees, customers and others to protect our technologies. If we are unable to adequately protect the confidentiality of these
technologies, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.  

We
incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.   

Though
we are currently a smaller reporting company with a market cap less than $75 million, we have incurred and will incur significant
legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not or otherwise would not incur as a private company. We may continue to incur
costs for the various corrective actions we are taking and committed to taking to improve our internal controls and procedures,
as well as corporate governance. Furthermore, if the Company s market cap exceeds $75 million, we will be subject to the
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented
by the SEC, has required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these rules and regulations,
along with the corrective actions to improve our controls and procedures, to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance
costs and to make certain corporate activities more time-consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional
costs we may incur or the timing of the occurrence of such costs.  

We
may lose our property and/or equipment if we fail to repay the short-term bank loans.    

We enter into short-term bank loan agreements
with our primary lenders to fund our operation. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately
$361 million and $ 568 million outstanding
under the loan agreements. Some of these loans are secured by a lien on our property and/or equipment. We may be unable to repay
these loans if our cash and liquidity position changes or our operation is not successful, which may cause us to lose the possession
of our property and/or equipment, and adversely impact our operation. If we lose our equipment we may be unable to produce our
products until we replace the equipment, if we can, and which would cause us to lose business and we may not be able to continue
operating.   

We
may be subject to penalties or fines from the Chinese government as a result of possible violations of PRC laws or regulations   

Our
management and our Board of Directors have reviewed our past practices and have been advised that several of the following practices
may result in possible violation of PRC laws or regulations. Specifically:  

In
                                         the past, we sometimes accommodated requests from our customers to change the name of
                                         products so that our customers could save on freight costs. In September 2010, we adopted
                                         a numbering system to bar scan our products to avoid any misrepresentation of the nature
                                         of our products;    

In
                                         the past, in order to overcome the restrictions regarding the use of certain bank loans
                                         or to satisfy the banks  internal requirements to demonstrate the usage of the
                                         loans, we engaged with certain related and other parties in short term financings. We
                                         were advised that such practices might have been in violation of PRC banking laws;    

In
                                         2010, RMB 21 million was transferred by Ningbo Keyuan to one of its employees with no
                                         collateral or written agreement. The RMB 21 million was subsequently returned by the
                                         employee. This arrangement was made to assist an investor in the September 2010 Private
                                         Placement, in converting RMB to U.S. dollars, which may violate PRC foreign currency
                                         exchange laws and regulations; and    

Ningbo
                                         Keyuan discounted and continue to discount bank notes in order to use its effective credit
                                         lines and finance our growth. Such practice may be a potential violation of PRC banking
                                         laws.    

We
cannot assure you that we may not be subject to penalties or fines from the Chinese regulators if they decide to proceed against
us and we cannot assure you that there will be no other violation of any current PRC laws or regulations identified by the relevant
government regulators.  

We
may face litigation and/or regulatory action as a result of certain events.   

As
a result of certain events, including but not limited to the delisting of our Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market, our failure
to file periodic reports as they were due and our failure to comply with certain registration requirements related to common shares
underlying our preferred stock and warrants, we became subject to litigation from stockholders and other investors. In November
2013, The Rosen Law Firm filed a class action law suit against us. In February 2014, The Brown Law Firm filed a derivative law
suit against us and certain directors and officers. In addition, in October 2014, Dragon State filed the Complaint against us.
As of today, these three litigations have been settled. Additionally, we may also become subject to regulatory enforcement actions
in either the U.S. and/or China. If we are forced to defend either a civil law suit brought by outside stockholders or investors
and/or a regulatory action, we will be required to expend significant additional funds that could otherwise be utilized for business
purposes. Defense of such claims would also require management to expend additional time and focus in connection with such defense
which may materially impact its ability to effectively run our business, regardless of whether we are ultimately successful.  

We
have accepted continuing obligations related to our corporate governance.   

In
February 2014, a derivative action was filed alleging breach of fiduciary duties arising primarily out of transactions which occurred
in 2009 and 2010 between us and certain related parties or other parties. Because the derivative litigation would be expensive
and distracting, we settled the lawsuit in July 2015 without admitting to any wrongdoing. We agreed, among other matters, to make
certain modifications to our corporate governance including expanding our nomination and corporate governance committee and adopting
a related-party transaction policy. The settlement agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.4 to this report. We continue to implement
the modifications we agreed to under the settlement agreement. If we do not fully comply with the terms of the settlement agreement,
we could be sued for breach of the settlement agreement. Any lawsuit could be costly for us, reduce our share price, and deviate
our management s time away from running our business.  

We
may be subject to penalties or fines from the U.S. tax authorities as a result of possible violations of federal and state tax
laws or regulations   

Keyuan Petrochemicals Inc., as a  U.S.
public company and Nevada corporation, is subject to various U.S. and Nevada laws and regulations. U.S. federal tax law generally
requires U.S. corporations to file U.S. tax returns every year. Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc. may be subject to penalties for failure
to file U.S. federal tax returns. In addition, we may be required to file certain foreign tax disclosures on forms 5471 and 5472
on an annual basis. In general, penalties for failure to file forms 5471 and 5472 are $10,000 per failure, per year.  

We may be subject to penalties or
fines from the Hong Kong tax authorities as a result of possible violations of Hong Kong tax laws or regulations  

Keyuan HK, as a HK company, is subject to various Hong Kong laws and regulations. Hong Kong tax law generally
requires Hong Kong companies to file Hong Kong tax returns. Keyuan HK may be subject to penalties for failure to file Hong Kong
tax returns. 

Risks
Relating to Regulation of Our Business     

Uncertainties
with respect to the governing regulations could have a material and adverse effect on us.   

There
are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the PRC laws and regulations, including, but not
limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business and our ownership of the equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries
which are classified as wholly owned foreign entities (the   WOFEs  ) under the PRC laws. PRC laws and regulations
are frequently modified due to rapid economic and social developments and many of them have been newly enacted within the last
twenty years. Certain new laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively.  

The
PRC government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business
permits and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted
to the PRC subsidiaries by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot
predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot assure you that
our current ownership and operating structure would not be found to be in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations.
As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to
operate. In addition, any litigation in relation thereto in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion
of resources and management attention. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or
restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our
PRC subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on dividend payments.   

We conduct all of our business through our
consolidated subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC. We rely on dividends paid by these consolidated subsidiaries for our cash needs,
including the funds necessary to pay any dividends and other cash distributions to our stockholders, to service any debt we may
incur and to pay our operating expenses. The payment of dividends by entities established in the PRC is subject to limitations. Current
regulations in the PRC permit PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated distributable profits, if
any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries are required
to set aside a reserve of at least 10% (up to an aggregate amount equal to half of its registered capital) of each subsidiary s
accumulated profits each year. Such cash reserve may not be distributed as cash dividends. In addition, if any PRC subsidiary
incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make
other payments to us. 

Additionally,
under Financial Accounting Standard Board (  FASB  ) Accounting Standard Codification (  ASC  )
Topic 740-30, no deferred tax expense is required to be recorded on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries when the parent company
establishes that the earnings will be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. If dividend payments are made by our subsidiaries
to the Company, additional U.S. tax could become due in future years. At the time of the repatriation or investment in U.S.
property, the U.S. will tax the foreign earnings as a dividend and will allow a foreign tax credit for any foreign taxes previously
paid on the earnings. To the extent that dividend payments are made by our PRC subsidiaries to the Company, additional tax
may be due.  

PRC
regulates loans and direct investments by overseas holding companies in PRC entities.   

Under
PRC laws, foreign investors may make loans to their PRC subsidiaries or foreign investors may make additional capital contributions
to their PRC subsidiaries. Any loans to such PRC subsidiaries are subject to the PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations,
i.e. loans by foreign investors to their PRC subsidiaries to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must
be registered with the SAFE or its local branch. Foreign investors may also decide to finance their PRC subsidiaries by means
of additional capital contributions. These capital contributions must be examined and approved by the SAFE, or its local branch
in advance. These registration or approval procedures may delay or prevent us from making overseas loans or additional capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.  

Under
the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a  resident enterprise  of China.   

Under
the EIT Law, FIEs and domestic companies are subject to a uniform tax rate of 25%.  

In
addition, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with  de facto management bodies  within China
is considered a  resident enterprise,  meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise
for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as  substantial and
overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties  of the enterprise.
The specific criteria for determining whether the  de facto management body  of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is
incorporated offshore is located in China, includes all of the following factors: (a) the location where senior management members
responsible for an enterprise s daily operations discharge their duties; (b) the location where financial and human resource
decisions are made or approved by organizations or persons; (c) the location where the major assets and corporate documents are
kept; and (d) the location where more than half (inclusive) of all directors with voting rights or senior management have their
habitual residence. Although the above only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups,
not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria may reflect the SAT s general position on
how the  de facto management body  text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises,
regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Due to lack of applicable legal precedents,
it remains unclear how the PRC tax authorities will determine the PRC tax resident treatment of a foreign company controlled by
individuals like us.  

If
the PRC tax authorities determine that we are  resident enterprises  for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number
of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our
worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income
such as interest on offering proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%.
Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as
 tax-exempt income,  we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax. It is possible
that  resident enterprise  classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on
dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC enterprise stockholders
from transferring our shares and a 20% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC individual stockholders and
with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC individual stockholders from transferring our shares. We are actively monitoring
the possibility of  resident enterprise  treatment for the applicable tax years and are evaluating appropriate organizational
changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.  

If
we were treated as a  resident enterprise  by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S.
and China, and our PRC tax may not be credited against our U.S. tax.  

We
face uncertainty from China s Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Non-Resident Enterprises'
Share Transfer.   

The
SAT released a circular (  Circular 698  ) in December 2009 that addresses the transfer of shares by nonresident
companies. Circular 698, which is effective retroactively to January 1, 2008, has had a significant impact on many companies that
use offshore holding companies to invest in China. Pursuant to Circular 698, where the withholding agent does not withhold in
accordance with laws or can t perform the withholding obligation, the non-resident enterprises must file a tax declaration
with the PRC tax authority located at the place of the resident enterprise whose equity has been transferred, within seven days
after the date of the equity transfer provided under the contracts, or the date the transferor receives the income, whichever
is earlier.  

Where
a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise by selling the shares in an offshore
holding company, and the latter is located in a country or jurisdiction where the effective tax burden is less than 12.5% or where
the offshore income of his, her, or its residents is not taxable, the foreign investor is required to provide the tax authority
in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise with the relevant information within 30 days upon the execution of the equity transfer
agreement. Moreover, where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise through formation
of an organization and there are no reasonable commercial purposes such that the enterprise income tax liability is avoided, the
PRC tax authority will have the power to re-assess the nature of the equity transfer in accordance with PRC s  substance-over-form 
principle and deny the existence of the offshore holding company that is used for tax avoidance purposes.  

If
Circular 698 were to apply to us, it would negatively affect us, as it would subject us to additional taxes, and we would be liable
for not complying with Circular 698 earlier.  

Our
PRC subsidiaries are obligated to withhold and pay PRC individual income tax on behalf of our employees who are subject to PRC
individual income tax.    

Under
PRC laws, Ningbo Keyuan, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Zhongkexuneng, Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers and Guangxi Keyuan are obligated
to withhold and pay individual income tax on behalf of our employees who are subject to PRC individual income tax. If any PRC
subsidiary fails to withhold and/or pay such individual income tax in accordance with PRC laws, it may be subject to certain sanctions
and other penalties and may become subject to liability under PRC laws. We withheld individual income tax on all amount paid to
employees, senior management members and outside individual service providers in 2014 and 2015. If we fail to follow these regulations
in the future, we may be subject to certain sanctions and other penalties and may become subject to liability under applicable
tax laws in China.  

In
addition, the SAT has issued several circulars concerning employee stock options. Under these circulars, our employees working
in the PRC (which could include both PRC employees and expatriate employees subject to PRC individual income tax) who exercise
stock options will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Each of our PRC subsidiaries has obligations to file documents related
to employee stock options with relevant tax authorities and withhold and pay individual income taxes for those employees who exercise
their stock options. While tax authorities may advise us that our policy is compliant, they may also change their policy, and
we could be subject to sanctions or penalties.  

Regulations
of Overseas Investments and Listings may increase the administrative burden we face and create regulatory uncertainties.   

Six
PRC regulatory agencies, including the MOFCOM, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the   CSRC  ), the
State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission, the SAT, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the SAFE,
amended and released the New M A Rule, which took effect in September, 2006 (the   M A Rule  ). This
regulation, among other things, includes provisions that require that an SPV obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing
and trading of such SPV s securities on an overseas stock exchange.  

The
application of the M A Rule with respect to overseas listings of SPVs remains unclear because to our knowledge in practice
almost all overseas listings by Chinese companies in recent years, similar to ours, have not secured approval from the CSRC.  

We
believe that the M A Rules and the CSRC s approval were not required in the context of the share exchange under our
Share Exchange in 2010 because (1) the share exchange was a purely foreign related transaction governed by foreign laws, not subject
to the jurisdiction of PRC laws and regulations; (2) at the time of Share Exchange, we were not an SPV formed or controlled by
PRC companies or PRC individuals; (3) Ningbo Keyuan was established as a sino-foreign joint venture by means of direct investment
rather than by merger or acquisition of an existing PRC domestic company ;  (4) at the time of Share Exchange, we were owned
and controlled by foreigners; and (5) there is no clear requirement in the M A Rule that would require an application
to be submitted to the MOFCOM or the CSRC for the approval of the listing and trading of our Common Stock on a U.S. securities
market. However, we cannot be certain that the relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion,
and we still cannot rule out the possibility that the CSRC may deem that the transactions effected by the share exchange circumvented
the M A Rules, the PRC securities law and other regulations and rules.  

We
are indirectly owned or substantially controlled by a PRC individual, Mr. Chunfeng Tao. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory
agency subsequently determines that CSRC s approval was required for the Share Exchange, we may face sanctions by the CSRC
or another PRC regulatory agency. If this happens, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations
in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from financings into
the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of
our shares. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to unwind
the transaction.  

The
M A Rules, along with foreign exchange regulations discussed above, will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government
authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions, and we cannot predict how they will affect our
business development strategy.  

There
are PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore holding companies by PRC residents    

Notice
75 and its implementation rules issued by the SAFE require PRC residents (including both corporate entities and natural persons)
to register with SAFE or its competent local branch in connection with their direct or indirect shareholding in any SPV. In addition,
any PRC resident that is the stockholder of an offshore SPV is required to amend his or her SAFE registration with the SAFE or
its competent local branch, with respect to that offshore SPV in connection with any of its increase or decrease of capital, transfer
of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China. The SAFE
regulations require retroactive approval and registration of direct or indirect investments previously made by PRC residents in
offshore SPVs. PRC subsidiaries of an offshore SPV are required to coordinate and supervise the filing of SAFE registrations by
the offshore holding company s stockholders who are PRC residents in a timely manner. In the event that a PRC resident stockholder
with a direct or indirect investment in an offshore parent company fails to obtain the required SAFE approval and make the required
registration, the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore parent company may be prohibited from making distributions of profits to the
offshore parent and from paying the offshore parent proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect
of the PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE approval and registration requirements described above,
could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion.  

There
still remain uncertainties as to how certain procedures and requirements under the aforesaid SAFE regulations will be enforced,
and it remains unclear how these existing regulations, and any future legislation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions,
will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. Although we have requested PRC residents
who, to our knowledge, hold direct or indirect interests in our company to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments
as required under the Notice 75 and other related rules, we do not believe that all of our PRC resident beneficial holders have
completed such approvals and registrations required by the SAFE regulations. We cannot assure you that such PRC residents will
complete the necessary approval and registration procedures required by the SAFE regulations. We will attempt to comply, and attempt
to ensure that all of our stockholders subject to these rules comply with the relevant requirements. We cannot, however, assure
the compliance of all of our China-resident stockholders. Any current or future failure to comply with the relevant requirements
could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the Chinese government, including restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries 
ability to pay dividends or hinder our investment in those subsidiaries or affect our ownership structure, which could materially
and adversely affect our business and prospects.  

We
must comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee equity incentive plans or share option plans.   

Under
the current PRC rules, if a PRC resident participates in any equity incentive plan of an overseas publicly-listed company, a qualified
PRC domestic agent must, among other things, file on behalf of such participant an application with the SAFE to conduct the SAFE
registration with respect to such equity incentive plan and obtain approval for an annual allowance with respect to the purchase
of foreign currency in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options or stock such participant holds. Such participating
PRC residents' foreign exchange income received from the sale of stock and dividends distributed by the overseas publicly-listed
company must be fully remitted into a PRC collective foreign currency account opened and managed by the PRC agent before distribution
to such participants.  

Further,
domestic companies that implement employee share option programs shall file the employee share option plans and other relevant
documents with the local tax authorities and withhold taxes from the PRC employees in connection with the PRC individual income
tax.  

We
and our PRC citizen employees who participate in our employee stock incentive plan, which we adopted in 2010, are subject to these
regulations. We and our PRC option grantees have not completed the registrations under these regulation s.
 Though the options issued under the incentive plan have been forfeited or expired and none of them has been exercised,
we cannot assure you that we and our PRC option grantees will be able to complete the required registrations. Any current or future
failure to comply with the relevant requirements could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the Chinese government, which
could adversely affect our business and prospects.  

We
must comply with PRC laws and regulations relating to the environmental protection and safety.   

The
Chinese government has been adopting increasingly stringent regulations relating to the safety and environmental protection, and
our business depends upon compliance with these regulations and requirements. Our current manufacturing facilities have passed
an as-build acceptance inspection and we obtained relevant safety production permits and approvals from a variety of government
authorities upon completion of such inspection. The as-build inspection is an inspection conducted by the local government to
make sure that a company meets all the conditions for normal production. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to
obtain or renew all such permits or approvals, which are subject to our fulfillment of the standards and requirements set out
by the regulatory authorities.  

Our
operations at our production facilities are subject to periodic checks by the relevant authorities in the PRC and they have the
power to take action against us, impose fines, withdraw or suspend our relevant licenses or activities or impose other penalties
if we fail to comply with relevant regulations, in the event of which our business operations may be adversely affected. In addition,
any change in the scope or application of these laws and regulations may limit our production capacity or increase our cost of
operation and could therefore have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and operating results. Our
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or legal proceedings. There can be no assurance
that the Chinese government will not impose additional or stricter laws or regulations, compliance with which may cause us to
incur significant capital expenditures, which it may not be able to pass on to our customers.  

Risks
Associated With Doing Business in China    

In
addition to the risks related to the regulation of our business, there are substantial risks generally associated with doing business
in China, as set forth in the following risk factors.   

Our
operations and assets in China are subject to significant political, economic, legal, regulatory and tax structural uncertainties.   

Our
current operation is located in Ningbo, China and virtually all of our assets are located in China. We generate our sales revenue
substantially from customers located in China. Our results of operations, financial state of affairs and future growth are, to
a significant degree, subject to China s economic, political and legal development and related uncertainties. Our operations
and results could be materially affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:  

Changes
                                         in policies by the Chinese government resulting in changes in laws or regulations or
                                         the interpretation of laws or regulations;    

Changes
                                         in taxation;    

Changes
                                         in employment restrictions;    

Import
                                         duties; and   

Currency
                                         revaluation.    

Over
the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic
activities and greater economic decentralization. If the Chinese government does not continue to pursue its present policies that
encourage foreign investment and operations in China, or if these policies are either not successful or are significantly altered,
then our business could be harmed. Following the Chinese government s policy of privatizing many state-owned enterprises,
the Chinese government has attempted to augment its revenues through increased tax collection. It also exercises significant control
over China s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations,
setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Continued efforts to increase
tax revenues could result in increased taxation expenses being incurred by us. Economic development may be limited as well by
the imposition of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation, the inadequate development of infrastructure and the potential
unavailability of adequate power and water supplies, transportation and communications. In addition, the Chinese government continues
to play a significant role in regulating industry by imposing industrial policies.  

We
derive substantially all of our sales from China.   

Substantially
all of our sales are generated from China. We anticipate that sales of our products in China will continue to represent a substantial
proportion of our total sales in the near future. Any significant decline in the condition of the PRC economy could, among other
things, adversely affect consumer demand of our products, among other things, which in turn would have a material adverse effect
on our business and financial condition.  

We
are subject to currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange.   

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar
and our operations in China use China s local currency as its functional currency. Substantially all of our revenue and
expenses are in RMB. We are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to this currency. For example, the
value of RMB depends to a large extent on Chinese government policies and China s domestic and international economic and
political developments, as well as supply and demand in the local market. From 1994 to mid-2005, the official exchange rate for
the conversion of RMB to the U.S. dollar had generally been stable and RMB had appreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar. In
July 2005, the Chinese government changed its policy of pegging the value of RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under this policy, RMB may
fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. As a result of this policy change,
RMB appreciated approximately 4.86% in 2011. RMB further appreciated approximately 0.244% in 2012, appreciated approximately 3.00%
in 2013, depreciated approximately  0.33%
in 2014, depreciated approximately 6.02% in 2015, and appreciated approximately 0.65% in the first quarter of 2016.  

It
is possible that the Chinese government could adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in more significant fluctuations
of RMB against the U.S. dollar. We can offer no assurance that RMB will be stable against the U.S. dollar or any other foreign
currency.  

The
statements of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the
extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions
could result in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our operations. Similarly, to the extent U.S. dollar weakens
against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could result in increased revenue,
operating expenses and net income for our operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency
exchange rates, the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries  financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation
gain or loss, which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In addition, we have certain assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency. Changes in the functional currency
value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss. We have not entered into
agreements or purchased instruments to hedge our exchange rate risks.  

Although
Chinese governmental policies were introduced in 1996 to allow the convertibility of RMB into foreign currency for current account
items, conversion of RMB into foreign exchange for capital items, such as foreign direct investment, loans or securities, requires
the approval of SAFE, which is under the authority of the People s Bank of China. These approvals, however, do not guarantee
the availability of foreign currency conversion. We have not and cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain all required conversion
approvals for our operations or that Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility
of RMB in the future. Because a significant amount of our future revenue may be in the form of RMB, our inability to obtain the
requisite approvals or any future restrictions on currency exchanges could limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB
to fund our business activities outside of China, or to repay foreign currency obligations, including our debt obligations, which
would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  

We
may have limited legal recourse under PRC laws if disputes arise under our contracts with third parties.   

The
Chinese government has enacted laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign
investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, their experience in implementing, interpreting and enforcing these laws and
regulations is limited, and our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable. If our
business ventures are unsuccessful, or other adverse circumstances arise from these transactions, we face the risk that the parties
to these ventures may seek ways to terminate the transactions, or, may hinder or prevent us from accessing important information
regarding the financial and business operations of these companies. The resolution of these matters may be subject to the exercise
of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government, and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter
or dispute may influence their determination. Any rights we may have to specific performance, or to seek an injunction under PRC
law, in either of these cases, are severely limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we
may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our
funds are held in uninsured PRC bank accounts   

Funds
on deposit at banks and other financial institutions in the PRC are often uninsured. A significant portion of our assets are in
the form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC, and in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to our funds on deposit.
Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash could impair our
operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue
our business.  

We
may fail to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws.   

Our
executive officers, employees and other agents are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws including China s anti-corruption
laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (  FCPA  ), which generally prohibits United States companies
from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system
of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions,
and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. However,
corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the PRC.  

While
we intend to implement measures to ensure compliance with the FCPA and China s anti-corruption laws by all individuals
involved with our Company, our employees or other agents may engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible.
Since we became a U.S. public company, we have implemented strict requirements to preclude payments to government officials
and limits on the amount employees can spend on gifts and entertaining clients. Although prior to our becoming a U.S.
public company we had given culturally traditional gifts to government officials during Spring Festival and other Chinese
traditional holidays, we believe the amounts of such gifts are below the amounts that generally trigger criminal liability
under PRC law. The gifts were not made with the intent to bribe or wrongfully influence any such officials. However, if our
employees or other agents are found to have engaged in practices that violate either U.S. or PRC laws, we could suffer severe
penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, our brand and reputation, our sales activities or our stock price could be adversely affected if we
become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by our employees or other agents.  

Foreign
exchange regulations in the PRC may change.   

RMB
is not a freely convertible currency, and the restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenues generated
in RMB to fund our business activities outside the PRC or to make dividends or other payments in United States dollars. The PRC
government strictly regulates conversion of RMB into foreign currencies. Over the years, foreign exchange regulations in the PRC
have significantly reduced the government s control over routine foreign exchange transactions under current accounts. In
the PRC, SAFE regulates the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies. Pursuant to applicable PRC laws and regulations, FIEs incorporated
in the PRC are required to apply for  Foreign Exchange Registration Certificates.  Currently, conversion within the
scope of the  current account  (e.g. remittance of foreign currencies for payment of dividends) can be effected without
requiring the approval of the SAFE. However, conversion of currency in the  capital account  (e.g. for capital items
such as direct investments, loans and securities) still requires the approval of the SAFE. If we don t comply with these
requirements, it could negatively affect our business, and we can be subject to fines or sanctions imposed by the Chinese government.  

We
are subject to PRC employment contract law and increases in the labor costs in China.   

Under
current PRC employment law, temporary employment cannot exceed more than 10% of the employment of a company. In addition, employees
who have worked continuously for more than one year are entitled to a paid vacation ranging from 5 to 15 days, depending on the
length of the employee s service. Employees who waive such vacation entitlements at the request of the employer will be
compensated for three times their normal daily salaries for each vacation day so waived. As a result, our labor costs increased
and may continue to increase.  

Increases
in the labor costs or future disputes with our employees could damage our business, financial condition or operating results.
According to PRC labor laws, the employer is responsible to deal with and pay social insurances and housing funds for all of its
employees based on the actual salary of the employees. In addition, as required by PRC regulations, we participate in various
employee benefit plans that are organized by municipal and provincial governments, including pension, work-related injury benefits,
maternity insurance, medical and unemployment benefit plans. We are required under PRC laws to make contributions to the employee
benefit plans at specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount
specified by the local government from time to time. Members of the retirement plan are entitled to a pension equal to a fixed
proportion of the salary prevailing at the member s retirement date. There is no guarantee that we and our subsidiaries
will be able to comply with the relevant requirements. Failure to comply with the various PRC labor laws and regulation requirements
described above can result in liability under PRC law.  

There
may be future inflation in China.   

In
recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. These factors have led
to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability
of credit, or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls
on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market
for our products.  

We
may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in the PRC.   

We
may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result, or for
other reasons, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data
and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet western
standards. Please refer to Item 9A. Controls and Procedures for additional information on this matter.  

You
may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in
China based on United States or other foreign laws, against us and our management.   

We
conduct substantially all of our operations in China and substantially all of our assets are located in China. In addition, our
directors and executive officers reside within China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within
the United States or elsewhere outside China upon our directors and senior executive officers, including with respect to matters
arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. It would also be difficult for investors to bring
an original lawsuit against us or our directors or executive officers before a Chinese court based on U.S. federal securities
laws or otherwise. Moreover, China does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts.  

Chinese
law governs almost all of our business  material agreements.   

The
Chinese legal system is similar to a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in
which decided legal cases have little precedential value. Although legislation in the PRC over the years has significantly improved
the protection to various forms of foreign investment and contractual arrangements in the PRC, these laws, regulations and legal
requirements are relatively new. Due to the limited volume of published judicial decisions, their non-binding nature, the short
history since their enactments, the discrete understanding of the judges or government agencies of the same legal provision, inconsistent
professional abilities of the judicators, and the inclination to protect local interest in the court room, interpretation and
enforcement of PRC laws and regulations involve uncertainties, which can limit the legal protection available to us, and foreign
investors, including our stockholders. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements can result
in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital and can have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects,
financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and
internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result,
we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation
in the PRC, regardless of outcome, may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention regardless of whether we are successful.  

Investors 
attitudes towards Chinese companies will affect us irrespective of our actions.   

The
market prices for shares of companies with operations in China have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the
operating performance of those companies or the broader stock market. The securities of some China-based companies that have listed
their securities in the United States have experienced significant volatility in recent years, including, in some cases, substantial
declines in the trading prices. The trading performances of these companies  securities after their offerings may affect
the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies listed in the United States in general, which consequently may impact the
trading performance of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions
about inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting, corporate structure or other matters of other Chinese
companies may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies in general, including us, regardless
of whether we have engaged in any inappropriate activities.  

We
are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed, and our coverage where we have it, may be
insufficient to cover losses.   

The
insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of its development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business
insurance products or offer them at a high price.  

Our
business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the manufacture of petrochemical products such as oil
spills, pipeline ruptures, and releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances, any of which could result in damage to, or
destruction of production facilities and other property; pollution or other environmental damage; and injury to persons. We do
not maintain insurance coverage for various risks, including environmental claims. A significant uninsured claim against us would
have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  

Our
insurance coverage, where we have it, may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of
the foregoing and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have
limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business such as weather. The
occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  

Risks
Related to our Securities    

Restrictions
on the reliance of rule 144 by shell companies or former shell companies.    

Pursuant
to Rule 144 of the Securities Act (the   Rule 144  ), a  shell company  is defined as a company that
has no or nominal operations, and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or assets
consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. As such, we were a  shell company 
pursuant to Rule 144 prior to the Share Exchange. The SEC staff has taken the position that Rule 144 is not available for the
resale of securities initially issued by any shell companies (other than business-combination related shell companies) or any
issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC has provided an important exception to this prohibition,
however, if the following conditions are met:  

The
                                         issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;

The
                                         issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d)
                                         of the Exchange Act;    

The
                                         issuer of the securities has filed all reports and materials required to be filed under
                                         Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months
                                         (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials),
                                         other than current reports on Form 8-K; and   

At
                                         least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive
                                         disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.    

As
such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 are not able to be made until a period of at least twelve months has elapsed
from the date we have filed all reports and materials required to be filed under the Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
as applicable, during for 12 months. Therefore, any restricted securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees,
in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered
with the SEC and/or we have filed all reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during for 12 months and we have
otherwise complied with the other requirements of Rule 144. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay
our consultants with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of
debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause us to expend additional
resources in the future. Lastly, any shares held by affiliates, including shares received in any registered offering, will be
subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144(i).  

Insiders
have substantial control over us, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control even if our other stockholders
want it to occur.   

Mr.
Chunfeng Tao, our Chairman and President, owns 100% of the equity of Delight Reward Limited. Delight Reward Limited holds 84%
of our Common Stock. Accordingly, Mr. Tao (who indirectly controls approximately 84% of our Common Stock) is able to control all
matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur.  

There
may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their securities and the market
price of our Common Stock may be volatile.   

There
is currently only a limited public market for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that a trading market will develop
further or be maintained in the future. The market price of our Common Stock has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile,
as is the stock market in general. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our Common Stock are beyond
our control, such as changes in financial estimates by industry and securities analysts, conditions or trends in the industry
in which we operate or sales of our Common Stock. Additionally, on April 1, 2013 trading in our Common Stock was halted by Nasdaq
Stock Market and on October 5, 2013, our Common Stock was delisted from Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, our stock is currently
trading on the OTC Pink. Our stock experienced significant pressure after these events.  

These
factors and the events listed above may materially adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our performance.
In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly
affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the
specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.  

Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.   

Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (the   FINRA  ) has adopted rules that require that a broker-dealer when recommending
an investment to a customer, must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior
to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts
to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under
interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not
be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their
customers buy our Common Stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our Common
Stock. Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker-dealers
may be willing to make a market in our Common Stock, which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.  

Our
Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Markets and is subject to the  Penny Stock  rules.   

Broker-dealer
practices in connection with transactions in  penny stocks  are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the SEC.
Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price per share of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on some
national securities exchanges or quoted on the over-the-counter markets). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior
to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that
provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must
provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
salesperson in the transaction, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact
and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each
penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than
established customers and  accredited investors  must make a special written determination that the penny stock is
a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. Should a
broker-dealer be required to provide the above disclosures or fail to deliver such disclosures on the execution of any transaction
involving a penny stock in violation of federal or state securities laws, an investor may be able to cancel his or her purchase
and get the money back. In addition, if the stocks are sold in a fraudulent manner, the purchaser may be able to sue the
persons and firms that caused the fraud for damages. If an investor has signed an arbitration agreement, however, the investor
may have to pursue the claim through arbitration. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level
of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules, and investors in our Common
Stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.  

Because
we became public by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.   

Since
we became public through a  reverse merger,  our Common Stock issued in connection with the  reverse merger 
and the private placement are restricted shares. As a result, our Common Stock will continue to be very thinly traded after
the reverse merger, until a considerable number of such shares are registered in an effective registration statement or become
sellable under Rule 144 if all of the conditions in Rule 144(i)(2) are satisfied at the time of the proposed sale. Therefore,
securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our Company since there is little incentive to brokerage
firms to recommend the purchase of our Common Stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary
offerings on behalf of the Company in the future.  

In
addition, with one stockholder that owns approximately 84% of our Common Stock, it significantly reduces the amount of shares
to be traded if that stockholder does not sell.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

We
may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.  

In
2014, Jiujiang Jianan Petrochemicals Engineering Co., Ltd. (  Jiujiang Jianan  ) filed a suit against
Ningbo Keyuan in the Beilun District People s Court. Jiujiang Jianan and Ningbo Keyuan are parties to certain service
contract pursuant to which Jiujiang Jianan performed maintenance to Ningbo Keyuan s production equipment. Jiujiang
Jianan claimed it had provided additional services and thus was entitled to additional service fee from Ningbo Keyuan. On July
27, 2016, the Beilun District People s Court issued a judgment that Ningbo Keyuan should pay construction fee of RMB
9.0 million (approximately $1.4 million) plus an interest of RMB 0.8 million (approximately $0.1 million) to Jiujiang Jianan.
Ningbo Keyuan appealed to the Ningbo City Intermediate People s Court on August 8, 2016. The case is currently under
the review by the Ningbo Intermediate People s Court.  

In May 2015, Taihua Plastic (Ningbo) Co.,
Ltd (  Taihua  ) filed a complaint against Ningbo Keyuan and Zhongkexuneng in the Ningbo Intermediate People s
Court. Pursuant to a sale agreement between Taihua and Zhongkexuneng, Taihua made a payment of approximately RMB 29.7 million
(approximately $4.8 million) to Zhongkexuneng for styrene. Taihua claimed damages in the amount of RMB 29.7 million, along with
interest of RMB 0.8 million (approximately $0.1 million) and deductible VAT (as defined herein below) of RMB 4.7 million (approximately
US$0.7 million). On June 24, 2016, the Ningbo Intermediate People s Court ruled that Zhongkexuneng should return the payment
of RMB 29.7 million (approximately $4.8 million) to Taihua, plus the interest; and Ningbo Keyuan should be jointly liable to such
payment as a shareholder of Taihua. Ningbo Keyuan appealed to the Zhejiang Higher People s Court on July 11, 2016 claiming
of its limited liability as a shareholder of a corporation. The case is currently under the trial. 

On March 25, 2016, the Sixth Chemical Engineering
Construction Co., Ltd (  the Sixth  ) brought a suit against Ningbo Keyuan in the Beilun District People s
Court. The Sixth was a contractor who was supposed to build one of Ningbo Keyuan facilities. Completion of the construction was
delayed for several months by the Sixth resulting in our loss of approximately RMB 30.4 million (approximately $4.7 million). The
Sixth claimed that Ningo Keyuan owed a remaining contractual payment of RMB 24.8 million (approximately $3.8 million) plus the
penalties of breach of the contract. In July 2016, Ningbo Keyuan filed a counter claim alleging that the Sixth had breached the
contract by delaying the completion of the construction and requesting a total compensation of RMB 30.4 million (approximately
$4.7 million) from the Sixth. A hearing is to be scheduled by the Beilun District People s Court. 

In
July 2016, Mr. Zongdong Hu filed a labor dispute in Beilun District Ningbo City Labor Arbitration Department claiming a compensation
of RMB 0.5 million (approximately $0.08 million). Mr. Hu was a former vice general engineer at Ningbo Keyuan. Ningbo Keyuan decided
not to grant Mr. Hu certain amount of cash reward based on the evaluation of his performance in accordance with his employment
agreement. Mr. Hu disagrees with our decision. The arbitration is currently pending.  

Other
than as set forth herein, we are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of
any pending or threatened legal or administrative proceedings against us.

Effective
August 11, 1993, the SEC adopted Rule 15g-9, which established the definition of a  penny stock,  for purposes relevant
to the Company, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less
than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:
(1) that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and (2) that the broker or dealer
receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to
be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must (1) obtain financial
information and investment experience and objectives of the person; and (2) make a reasonable determination that the transactions
in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be
capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction
in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form,
(1) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (2) states that the broker or dealer
received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks
of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading, and about commissions payable to both the broker-dealer
and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor
in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.  

Dividend
Policy   

On
January 27, 2011, our Board of Directors approved the distribution of an annual cash dividend of $0.36 per share for 2011 to be
paid quarterly to its Common Stock stockholders at the assigned dates of record. Management agreed to waive their rights to receive
cash dividends with regards to Common Stock indirectly owned by them. In addition, Dragon State agreed to waive their rights to
receive cash dividends should they choose to convert their Series B preferred stock before the record date. The first quarterly
dividend of $0.09 per share was made to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2011, and it was paid on April 15, 2011. The second
quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share was made to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2011, and it was paid on July 15, 2011.
In October 2011, our Board of Directors suspended the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our Common Stock while we pursue
strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, taking the Company private, a merger or other transaction, which we continue
to pursue.

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited
consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion
contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described
in the  Risk Factors  section of this report and the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.   

Overview  

Operating
through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ningbo Keyuan, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers, Zhongkexuneng and
Guangxi Keyuan, our operations include (1) a production facility with an annual petrochemical production capacity of 720,000 MT
of a variety of petrochemical products, (2) a SBS production facility with a designed annual production capacity of 70,000 MT,
(3) a SEBS production facility with a designed annual production capacity of 10,000 MT, (4) facilities for the storage and loading
of raw materials and finished goods and (5) manufacturing technologies that can support our manufacturing process with relatively
low raw material costs and high utilization and yields.  

In
addition, we are working on an expansion including the Guangxi Project (as described in Item 1 Business above), a transformer
oil facility, an increased annual design capacity of ethylene-styrene, and additional storage capacity. Upon full completion of
our expansion, our total production capacity will reach 1,270,000 MT per year comprised of our current petrochemical production
of 720,000 MT, a SBS of 70,00 MT, a SEBS of 10,000 MT, additional styrene of 120,000 MT, catalytic cracking oil of 200,000 MT,
ABS of 50,000 MT, and transformer oil of 100,000 MT.  

Our
Facility and Equipment   

Facility   

As
of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we have invested a total of approximately $3.4 million and $33.7 million in the construction
and improvement of our production facility.  

We
were granted land use rights for 2.5 million square feet land in Ningbo, China where our current production facilities locate.
We were granted land use rights for 4.7 million square feet land in Guangxi, China for the Guangxi Project.  

Our
production facilities are set forth in the table below.  

Facilities
for Petrochemical Products    

(1)    We
                                         use industrial standard designed manufacturing capacity based on equipment and facility.
                                         In the case that a facility is operated efficiently, the actual production can exceed
                                         the standard calculation of designed manufacturing capacity.    

Facilities
for Rubber Products    

(1)    Our
                                         SBS facility was completed in September 2011. It currently has two production lines in
                                         commercial production. SBS generally has a higher product margin compared to petrochemical
                                         products we are producing and a wide range of applications in the footwear, adhesive,
                                         polymer modification and modified asphalt industries.    

(2)    Our
                                         SEBS facility started full production in fiscal year 2014.    

We have a total of 134,000 MT
of storage capacity, consisting of 84,000 MT of storage capacity for raw materials and  50,000
MT for finished products. As a part of our expansion plan, we intend to add additional 16,000 MT of new storage capacity
which is now under construction and expected to be completed in the fourth quarter  of 2016.  

We
own an on-site ocean shipping dock with 50,000 MT of shipping capacity and a 10-truck loading capacity next to our production facility
in Ningbo, China. Approximately 90% of our feedstock and finished products use this shipping dock. We are currently upgrading
the classification of our own dock so that we can unload foreign cargo vessels under the 50,000 MT cargo capacity to our dock
directly. We expect that the upgrade will be completed by the end of 2017 and we will be able to unload certain cargoes directly
rather paying a third party to do so.  

Our Guangxi Project is located in Fangchengang
city, an important port for Guangxi province, and other than Beihai, the only major Chinese port on the Tonkin Gulf. The storage
and logistics costs are generally lower in Fanchengang city compared to other ports in China. 

Equipment   

Our
major processing equipment includes the following:  

Heavy
oil catalytic pyrolysis processing equipment: risers/generators/precipitators, fuel gas boilers, fractionating tower, absorbing,
re-absorbing, and desorbing towers, heat exchangers, pumps, and a stabilizing tower;    

Gas
    fractionation processing equipment-de-propanizing tower, refining propylene tower, de-ethanizination tower, heat exchangers,
    and pumps;   

Ethylbenzene
processing equipment- alkylation reactor, anti-alkylation reactor, dehydrogenation reactor, propylene absorbing tower, de-ethylene
tower, ethylbenzene recovering tower, heating furnace for benzene, heating furnace for gas, steam overheating furnace, tail gas
compressor, and washing tower; and    

Liquefied
    petroleum gas (LPG) and sulfur recovery processing equipment: LPG desulfurization extraction tower, dry gas desulfurization
    tower, regenerating tower, and LPG de-mecaptan extraction tower.   

Expansion
Plan   

The
total estimated cost of our expansion plan is approximately $372.5 million, including $300 million for the Guangxi Project, $30
million for the transformer oil facility, $40 million for the increased annual design capacity of ethylene-styrene, and $2.5 million
for additional storage capacity.  

Our
current estimate of our expansion schedule is as follows. However, we are continuing our evaluation of the timeline for the expansion
projects based on our financial situation and market conditions.  

(1)  
      The Construction of the ABS facility and installation
of main equipment and pipelines is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 and production is expected to be started by the
end of 2018.   

Going
concern and management s plans   

For
the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported net loss of approximately $60.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015,
net cash used in operating activities was $112.5 million. At December 31, 2015, we had  working capital deficits of
approximately $284.6 million.  

Although we continue to finance our operations
primarily through short-term bank borrowings and management s realignment of product profiles, along with the general stabilization
of the petrochemical industry in China, our operations resulted in a net loss of $60.5 million in 2015 compared to a net loss of
$47.1 million in 2014 and a net profit of $4.6 million in 2013. 

Short-term
bank borrowings and notes payable amounted to approximately $695 million at December 31, 2015.  

These matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern.   

Management expects that short-term bank borrowings will continue
to be available through the following 12 months from the date of this report. Since we have not defaulted on previous short-term
bank borrowings, we believe the good credit history will allow us to renew our short-term bank borrowing when they mature. Furthermore,
management expects that the petrochemical industry in China will continue to stabilize, and that demand for downstream products
(such as auto, home appliances and dyes) will grow after several years of contraction. As such, management expects that the Company
will resume profitability in the next few years. 

As reported in our financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we continue to benefit from favorable PRC tax policies related to consumption
tax. As of December 31, 2015, we had  consumption tax recoverable of approximately $44.4 million.
 As of July 31, 2016, all outstanding
tax recoverable as of December 31, 2015 was refunded.  

We believe that the Company s cash, working capital and access
to cash through its bank loans, assuming they will remain available to us through the following 12 months from the date of this
report, provide adequate capital resources to fund its operations and working capital needs through at least 12 months from the
date of this report. 

We are also exploring sources of
additional financing, including short-term financing from our vendors and other parties and potential equity financing if the
terms are acceptable to us. In addition, we are closely monitoring our cash balance, cash needs and expense levels. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management s ability to implement our expansion plan, obtain
additional capital and generate net income and positive cash flows from operations. There can be no assurance that these
plans will be sufficient or that additional financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to us,
if at all.  

Manufacturing
and Sales   

Our total production of finished products during
the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 534,597 MT and 605,488 MT, respectively. Our revenue totaled $474 million and
$653 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, based on the sale of 569,748 MT and 882,571 MT of petrochemical
products and synthetic rubbers, respectively. The decrease in total production of finished products and revenues in fiscal year
2015 was mainly due to an 85-day production suspension. We did not have any production suspension during the fiscal year 2014. 

During the first and second quarter of 2015,
operation of Ningbo Keyuan and Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers was suspended for 85 days in connection with continuing depressed oil price
in international markets occurring in June 2014 which materially negatively impacted us and our downstream distributors. As a result,
we did not have enough capital to satisfy the unsustainable cash demand to maintain operations. We resumed operations in April
2015 when we observed the recovery and stabilization of oil market. During the suspension, we conducted routine maintenance of
facility which is required every two years and requires a temporary suspension of production. As a result of the suspension, our
total production of finished products for the fiscal year 2015 was decreased by approximately 71,000 MT and revenue for the fiscal
year 2015 was decreased by approximately $179 million compared to the total production of finished products and revenue for the
fiscal year 2014, respectively. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
  Group  ). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such
estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of fixed assets; the fair value determination of financial and equity
instruments; the ability to realize inventories; the recoverability of long-lived assets; the collectability of receivables
and the realization of deferred tax assets. These estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that
management believes to be reasonable but inherently uncertain and unpredictable.  

We
believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:  

Inventories.
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted-average cost method. Written-downs
are made for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable
value. Management continually evaluates the recoverability based on assumptions about customer demand and market conditions. If
actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
The Group recorded $4.4 million and $1.2 million for slow-moving and obsolete inventory as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The Group did not record any written-down for slow-moving and obsolete inventory for fiscal year 2015 in this report.  

Property,
Plant and Equipment.  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, taking into consideration the assets  estimated residual value. When
items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between the net book value and proceeds
received thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  

The
estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are listed as follows:  

Buildings   
      45 years   
 
      Plant, machinery and equipment  
      5 to 20 years   
 
      Vehicles  
      5 years   
 
      Office equipment and furniture  
      3 to 10 years   

Construction-in-progress
is stated at cost. Cost comprises of nonrefundable prepayments and direct costs of construction as well as interest costs capitalized
during the period of the construction of the plant or installation of equipment. Costs included in construction in progress are
transferred to their respective categories of property, plant and equipment when the assets are ready for their intended use,
at which time depreciation commences.  

Long-Lived
Assets.  The Group reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets on a periodic basis in order to identify business conditions
that may indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for potential impairment is based primarily on the Group s ability
to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future discounted cash flows. If the total of the expected
future discounted cash flows is less than the total carrying value of the assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between
the fair value (computed based upon the expected future discounted cash flows) and the carrying value of the assets.  

Notes
Receivable.  For certain major customers, the Group accepts their payment for the Group s products by notes receivable.
Notes receivable represent short-term notes receivable issued either by the customer or by the customer and an accepting bank
that entitles the Group to receive the full face amount from the customer or the accepting bank at maturity, which is generally
six months from the date of issuance. Notes receivable are typically sold at a discount prior to maturity, and the discount is
included in interest expense. Historically, the Group has experienced no loss on notes receivable from the default of counterparties.  

Notes
Payable.  Notes payable represent bills issued by accepting banks in favor of the Group s suppliers. The Group s
suppliers receive payments from the accepting banks directly upon maturity of the bills, and the Group is obliged to repay the
face value of the bills to the accepting banks. Bills that are not remitted directly by the Group to its suppliers may be sold
by the Group to other accepting banks for cash prior to their maturity. Discounts paid are recorded as a component of interest
expense.  

Revenue
Recognition . The Group derives its revenue primarily from the sale of petrochemical and rubber products. In accordance
with the provisions of the FASB ASC Topic 605, revenue is recognized only when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenues
are considered to have been earned when the entity has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits
represented by the revenues. The Group recognizes revenue when the products are delivered and customers take ownership and assume
risks of losses, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales
price is fixed or determinable. Written sales agreements, which specify price, product, and quantity, are generally used as evidence
of arrangements. Customer acceptance is generally evidenced by a carrier signed shipment notification form.  

In
the PRC, value added tax (  VAT  ) of 17% on invoiced amounts is collected on behalf of the tax authorities.
Revenue is recorded net of VAT. VAT paid for purchases, net of VAT collected from customers, is recorded in  other current
assets  in the consolidated balance sheets.  

Share-Based
Compensation.  The Group accounts for share-based payments under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock
Compensation . Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the Group measures the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the costs over the period the employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period.  

The Group accounts for equity instruments issued
to non-employee vendors in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Subtopic 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees .
All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair
value of the equity instrument issued. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is the date on
which the counterparty s performance is completed. 

Income
Taxes.  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the carrying amount of deferred
income tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred income tax assets will not
be realized.  

The
Group recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not will be sustained. Recognized
income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% possibility of being realized. Changes in recognition
or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Group has elected to classify interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management does not anticipate any potential
future adjustments in the next twelve months that would result in a material change to its tax positions. For periods presented,
the Group did not incur any interest and penalties.  

Contingencies.    In
the normal course of business, the Group is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of
its business. An accrual for a loss contingency is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated.

The
following analysis set forth information from our statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and
2013 (unless otherwise stated, amounts in thousands, except production and per MT amounts):  

Sales:   Our sales for the year
ended December 31, 2015 were $474,360 compared to sales of $653,497 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $179,137
or 27.4%. The decrease in our sales is a result of an 85-day production suspension in connection with the continuingly depressed
oil price in international markets occurring in June 2014, which had materially negatively impacted us and our downstream distributors.
As a result, we then did not have enough capital to satisfy the unsustainable cash demand to maintain operation. The sales for
the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to sales of $646,549 for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $6,948 or 1.1%,
which was not significant. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015,
we sold 596,748 MT of petrochemical products at an average price of $0.83 per MT compared to sales of 882,571 MT of petrochemical
products at the average price of $0.74 per MT in the fiscal year 2014. This represents a reduction of 312,823 MT, or a decrease
of approximately 35.4% in sold products. The decrease was mainly due to the production suspension for 85 days in 2015 and the
decreased market demands for our products despite that the average sales price in 2015 increased as a result of the stabilization
of global oil price in 2015. We did not suspend our operation during the fiscal year 2014. The increase in the average sales price
in 2015 was mainly due to the stabilization of global oil price in 2015 compared to the continuingly depressed international oil
price in second half year of 2014.  

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we
sold 882,571 MT of petrochemical products at an average price of $0.74 per MT compared to 529,957 MT of petrochemical products
sold at the average price of $1.17 per MT in the fiscal year 2013. This represents an increase of 116,796 MT, or an increase of
approximately 40.0% in sold products. The increase was mainly due to the completion of our oil catalytic cracking processing facility
in late 2014 which can improve the stability and efficiency of projection production of heavy oil to 200,000 MT of heavy oil per
year and the increased demands for our products due to the market change despite that the average sales price decreased in 2014.
The significant decrease in the average sales price was mainly in connection with the continuingly depressed oil price in international
markets occurring in June 2014. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015,
we produced 31,707 MT of finished SBS products at an average sale price of $1.86 per MT generating sales of $58,975. During the
year ended December 31, 2014, we produced 13,821 MT of finished SBS products at the average sale price of $1.59 per MT generating
total sales of $21,943. Our sales for SBS products for the fiscal year 2015 increased by $37,032 or 168.8% compared to the sales
of SBS products for the fiscal year 2014. The reason for the increase in finished SBS products is that we became more experienced
in SBS production and were able to further stabilize the facility operating conditions, reduce interruptions and increase the output
during the fiscal year 2015. 

During the year ended December 31, 2014,
we produced 13,821 MT of finished SBS products at an average sale price of $1.59 per MT generating sales of $21,943. During the
year ended December 31, 2013, we produced 36,959 MT of finished SBS products at the average sale price of $2.11 per MT generating
total sales of $77,984. Our sales for SBS products for the fiscal year 2014 decreased by $56,041 or 71.9% compared to sales of
SBS products for the fiscal year 2013. The main reason for the decrease is due to the change in market conditions and decreased
demands of SBS products. 

We started full production of SEBS in 2014.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 2,207 MT of finished SEBS products at an average sale price of $2.3 per MT, generating
sales of $5,098. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 1,445 MT of SEBS products at an average price of $2.7 per MT
generating sales of $3,919. The increase of SEBS products we sold during the fiscal year 2015 was mainly because we started producing
SEBS in fiscal year 2014 and thus, did not full capacity in 2014. The change of the average sale price was caused by the change
in market price and the decrease in raw material prices for producing SEBS. 

The breakdown  of products produced for the year s
ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is listed below.   

Cost
of Sales:   Our cost of sales are primarily composed of the costs of direct raw materials (mainly heavy oil, benzene and
carbinol), labor cost, depreciation and amortization of manufacturing equipment and facilities, and other overhead.  

Cost of sales was $446,442 for the year ended
December 31, 2015, or 94% of sales, compared to cost of sales of $659,353, or 101% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014,
a decrease of $212,911 or 32.29%. The decrease in cost of sales in 2015 is mainly due to the 85-day production suspension in connection
with the continuingly depressed oil price in international markets occurring in June 2014, which materially negatively impacted
us and our downstream distributors. As a result, we then did not have enough capital to satisfy the unsustainable cash demand to
maintain operation. 

Cost
of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $659,353 compared to cost of sales of $620,040, or 96% of sales for the year
ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $39,313 or 6.34%. The increase in cost of sales in 2014 is mainly due to 41 days of production
suspension in 2013.  

In
addition to primary components of cost of sales listed above, our cost of sales includes energy costs. Energy required for our
production consists of water, electricity and steam, the costs of which are attributed to cost of sales rather than operating
expense. Historically prices of these energy sources in China have been very stable as a result of PRC governmental policy. Accordingly,
the potential impact of changes in energy costs to cost of sales is minimal. The following are the costs for water, electricity
and stream for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (amounts in thousands except production and per metric ton amounts):  

Total energy cost was approximately $20,4 75
for the year ended December 31, 2015, which constitutes approximately 4.3% of sales. Total energy cost was approximately $13,027
for the year ended December 31, 2014 which constitutes approximately 2.0% of sales. Total energy cost was approximately $16,292
for the year ended December 31, 2013, which constitutes approximately 2.52 % of sales.  

Gross Profit (loss):   Gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $27,918 compared to gross loss of $5,856 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The
increase of $33,774 in gross profit in fiscal year 2015 is due to the stabilization of international oil price in 2015 compared
to 2014. The increase in average sales price in 2015 has resulted in a better gross profit compared to 2014. 

Gross loss for the year ended December 31, 2014
was $5,856 compared to gross profit of $26,509 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease of $32,365 in gross profit
in 2014 is due to the overall petrochemical market deterioration in 2014, which caused a continuing decrease in prices of both
finished products and raw material. 

Operating Expenses:   Operating
expenses include selling expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses were $37,719, or 8.0 % of sales
for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $13,219, or 2.0% of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, an increase
of $24,500. The increase is mainly due to the increase in bad debt provision provided for in our accounts receivables and our prepayment
to suppliers of $22,151 in 2015. The bad debt provision was mainly due to canceled orders caused by change in market conditions
which led to decrease in product demand. 

Operating expenses were $13,219, or 2.0%
of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $16,299, or 2.5% of sales for the fiscal year 2013, a decrease of $3,080. The
decrease is mainly due to a decrease of $973 in research and development expenses and a decrease of $577 in consulting fee paid
to an external financial consultant in fiscal year 2014 compared to the fiscal year 2013. 

Interest Income and Expense:  
 For the year ended December 31, 2015,
the interest income and expense was approximately $12,231 and $37,983, respectively; compared to interest income and expense of
approximately $10,109 and $26,077 for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. The increased interest income during the
fiscal year 2015 is mainly from the increased pledge bank deposit for the bank borrowing during the fiscal year 2015. The increase in interest expense is mainly due to the increase in average borrowing
interest rate from 3.7% to 4.4% for the fiscal year 2015 comparing to the fiscal year 2014.  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the
interest income and expense was approximately $10,109 and $26,077, respectively; compared to interest income and expense of approximately
$8,422 and $18,809 for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. The increased interest income during the fiscal year 2014
is mainly from the increased pledge bank deposit for the bank borrowing during the fiscal year 2014. The increase in interest
expense is mainly due to the increase in short term loan of $567,525  as
of December 31, 2014 compared to short-term bank loan of $424,436 as of December 31, 2013.  

Net Income/loss:   Net loss
for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $60,502 compared to a net loss of approximately $47,125 for the year ended
December 31, 2014, which was an increase of $13,377 or 28.39%. The increase in net loss for the fiscal year 2015 was mainly due
to the exchange loss of $13,165 from the depreciation of RMB, which caused by the Company s frequent overseas transactions
on the purchase and sales of crude oil as raw materials that were denominated in USD. For instance, the exchange rate for
USD to RMB was 6.12 to 1 on December 31, 2014 compared to 6.49 to 1 on December 31, 2015. Also the decrease in sales
in 2015 due to production suspension contributed to the increase in the net loss for the fiscal year 2015. 

Net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $47,125 compared to a net profit of approximately $4,632 for the year
ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $51,757 or 1117.38%. The decrease in net income was mainly due to the decrease in gross
profit as stated herein above and the exchange loss of $12,784 from the depreciation of RMB, which caused by the Company s
frequent overseas transactions that denominated in USD.   

Foreign
Currency Translation Adjustment:   Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our local currency, RMB, is our functional
currency for Chinese operating entities. Results of operations and cash flow are translated at an average exchange rate during
the corresponding reporting period, and assets and liabilities are translated at unified exchange rate as quoted by the People s
Bank of China at the end of such period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income in the statement of stockholder equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations
on transactions denominated in a currency other than RMB are included in the results of operations as incurred.  

Currency translation adjustments resulting
from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of equity, and amounted
to a loss of $ 2,603 for the year
ended December 31, 2015, a loss of $543 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and a gain of $2,754 for the year ended December
31, 2013, respectively. The amounts in our balance sheets as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, with the exception of equity,
were translated at RMB  6.4936, RMB 6.1190  and RMB  6.1087
 to 1.00 U.S. dollar, respectively. The equity accounts were translated at their historical rates. The average translation
rates applied to income statement accounts for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were RMB 6.2264,
RMB 6.1426  and  RMB 6.1900 , respectively, to 1.00 U.S. dollar.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following table sets forth a summary of our approximate cash flows for the periods indicated:   

Net cash used in operating
activities was $112,456 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $41,460 provided by operating activities for
the same period in 2014. The 
cash used in operating activities is primarily caused by $60,502 in net loss, an increase of $34,967 in consumption tax
refund receivable, increase of $67,762 in prepayment to suppliers and the increase of $71,763 in pledged deposits for
operating activities.  

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $41,460 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $53,093 used in operating activities for the same
period in 2013. The cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease of $34,349 in consumption tax receivable
and a decrease of $5,200 in prepayment to suppliers. We obtained more advances from customer in 2014, which led to the increase
in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014.  

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
$3,396 and $33,668 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities for
the fiscal year 2015 is primarily due to our decreased investments for the construction of infrastructures and facilities as a
result of the slow down of the economy and a decrease in market demands. We are constantly adjusting our expansion plan and operations
in accordance with changes in market conditions. 

Net cash used in investing activities
was approximately $33,668 and $73,341 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net cash used in investing
activities is primarily due to our decreased investments for the construction of infrastructures and facilities considering the
slowdown of economy and decrease in market demands. We made adjustments to our expansion plan according to such changes. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities amounted to $141,100 for fiscal year 2015, as compared to $14,760 used in financing activities for fiscal year
2014. The increase of $126,340 net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2015 is primarily due to the decrease
of $195,301 in short-term bank borrowings in fiscal year 2015.  

Net cash used in
financing activities amounted to $14,760 for 2014, as compared to $115,231 provided by financing activities for 2013. The
decrease of net cash used in financing activities in 2014 is primarily due to the increase in repayment of short-term bank
borrowing and bank notes in year 2014. 

We have entered into short-term loan
agreements with our primary lenders such as Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China. As of December
31, 2015, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately $360,720 outstanding under the loan agreements with maturity dates
from January 2016 to December 2016 and the annual interest rates from 1.9% to 6.9%. As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $567,525 outstanding under the loan agreements with maturity dates from January 2015 to December
2015 and the annual interest rates from 1.0% to 7.5%. As of December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately
$424,436 outstanding under the loan agreements with maturity dates from January 2014 to December 2014 and the annual interest rates
from 1.0% to 7.2%. The loan agreements were mainly guaranteed by third parties and individual persons or secured by a lien on our
property and equipment. Historically, all debts due have been paid back by the Company in a timely manner. All short-term bank
loans are revolving loans, and the lenders generally agree to extend the loans upon maturity if we request. As the date of this
report, we have timely repaid or renewed all short-term bank loans. As of December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31,
2013, we were in compliance with the terms of our loan agreements. As such, management expects outstanding bank loans will be extended
if not paid back upon maturity. Depending on our capital needs, we evaluate whether to apply for additional long-term bank loans.
We currently have sufficient lines of credit with our primary lenders for both short-term and long-term borrowings for our operations.
However, we estimate the total cost of the expansion (as described in Item 1 Business above) will be $372,500. We plan to fund
the expansion through debt financing, cash from operations, and potential equity financing. However, we may not be able to obtain
additional financing at acceptable terms, or at all, and, as a result, our ability to increase our production capacity and to expand
our business could be adversely affected.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and Shareholders  

  of
Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc.  

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc. (the  Company ) as of
December 31, 2014 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in  equity
(deficit) and cash flows for the year s  ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audit s .  

We
conducted our audit s  in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc., as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year s  ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
As discussed in Note 1(c) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring negative net cash
flows used in operations, and has a working capital deficiency at December 31, 2015. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 1(c). The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

series D warrants to purchase 800,001 common shares at a price of $5.25 per share (subject to adjustments). 

On July 11, 2016, the Company entered into a
share purchase and settlement agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with Dragon State, Delight Reward Limited ( Delight
Reward ), Keyuan HK, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Ningbo Keyuan, and Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers (the Company, Keyuan HK, Ningbo
Keyuan Petrochemicals, Ningbo Keyuan and Keyuan Synthetic Rubbers are collectively referred as the  Keyuan Group ),
Tao, and Prax Capital Equity Management Co., Ltd., an affiliated party to Dragon State. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Dragon

Common Stock per share as reported on the OTC Pink during a period commencing on the date of the Settlement Agreement and ending
on August 4, 2016, which was $0.005 per share of Common Stock. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock underlying
the series B preferred stock was, therefore $27,465.01. On August 8, 2016, these funds were paid in cash on hand by Delight Reward.
On August 10, 2016, the shares of Series B preferred stock were converted into 5,493,001 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of the certificate of designations of series B preferred stock and the Side Agreement. 

(c)
Financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources  

For the year 
ended December 31, 2015, the Company reported net loss of approximately $60.5 million and cash flow used in operations of approximately
$112.5 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company had working capital deficit of approximately $284.6 million.  

Although the Company continues to finance
and support its operations primarily through short-term bank borrowings, management s realignment of product profiles, along
with the general stabilization of the petrochemical industry in China, the operations resulted in net loss of $60.5 million in
2015 compared to a net loss of $47. 1
million in 2014 and a net profit of $4.6 million in 2013.  

Short-term bank borrowings and notes payable
amounted to approximately $695 million at December 31, 2015. 

These matters raise substantial doubt
about the company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is  exploring
sources of additional financing, including short-term financing from its vendors, banks, and other parties and equity financing.
In addition, the Company is closely monitoring its cash balances, cash needs and expense levels.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management s ability to implement its strategic
plan, obtain additional capital and generate net income and positive cash flows from operations. There can be no assurance that
these plans will be sufficient or that additional financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if
at all.  

2.          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

(a) Principles
of consolidation and basis of presentation  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and include the financial statements of the Company.  

All
significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.  

(b) Use
of estimates  

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of property, plant and equipment; the fair
value determination of financial and equity instruments; the realizability of inventories; and the recoverability of 
long-lived assets, realization of deferred tax assets and collectability of receivables. These estimates are often based on complex
judgments and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.  

(c) Foreign
currency transactions and translation  

The functional currency of the Company,
Sinotech Group and Keyuan HK is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the PRC operating subsidiaries is the Renminbi ( RMB ).
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at each balance sheet date, and non-monetary items are translated
at historical rates. The resulting exchange differences on these transactions are recorded in foreign exchange gain (loss), net
in the consolidated statements of  operations
and comprehensive loss.  

The
Group s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities of the PRC operating subsidiaries are translated into
the U.S. dollar using the exchange rates at each balance sheet date. The balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2015 and 2014,
with the exception of equity, were translated at RMB  6.4936 and 6.1190  to 1.00
U.S. dollar, respectively. Revenue and expenses of the PRC operating subsidiaries are translated at average rates prevailing during
the reporting period. The average translation rates applied to income statement accounts for the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014 were RMB  6.2264 and 6.1426 , respectively, to 1.00 U.S. dollar. Equity
is translated at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of the PRC operating subsidiaries
into the U.S. dollar are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in equity.  

(d) Cash  

Cash
consists of cash on hand and cash at banks. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, cash of 4.8 million and $0.9 million,
respectively, was held in major financial institutions located in the PRC. Management performs periodic evaluations of the relative
credit standings of those financial institutions, and believes that they have high credit ratings.  

(e) Pledged
bank deposits  

Pledged
bank deposits represent amounts held by financial institutions, which are not available for the Group s use, as security
for issuances of notes payable to the Group s suppliers, or as security for short-term bank borrowings. Upon maturity of
the bills, which generally occurs within three to six months after the issuance of the bills, or upon the repayment of short-term
bank borrowings, the deposits are released by the financial institutions and become available for use by the Group.  Pledged
bank deposits related to the purchase of inventories are reported within cash flows from operating activities and pledged bank
deposits related to short-term bank borrowings are reported within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements
of cash flows.  

(f) Inventories  

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted-average cost method. Written-downs are made for
excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. Management
continually evaluates the recoverability based on assumptions about customer demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions
are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory written-downs may be required. The Group recorded
$4.4 million for slow-moving and obsolete inventory as of December 31, 2014. The Group did not record any written-down for slow-moving
and obsolete inventory for other periods presented in this report.  

(g) Accounts
receivable, net  

With
the approval of the Company s general manager, the Company occasionally extends unsecured credit to its long-term customers
with a good credit rating. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and recorded based on management s assessment
of its analysis of trade receivables, customers  credit-worthiness, past collection history, and changes in customers 
payment records. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when accounts are deemed uncollectible. At December 31, 2015 and 2014,
the Group recorded $1.8 million and nil provision for doubtful accounts made in the consolidated financial statements, respectively.  

(h) Property,
plant and equipment  

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, taking into consideration the assets  estimated residual value. When items are retired or otherwise disposed
of, income is charged or credited for the difference between the net book value and proceeds received thereon.  Ordinary
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  

The
estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:  

Buildings  
      45 years   
 
      Plant, machinery and equipment  
      5 to 20 years   
 
      Vehicles  
      5 years   
 
      Office equipment and furniture  
      3 to 10 years   

Construction-in-progress
is stated at cost. Cost comprises nonrefundable prepayments during the period of the construction of the plant or installation
of equipment. Costs included in construction-in-progress are transferred to their respective categories of property, plant and
equipment when the assets are ready for their intended use, at which time depreciation commences.  

(i)
Long-Lived Assets  

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC )
Topic 360-10, the Group reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets on a periodic basis in order to identify business
conditions, which may indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for potential impairment is based primarily on the Group s
ability to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the total of the
expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the total carrying value of the assets, a loss is recognized for the difference
between the fair value (computed based upon the expected future discounted cash flows) and the carrying value of the assets. No
impairment is believed to exist at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.  

(j)
Land use rights  

Land
use rights represent the exclusive right to occupy and use a piece of land in the PRC for a specified contractual term. Land use
rights are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the land use rights of 15 to 50 years.  

(k) Notes
receivable and notes payable  

The
Group utilizes banker s acceptances in the form of notes receivable and notes payable.  

For
certain major customers, the Group accepts their payments for the Group s products by notes receivable. Notes receivable
represent short-term notes receivable issued either by a customer or by a customer and an accepting bank that entitles the Group
to receive the full face amount from such customer or such accepting bank at maturity, which is generally six months from the
date of issuance. Notes receivable are typically sold at a discount prior to maturity, and the discount is included in interest
expense. Historically, the Group has experienced no losses on notes receivable from the default of counter parties.  

Notes
payable represent bills issued by an accepting bank in favor of the Group s suppliers. The Group s suppliers receive
payments from such accepting bank directly upon maturity of the bills, and the Group is obliged to repay the face value of the
bills to such accepting bank. Bills that are not remitted directly by the Group to its suppliers may be sold by the Group to other
accepting banks for cash prior to their maturity. Discounts paid are recorded as a component of interest expense. Notes payable
with financing nature amounted $312 million and $132 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

(l)
Revenue recognition  

The
Group derives its revenue primarily from the sale of petrochemical products. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic
605, revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenues are considered to have been earned
when the entity has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. The
Group recognizes revenue when the products are delivered and a customer takes ownership and assumes risks of losses, collection
of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable.
Written sales agreements, which specify price, product, and quantity, are generally used as evidence of an arrangement. Customer
acceptance is generally evidenced by a carrier signed shipment notification form.  

In
the PRC, value added tax ( VAT ) of 17% on invoiced amounts, and consumption tax of $190 per ton on certain sales,
are collected on behalf of tax authorities. Revenue is recorded net of VAT and consumption tax. VAT and consumption tax paid for
purchases, net of VAT and consumption tax collected from customers, is recorded in other current assets and consumption tax recoverable,
respectively.  

(m)
Share-based compensation  

The
Group accounts for share-based payments under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation .
Under ASC Topic 718, the Group measures the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the costs over the period the employee is required to provide service
in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period.  

The
Group accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employee vendors in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Subtopic 505-50,
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees . All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for
equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instrument issued. The measurement date for the fair
value of the equity instruments issued is the date on which the counter party s performance is completed.  

(n)
Employee benefit plans  

Pursuant
to relevant PRC regulations, Ningbo Keyuan, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Keyuan synthetic Rubbers, Zhongkexuneng and Guangxi
Keyuan are required to make contributions to various defined contribution plans organized by municipal and provincial PRC governments.
The contributions are made for each PRC employee at rates ranging from 26.7% to 28.7% on a standard salary base as determined
by the local security bureau.  

Contributions to the defined contribution
plans are charged to the consolidated statements of  operations
and comprehensive loss when the related service is provided. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, contributions
to the defined contribution plans were approximately $1 million and $1 million, respectively.  

The
Group has no other obligation for the payment of employee benefits associated with these plans beyond the contributions described
above.  

(o)
Income taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the
asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and operating loss carry forwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets if it is considered
more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2015
and 2014, $ 33.3 million and $20.9
million valuation allowance were provided against deferred tax assets.  

The
Group recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized
income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition
or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Group has elected to classify interest
related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There
were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management does not anticipate any potential
future adjustments in the next twelve months, which would result in a material change to its tax position. For periods presented,
the Group did not incur any interest and penalties.  

(p)
Fair value measurements  

The
Group utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to
the extent possible. The Group determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements,
the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the
following levels:  

Level 1 inputs are
    quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has the ability to access
    at the measurement date.   

Level 2 inputs are
    inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.   

Level 3 inputs are
    unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available,
    thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement
    date.   

The
level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  

(q)
Earnings (loss) per share  

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company s common stockholders by
the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the year.  

Diluted
earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company s stockholders as adjusted
for the effect of dilutive common stock equivalents, if any, by the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive common
stock equivalents outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of the common stock issuable upon the conversion
of the Group s Series B convertible preferred stock (using the if converted method) and common stock issuable upon
the exercise of outstanding stock options and stock purchase warrants (using the treasury stock method). Potential dilutive securities
are not included in the calculation of dilutive earnings (loss) per share if the effect is anti-dilutive. No warrants and options
were included from diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as their effect was
anti-dilutive.  

(r)
Segment reporting  

The
Group s chief operating decision maker has been identified as its Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  

The
Group has two operating segments : the manufacture and sale of petrochemical products ( petrochemical
segment ) and the manufacture and sale of rubber products ( rubber segment ). Substantially all of the Company s
operations and customers are located in the PRC.   

(s)
Contingencies  

In
the normal course of business, the Group is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of
its business. An accrual for a loss contingency is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated.  

(t)
Recent accounting pronouncements  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date . The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for
all entities by one year. ASU No. 2014-09, issued in May 2014, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a
common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Simultaneously, this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC
Topic 605-Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core
principle of this ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify
the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract; (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Public business
entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in this ASU to annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier
application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods
within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position and results
of operations upon adopting these amendments.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) . The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the
guidance. The amendments clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. When another party is involved
in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide
the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided
by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation,
the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified
good or service transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity
recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the
specified good or service to be provided by the other party. An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service
before that good or service is transferred to a customer. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining
whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this ASU affect the
guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in
this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, which is deferred by ASU No. 2015-14
by one year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations upon
adopting these amendments.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments in this ASU affected all entities that issue share-based payment awards
to their employees. The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. For public business entities,
the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing . The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather,
the amendments in this ASU clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing
implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance
in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition
requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any
other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.  

3          INVENTORIES   

Inventories consist of the following:  

4           ADVANCES FROM CUSTOMERS   

The
Group generally requires a prepayment of 100% of the sales contract price from its customers shortly before products are delivered.
Such prepayments are recorded as  advances from customers  in the Group s consolidated balance sheets, until
products are delivered and customers take ownership and assume the risk of loss. Approved by the Company s general manager,
the Company occasionally extends credit to its long-term customers with good credit ratings.  

5           PREPAYMENTS
TO SUPPLIERS   

The
Group makes prepayments to suppliers in connection with purchases of raw materials, which would be settled within the following
twelve months. Prepayments to suppliers are reclassified to inventories or expense and applied to related purchases of materials
after invoices of such purchases are received. Bad debt provision charged to expenses from the prepayments to suppliers were $9.6
million and nil for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The bad debt provision was mainly due to canceled orders caused
by change in market conditions which led to decrease in product demand.  

6           CONSUMPTION
TAX RECOVERABLE   

The PRC government enacted a regulation
pursuant to which domestically purchased heavy oil to be used for producing ethylene and aromatics products was exempted
from consumption tax. In addition, the consumption tax paid for imported heavy oil is to be refunded if it is used for producing
ethylene and aromatics products. Given all the Group s purchased heavy oils are, or are to be, used for producing ethylene
and aromatics products, the Group recognizes a consumption tax recoverable when a consumption tax for heavy oils has been paid
and the relevant heavy oils have been used for producing ethylene and aromatics products. As of December 31, 2015 and December
31, 2014, the Group recorded an estimated consumption tax recoverable amounting to approximately $44.4 million and $11.5 million,
respectively.  As of July 31, 2016,
all outstanding tax recoverable as of December 31, 2015 was refunded.  

7           OTHER
CURRENT ASSETS   

Other
current assets consist of the following:  

Management
estimates the deductible input VAT using vendor contracts, engineering and other estimates, as well as historical experience.  

Customs
deposits for imported inventories represent amounts paid to the local customs office in connection with the import of raw materials
inventories. Upon approval by the customs authorities, these amounts become refundable by the local tax authority and are reclassified
as VAT recoverable or consumption tax recoverable (Note 6). The decrease in 2015 was mainly due to the decrease in purchase and
most VAT recoverable has been utilized before year end.  

8           PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT   

Property,
plant and equipment consist of the following:  

Depreciation
expense on property, plant and equipment is allocated to the following items:  

For
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, interest capitalized amounted to approximately $0.2 million and $1.0
million, respectively.  

9           INTANGIBLE
ASSETS   

Intangible
assets consist of the following:  

Licensing
agreements consist of technology utilization rights for petrochemical and rubber production. For the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014, amortization expense related for intangible assets was approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  

Amortization
expense for each of the five succeeding years is estimated as follows:  

10         LAND
USE RIGHTS   

Land
use rights consist of the following:  

For
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, amortization expense related to land use rights was approximately $0.8 million and
$0.5 million, respectively.  

Amortization
expense for each of the five succeeding years is estimated as follows:  

11         SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS AND LONG TERM DEBTS   

Short-term
bank borrowings consist of the following:  

As
of December 31, 2015, short-term bank borrowings had interesting rates ranging from 1.9% to 6.9% with a weighted average interest
rate of 5.3% in RMB loans and a weighted average interest rate of 2.4% in USD loans maturing from two to twelve months. The loans
were mainly used to support the daily operation of the Company. As of December 31, 2014, short-term bank borrowings had interesting
rates ranging from 1.0% to 7.5% with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% in RMB loans and a weighted average interest rate
of 3.3% in USD loans maturing from two to twelve months.  

A
portion of short-term bank borrowings were either secured by the Group s land, buildings and equipment or pledged by one-year
fixed term deposits, or third party guaranty.  

The
following table sets forth the short-term borrowings from each bank as of December 31, 2015 and 2014,  

Among the Group's short-term borrowing,
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, $109.5 million and $105. 1
million was guaranteed by related party and third-party entities and individuals, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
nil and $21.5 million of the Group s short-term borrowings was secured by the Group s land, buildings and equipment
with a carrying amount of nil and $131.6 million, respectively; and $251.2 million and $440.9 million of the Group s short-term
borrowings was pledged by one-year fixed term deposits with a carrying amount of $130.3 million and $276.7 million, respectively.  

The long term debt of the Company was   signed between Ningbo Keyuan and Zhouji (Group) Co., Ltd ( Zhouji Group ) on April 9, 2015.
The principal of the debt is RMB100 million (approximately $15.4 million). The debt matures at the second anniversary and carries
an interest of 7.0% which is 40% higher than average interest rate of long term bank loans during that period. The long term loan
is secured by 15% of Chunfeng Tao s ownership of Ningbo Keyuan. Upon the maturity of the loan, Zhouji Group has an option
to elect a payment of the principal and the accrued interest or the transfer of 15% of Mr. Tao s ownership of Ningbo Keyuan.  

12         ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER PAYABLES   

Accrued
expenses and other payables consist of the following:  

Other
accruals and payables mainly represent the penalty payable to SEC, the cancellation of share-based compensation and VAT payables.  

13         SERIES
B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED FINANCING AGREEMENTS   

The
significant terms of the Series B convertible preferred stock are as follows:  

Conversion:  

At
any time on or after the issuance date, at the election of the holders, each share of the Series B convertible preferred stock
may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock, at a conversion price of $3.75 per share, subject to certain
ownership limitations and adjustments.  

The
conversion price is subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments, including adjustments for stock splits, dividends and distributions,
and reorganization, merger or consolidation. In addition, the conversion price may be adjusted down.  

The
Series B convertible preferred stock shall be automatically converted into common stock (for the same conversion price as described
above) upon the third year anniversary of the issuance date of the Series B convertible preferred stock on September 28, 2013.
In the event the Company shall issue or sell any additional shares of common stock at a price per share less than the then-applicable
conversion price or without consideration, then the conversion price upon each such issuance shall be reduced to that price (the
 Round Down Provision ). On September 24, 2013, the Company and the sole holder of Series B convertible preferred
stock agreed to extend the automatic conversion date of Series B preferred stock from September 28, 2013 to September 28, 2014
(as described below).  

Management
evaluated the terms and conditions of the embedded conversion features and determined that there was no beneficial conversion
features for the Series B convertible preferred stocks because the effective conversion price is equal to or higher than the fair
value at the date of issuance. Management evaluated the terms and conditions of the embedded conversion features based on the
guidance of ASC 815-15-25-1 (formerly SFAS 133, paragraph 12) to determine if there was an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation.
An embedded derivative instrument (such as a conversion option embedded in the convertible preferred stock) must be bifurcated
from its host instruments and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument only if the  risks and rewards 
of the embedded derivative instrument are not  clearly and closely related  to the risks and rewards of the host instrument
in which it is embedded. Management concluded that the embedded conversion feature of the preferred stock was not required to
be bifurcated because the conversion feature is clearly and closely related to the host instrument, and because of the Company s
limited trading volume that indicates the feature is not readily convertible to cash in accordance with ASC 815-10,  Derivatives
and Hedging .  

Redemption:  

As a result of the Round Down Provision, and in
accordance with ASR 268  Presentation in Financial Statement of Redeemable Preferred Stock , the Series B convertible
preferred stock has been classified as temporary equity as of December 31, 2013, as the Company does not control the events necessary
to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required should the redemption feature be triggered. In the event the Company
has insufficient authorized registered shares of common stock to effect a conversion request from the Series B investors, the
Company, at its sole discretion, may elect to satisfy such conversion request by either redeeming the preferred stock at its liquidation
preference of $3.75 per share, or by issuing restricted shares of the Company s common stock.  

The
Series B convertible preferred stock is redeemable at the option of their holders simultaneously with the occurrence of the following
events:  

(i)
a capital reorganization of the Company (other than by way of a stock split or combination of shares or stock dividends or distributions
or a reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for in the terms of the series B convertible preferred stock),
(ii) merger or consolidation where the holders of the Company s outstanding voting securities prior to such merger or consolidation
do not own over 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the merged or consolidated entity immediately after such merger or
consolidation; or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s properties or assets (collectively, an  Organic
Change ).  

Management
considers the occurrence of the Organic Change is solely within the control of the Company.  

The
Series B convertible preferred stock has no value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 as the current holder, Delight Reward, has
waived all claims and liabilities on the Company.  

Voting
Rights:  

The
Series B convertible preferred stock has no voting rights with the common stock or other equity securities of the Company other
than certain class voting rights, as outlined in its terms.  

Fixed
dividends were accrued and cumulative for one year from the date of the initial issuance of the Series B convertible preferred
stock, and are payable on a quarterly basis. Annual dividends were determined as 6% of $3.75 for each share of the Series B convertible
preferred stock. Fixed dividends are no longer payable on the series B convertible preferred stock.   

Tolling
Agreement:  

The
Company and Dragon State, the sole holder of series B convertible preferred stock and the majority holder of Series C warrants
and Series D warrants, entered into a tolling agreement, dated September 24, 2013 (the  Tolling Agreement ). Pursuant
to the Tolling Agreement, all periods of limitation, repose and laches which are or may be applicable to any or all claims and
remedies at contract, tort and statute, including but not limited to all claims arising out of the securities purchase agreement
dated September 28, 2010 and out of Dragon State s purchase of the securities of the Company, whether described therein
or not (collectively,  Tolled Claims ), that Dragon State has or may have against the Company and its Chairman of
the Board and former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Tao, are tolled and suspended as of September 8, 2013 through and including
September 28, 2014.  

Together
with the Tolling Agreement, the Company and Dragon State agreed to amend certain terms in the certificate of designations, preferences
and rights of Series B convertible preferred stock, Series C warrants and Series D warrants issued in Series B financing in September
2010 (the  Amendments ).  

Pursuant
to the Amendments, i) the date of maturity (a/k/a. the date of mandatory conversion) of series B convertible preferred stock was
extended from September 28, 2013 to September 28, 2014; ii) the term of Series C warrant was extended from three years to four
years; and iii) the term of Series D warrant was extended from three years to four years.  

The
Company considered the fair value of series B convertible preferred stock, Series C warrants and Series D warrants immediately
before and after the Amendments and determined that the Amendments constitute modification of the Series B convertible preferred
stock, Series C warrants and Series D warrants, resulting in the transfer of value from the Company s common shareholders
to Series B preferred stockholders. The estimated fair value of the value transferred is approximately $548,000 and was reflected
as a deemed dividend in the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2013.  

The
fair value was estimated as of September 24, 2013 (date of modification) using the Black Scholes option-pricing model utilizing
the following assumptions: stock price of $0.70 per share; no dividends; a risk free rate of 0.1%, which equals the one-year yield
on treasury bonds at constant (or fixed); and volatility of 126.36%.  

On
October 30, 2014, Dragon State filed a complaint, among others, against the Company and Mr. Chunfeng Tao, seeking rescission of
the securities purchase agreement dated September 28, 2010, and the return of $20 million, and in the alternative, seeking monetary
damages to be determined at a trial but not less than $20 million. Please refer to Note 18 (c) for details. In connection with
the complaint, a consent order was issued by the District Court for the Southern District of New York whereby the Company and
Mr. Chunfeng Tao agreed that the expiration date of the Series B Shares should be tolled pending the resolution of the complaint.
On July 21, 2016, the Complaint was dismissed by the District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with the
execution of a settlement agreement between and among the Company, certain affiliates of the Company, Dragon State and others.
Subsequently, all Series B convertible preferred stock was transferred to additional paid in capital of the Company as at December
31, 2014.According to the settlement agreement, Dragon State transferred all the securities it owned on the Company to Delight
Reward. On August 4, 2016, the Company entered into a side agreement with Delight Reward whereby Delight Reward agreed not to
claim the Series C and Series D warrants were exercisable and agreed to pay for each convertible share underlying the Series B
convertible preferred stock the highest sale price of the Company s Common Stock per share as reported on OTC Pink Marketplace
during a period commencing on the date of the settlement agreement. Thus, the Series C and Series D warrants are considered expired.
The Company has made accounting adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2014 to transfer the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock, Series C and Series D warrants into the additional paid-in capital account and then deduct the additional paid-in capital
by the final consideration of share transfer of RMB 12 million ($1.8 million). Then a non-operation expense of RMB 6 million ($0.9
million) was also booked to waived all claims.  

The
Company considered the fair value of the Series B convertible preferred stock, the Series C warrants and the Series D warrants
immediately before and after the Amendments and determined that the Amendments constitute modification of the Series B convertible
preferred stock, the Series C warrants and the Series D warrants, resulting in the transfer of value from the Company s
common shareholders to the Series B preferred shareholders. The estimated fair value of the value transferred was not significant.  

Escrow
shares agreement:  

In
connection with the Series B financing, the Company entered into an escrow share agreement with the representatives of the Series
B investors, Delight Reward (the majority owner of the Company), and Anslow   Jaclin, LLP (the  Escrow Agreement ),
pursuant to which 3,400,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Escrow Shares ) held by Delight Reward were
delivered to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Shares were to be released back to Delight Reward upon the Company s achievement
of no less than 95% of a net income of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the  Performance Threshold ).
The Performance Threshold was achieved and the 3,400,000 shares were released on November 6, 2013.  

14         COMMON
STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS   

In
conjunction with the Company s Series A and Series B financings, the Company previously issued the following warrants to
purchase the Company s common stock:  

Series
A warrants and Series B warrants, including placement agent warrants issued in the Series A financing, expired in 2013.  

Series
C warrants and Series D warrants, including placement agent warrants issued in the Series B financing, were considered expired
on or about the date of the side agreement (as described in Note 13 above).

the grant date, 40% shall vest and become exercisable two years after the grant date and 30% shall vest and become exercisable
three years after the grant date. On December 29, 2010, 600,000 of these stock options were cancelled. As compensation for such
cancellation, the Company committed to pay these employees incremental cash payments during the period through August 2013. The
fair value of the committed cash payment at the date of commitment was approximately $0.4 million and no incremental compensation
cost resulted from the cancellation of these stock options.

10% of their after tax profits as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC to a statutory surplus
reserve until the reserve balances reach 50% of their respective registered capitals. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31,

the fiscal year 2014, the Company repurchased 298,962 shares for approximately $306,852. No common stock was repurchased during
the fiscal year 2015.

balance sheets. Treasury shares may be reissued as part of the Company s stock-based compensation programs. There were no
reissuances during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Litigation  

On
November 15, 2011, the Company and several of its officers were named in a securities class action, alleging violation of federal
securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading statements and omitting material facts with regard to disclosure of
related party transactions and effectiveness of internal controls in past public filings.  On August 26, 2013, the case
was transferred to the Southern District of New York. An Order and Final judgement was entered on October 9, 2015. The case is
now dismissed.  

On July 2, 2013, the United District Court

Commission. The settlement was reached on February 28, 2013 in a case filed by the SEC in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia against us, alleging the Company s violation of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities
Act, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder. Under the terms

Consent Order was issued by the Court whereby the Company and Mr. Chunfeng Tao agree that, notwithstanding anything contained in
the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the contrary, the 5,333,334
shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by Dragon State have not been, and shall not be, automatically converted into shares of
Company s common stock, or any other security prior to the resolution of the above mentioned action; and the expiration of
Series C and Series D warrants shall be tolled pending the resolution of the above mentioned action as well. 

On
October 28, 2014, Dragon State initiated a litigation against the Company, Mr. Chunfeng Tao, and Aichun (Angela) Li in the Court,
alleging that the Company and Mr. Chunfeng Tao had violated the securities laws, made material misrepresentations, and breach
their duties under the September 28, 2010 Securities Purchase Agreement between Dragon State and the Company. In connection with
the complaint, a consent order was issued by the District Court for the Southern District of New York whereby the Company and
Mr. Chunfeng Tao agreed that the expiration date of the Series B convertible preferred stock should be tolled pending the resolution
of the complaint. On July 11, 2016, the Company and certain affiliates of the Company entered into a share purchase and settlement
agreement with Dragon State and others (the  Settlement Agreement ), pursuant to which, Dragon State agreed to transfer
the securities of the Company it owned to Delight Reward Limited, a British Virgin Islands company and the controlling shareholder
of the Company ( Delight Reward ) and waive all claims and liabilities that Dragon State or its affiliated companies
or individuals had brought or would bring against the Company, Delight Reward and certain affiliates of the Company for an aggregate
consideration of RMB 18 million or equivalent U.S. dollars. The Settlement Agreement provided that the purchase price for the
transfer of the securities pursuant to the Settlement Agreement was RMB 12 million.  

On
August 4, 2016, the Company has entered into a side agreement with Delight Reward in connection with the execution of a settlement
agreement and the payment subsequently made thereunder by the Company to Dragon State. Dragon State agreed to transfer the securities
of the Company it owned to Delight Reward and waive all claims and liabilities that Dragon State or its affiliated companies or
individuals had brought or would bring against the Company, Delight Reward and certain affiliates of the Company, for an aggregate
consideration of RMB 18 million or the equivalent in U.S. dollars.  

Under
the Side Agreement, Delight Reward agreed to pay to the Company for each Convertible Share the highest sale price of the Company s
Common Stock per share as reported on the OTC Pink during a period commencing on the date of the Settlement Agreement, which was
$0.005 per share of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $27,465.01. Delight Reward also agreed in the Side Agreement
not to claim, or attempt to claim for any reason and in any circumstance, that the Warrants are exercisable.  

19         INCOME
TAXES   

The
Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.  

The
United States of America   

The
Company is incorporated in the State of Nevada in the U.S., and is subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax at progressive
rates ranging from 15% to 35%. The state of Nevada does not impose any state corporate income tax.  

British
Virgin Islands   

Sinotech
Group is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI ). Under the current laws of the BVI, Sinotech Group is
not subject to tax on income or capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by Sinotech Group, no BVI withholding tax
is imposed.  

Hong
Kong   

Keyuan
HK is incorporated in Hong Kong. Keyuan HK did not earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong for the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2014, and therefore was not subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax. The payments of dividends by Hong Kong companies are
not subject to any Hong Kong withholding tax.  

PRC   

Ningbo
Keyuan, Ningbo Keyuan Petrochemicals, Keyuan synthetic Rubbers, Zhongkexuneng and Guanxi Keyuan are all incorporated in the PRC
and the applicable PRC statutory income tax rate for these companies is 25% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. On
June 30, 2014, the local tax authorities granted Guangxi Keyuan the qualification to enjoy the Western Development Enterprise
Preferential Tax Policy, which is a 15% income tax rate from the first year when Guangxi Keyuan generate revenue to year 2020.
The Company expects Guangxi Keyuan to generate revenue in 2018.  

Components of loss before income tax expense  consist
of the following jurisdictions:  

The Group s income tax expense in the consolidated statements
of  operations and comprehensive loss
consists of the following:  

Reconciliation
between income tax expense and the amounts computed by applying the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% to income (loss) before
income taxes is as follows:  

The PRC income tax rate has been used because
the majority of the Group s consolidated  loss
before income taxes arises in the PRC.  

The
tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred income tax assets are presented below:  

Deferred tax assets arising from net operating
loss carry forwards ( NOL S ) from the Group s operations outside of the PRC were approximately $8.2 million
and $7.5 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Management has determined that the Group may
not generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions to realize the deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance
was provided. As of  December 31,
2015, NOL S and their expiration dates arose in the following jurisdictions:  

According
to the prevailing PRC income tax law and its relevant regulations, non-PRC-resident enterprises are levied withholding tax at
10%, unless reduced by tax treaties or similar arrangements, on dividends from their PRC-resident investees for earnings accumulated
beginning on January 1, 2008, and undistributed earnings generated prior to January 1, 2008 are exempted from such withholding
tax. Further, the Group s distributions from its PRC subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax at 34%, less any
applicable qualified foreign tax credits. Due to the Group s policy of reinvesting permanently its earnings in its PRC business,
the Group has not provided for deferred income tax liabilities for U.S. federal income tax purposes on its PRC subsidiaries 
undistributed loss of $33 million and undistributed earnings of $9 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  

For
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Group did not have unrecognized tax benefits, and therefore no interest or
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were accrued. Management does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
will change significantly within the next twelve months.  

The
Group mainly files income tax returns in the United States and the PRC. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax examination
by tax authorities for tax years beginning in 2010.  According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the
statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the
withholding agent. The statute of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances where the underpayment of
taxes is more than RMB100,000 ($15,000). In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitations is ten years. There
is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion. The PRC tax returns for the Company s PRC subsidiaries are open
to examination by the PRC state and local tax authorities for the tax years beginning in 2008.  

20          LOSS
PER SHARE     

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic  and diluted net loss per share:    

21         FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

The
Company did not have any assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively.  

The
fair values of cash, pledged bank deposits, notes receivable, accounts receivable, short-term bank borrowings, notes payable,
and accounts payable approximate their respective carrying amounts due to their short-term nature. Amounts due to/from related
parties are not practicable to estimate due to the related party nature of the underlying transactions.  

22         SIGNIFICANT
CONCENTRATIONS AND RISKS   

As
of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Group held cash and pledged bank deposits in financial institutions of approximately
$288 million and $349 million, respectively. They were primarily held in major financial institutions located in mainland China
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which management believes have high credit ratings.  

During the year s
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, no sales to individual customer exceeded 10% of the Group s total net revenues. At December
31, 2015, three customers accounted for 42%, 38% and 18% of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2014, three customers accounted
for 29%, 26% and 22% of accounts receivable.  

The
Group currently buys a majority of its heavy oil, an important component of its products, from three suppliers. Although there
are a limited number of suppliers of a particular heavy oil used in production, management believes that other suppliers could
provide similar heavy oil on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible
loss of sales, which would affect operating results adversely. Purchases (net of VAT) from the largest three suppliers for the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $308.3 million and $609.7 million, respectively. These purchases represented
73% and 78%, respectively of all of the Group s purchases for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  

The
Company s largest supplier accounted for approximately $140 million and $613 million, or 57%  and
68% of total purchases for the years ended December 2015 and 2014, respectively.    

The Company commenced trading of heavy oil
in April 2013 , whereby the Company
functions as an agent on behalf of a Hong Kong-based customer. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the trading of
heavy oil consists of purchases of approximately $3 million and $1,769 million, and sales of approximately $3 million, and $1,774
million, resulting in a gain of nil and $4 million, that has been included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations
and comprehensive loss.  

The
Group s operations are carried out in the PRC. Accordingly, the Group s business, financial condition and results
of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC, as well as by the general state
of the PRC s economy. The business may be influenced by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations,
anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.  

As
previously disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed on January 8, 2015, on December 4, 2014, GHP Horwath completed its
engagement that included the audit of the Company s financial statements included in our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2013,
and the reviews of the Company s interim financial statements included in our Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31,
2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014. The Company and GHP Horwath had been discussing its inability to devote significant
resources to the planned remediation of our controls and procedures with regard to financial reporting due to cash constraints
the Company had been experiencing. Although we have been making efforts to remediate the material weaknesses and deficiencies
identified by GHP Horwath (including adopting a related party transaction tracking system, establishing and enhancing accounting
management systems, enforcing controls and monitoring of project budgets, and training accounting staff about U.S. GAAP), the
Company had not yet fully implemented GHP Horwath s recommendations. The Company decided to look for another accounting
firm. On January 2, 2015, GHP Horwath declined to stand for re-appointment due to the Company s failure to  significantly
improve the control environment.  The Company accepted GHP Horwath s letter.  

From
July 5, 2011 when GHP Horwath was engaged, and subsequently through January 2, 2015, there were no disagreements between the Company
and GHP Horwath on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures,
which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of GHP Horwath would have caused them to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports.  

The
audit reports of GHP Horwath on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31,
2012 and 2013 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to audit scope,
or accounting principles. The audit reports of GHP Horwath on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for
the each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern, and the audit report of GHP Horwath on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included explanatory paragraphs related to unusually important events that occurred
in 2011 and significant transactions and relationships with related parties and certain other parties.  

As previously
disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed on November 5, 2015, effective on October 31, 2015, the Company engaged Marcum
Bernstein   Pinchuk LLP ( Marcum BP ) as its new independent registered public accounting firm to provide annual
audit services for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and reviews for quarters during the fiscal years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015. The decision to engage Marcum BP was approved by the Company s audit committee of the Board of Directors.
During its two most recent fiscal years, and during any subsequent interim period prior to the date of Marcum BP s engagement,
the Company did not consult Marcum BP regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a proposed or completed
specified transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided
that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing, or financial reporting
issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or reportable event within the meaning set forth in Regulation
S-K, Item 304 (a)(1)(iv) or (a)(1)(v). On December 4, 2014, GHP Horwath completed its engagement that included the audit of the
Company s financial statements included in our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2013, and the reviews of the Company s interim
financial statements included in our Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014. The
Company and GHP Horwath had been discussing its inability to devote significant resources to the planned remediation of our controls
and procedures with regard to financial reporting due to cash constraints the Company had been experiencing. Although we have
been making efforts to remediate the material weaknesses and deficiencies identified by GHP Horwath (including adopting a related
party transaction tracking system, establishing and enhancing accounting management systems, enforcing controls and monitoring
of project budgets, and training accounting staff about U.S. GAAP), the Company had not yet fully implemented GHP Horwath s
recommendations. The Company decided to look for another accounting firm. On January 2, 2015, GHP Horwath declined to stand for
re-appointment due to the Company s failure to  significantly improve the control environment.  The Company
accepted GHP Horwath s letter.  

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Control and Procedures.    

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not sufficiently effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported properly within the time periods specified by the SEC, and did not provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports would be accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under
the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

Management,
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  

As
a result of the findings of the Audit Committee in connection with the independent investigation described in the Item 1 of this
Report, and its review of our controls and procedures, management concluded that the Company had material weaknesses. A material
weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  

In connection with the preparation of our
financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, management has determined that our internal control
 over the financial reporting was
not effective as of December 31, 2015 to ensure that the Company s financial statements (and related financial statement
disclosures) were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

Some
specific weaknesses in our control environment include:  

1)          Lack of sufficient knowledge of and ability to apply U.S. GAAP principles by our existing key accounting staff;  

2)          Insufficient accounting staff, which results in a failure to segregate duties sufficiently to have an efficient internal control
system and to ensure a timely and proper preparation and review of the financial statements;  

3)          An insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control monitoring activities;  

4)          Lack of internal control consciousness and awareness by individuals responsible for certain key control activities, including
lack of sufficient documentation of our existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls;  

5)          Inadequate training and training programs;  

6)          Inadequate senior management oversight and monitoring of the accounting functions of the organization throughout 2014 and 2015;  

7)          Lack
of policies and procedures to analyze, document, monitor and report on non-routine and complex transactions, construction projects
to identify new related parties, to sufficiently document and monitor certain accounting entries and supporting schedules; and  

8)          Lack
of communication between operations and the accounting/finance departments and inadequate sharing of financial information within
the Company.  

In
the past two fiscal years, we experienced a large amount of turnover in our accounting department and our current staff team is
relatively new and inexperienced, and thus unfamiliar with the Company, as well as U.S. GAAP reporting. In order to meet the rigorous
demands of being a U.S. listed company and remediate the weaknesses that have been identified, we are working on taking or plan
to implement the following additional measures:  

a)          Implementing regular training programs with regard to internal controls, compliance requirements and corporate governance;  

b)          Identifying outside directors with greater U.S. public company experience and increasing board oversight;  

c)          Hiring additional accounting personal, including, but not limited, to an experienced controller;  

d)          Hiring additional senior manager or consultant with the appropriate skills and experience, and background in U.S. GAAP and SEC
reporting;  

e)          Implementing policies and procedures to provide for the rigorous monitoring and oversight of the control environment, monitoring
of the organizational structure, and implementing a robust internal audit program;  

f)          Further evaluating the duties and responsibilities of senior management;  

g)          Implementing procedures in accordance with the related party transaction tracking system for the identification, documentation,
Board approval and appropriate disclosure of potential related party and related party transactions;  

h)          Implementing policies and procedures to ensure that all non-routine transactions are identified in a timely manner, so that all
such transactions are approved by the Board and developing systems and processes to accumulate appropriate documentation supporting
the transactions and to accumulate all information required for disclosure in our financial statements;  

i)          Developing and enhancing policies to ensure that all identified contingencies are evaluated completely and in a timely manner
to provide for a continuous and robust risk assessment process, including evaluation of legal and regulatory considerations related
to business activities;  

j)          Further strengthening policies and procedures related to construction-in-process, including formalized budget monitoring, timely
and accelerated receipt of invoices from vendors to reduce both the risks inherent in the estimation of deductible input VAT and
the risks associated with the estimation of accounts payable, approval of contract change orders and updating of contract schedules
for contract cancellations, and establishing more robust documentation of goods and services received;  

k)          Implementing policies and procedures to ensure that consolidated financial statements are properly reviewed by accounting personnel
and that all supporting schedules are reconciled and reviewed timely; and  

l)          Implementing
policies and procedures to ensure adequate communication and sharing of financial information within the Company.  

If
we are able to successfully undertake the remediation measures outlined above, and if such measures are effectively implemented
and maintained, we believe that we will be able to remediate the material weaknesses discussed above. However, due to the limited
cash flow we are currently experiencing and the lack of experience in public company governance by our key personnel, we are not
able to devote significant resources to the planned remedial measures mentioned above and cannot assure when or if we will be
able to successfully implement these remedial measures.  

This
Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Because we are a smaller reporting company, management s report was not subject to attestation
by our independent registered public accounting firm.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting   

Except as described above, there have been no
changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal years and the quarter ended December
31, 2015, to which this Form 10-K relate that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
controls over financial reporting.

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.  

The following table sets forth certain information
regarding beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of October  13,
2016 by (i) each person (or group of affiliated persons) who is known by us to own more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
shares of our Common Stock, (ii) each director and executive officer and (iii) all of our directors, executive officers and director
nominees as a group. As of October 13, 2016, we had 63,132,726 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.  

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance
with SEC rules and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. For purposes of this table, a person
or group of persons is deemed to have  beneficial ownership  of any shares of Common Stock that such person has the
right to acquire within 60 days of October 13, 2016. For purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares of our Common
Stock held by each person or group of persons named below, any shares that such person or persons has the right to acquire within
60 days of October 13, 2016 is deemed to be outstanding for such person, but is not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of
computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The inclusion herein of any shares listed as beneficially owned does not
constitute an admission of beneficial ownership. 

As of  October
13, 2016, the series A warrants, series B warrants issued in the April-May 2010 Private Placement, and series C warrants and series
D warrants issued in the September 2010 Private Placement were expired. The series A and series M convertible preferred shares
issued in the April-May 2010 Private Placement and the series B convertible preferred shares issued in the September 2010 Private
Placement were converted into shares of Common Stock. Therefore, no derivative securities or share of Common Stock underlying
derivative securities has been taken into account when we calculate the beneficiary ownership.  

We
calculate beneficial ownership for purposes of this table as follows:  

A
+ B   

  X
+ B  

Where:  

  A
= number of shares of Common Stock an person currently owns  

  B
= number of shares of Common Stock an person may own within 60 days  

  X=
number of shares of Common Stock currently outstanding

expenses authorized by the Court. The balance of the Gross Settlement Fund remaining after the above payments shall be the Net
Settlement Fund, which shall be distributed to the Authorized Claimants in accordance with this Stipulation.  

2.
Any sums required to be held in escrow hereunder shall be held by the Escrow Agent for the benefit of the Lead Plaintiffs
and the Settlement Class until the Effective Date. Until the date the Order and Final Judgment is entered, all payments made
from the Settlement Fund, except Notice and Administration Expenses, shall require the signature of an authorized
representative of the Escrow Agent. After the Order and Final Judgment is entered, payments made from the Settlement Fund
shall require the signature of an authorized representative of the Escrow Agent. All funds held by the Escrow Agent shall be
deemed to be in  custodia legis  and shall remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Court until such time as the funds
shall be distributed or returned pursuant to this Stipulation and/or further order of the Court. Other than amounts disbursed
for providing notice to the Settlement Class, customary administration costs, and Taxes and Tax Expenses, and the Attorneys
Fee and Expenses (which shall be paid to Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel within two business days after the Court executes an
order awarding such fees and expenses), the Settlement Fund shall not be distributed until the Effective Date. The Escrow
Agent shall not disburse the Gross Settlement Fund, or any portion thereof, except as provided in this Stipulation, or upon
order of the Court.  

3. The
Escrow Agent may invest any funds in excess of $150,000 in an interest bearing account, and shall collect and reinvest all interest
accrued thereon. Any funds held in escrow in an amount of less than $150,000 may be held in a bank account insured to the extent
possible by the FDIC. Interest earned on the money deposited into the Escrow Account shall be part of the Gross Settlement Fund.  

4.
The Notice and Administration Expenses shall be paid from the Gross Settlement Fund. In order to pay Notice and
Administration Expenses, $100,000 from the Gross Settlement Fund shall be designated as the Notice and Administration Account
upon the entry of the Preliminary Approval Order. Any monies from the Notice and Administration Fund that remain after
administration shall be returned to the Net Settlement Fund. The Notice and appropriate Notice and Administration Account may
be drawn upon by Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel for reasonable and appropriate Notice and Administration Expenses without
further Court approval. The Notice and Administration Account shall be administered solely by the Escrow Agent. Any taxes or
other expenses incurred in connection with the Notice and Administration Account shall be paid from the Notice
and Administration Account or from the remainder of the Gross Settlement Fund. The Released Parties shall not have any
liability or obligation for payment of taxes or other expenses associated with the Notice and Administration Account. Notice
and Administration Expenses in excess of $100,000 shall not be paid out of the Gross Settlement Fund until after the
Effective Date and shall require the approval of the Court. In no event shall an amount more than the Settlement Amount be
paid for Notice and Administration Expenses, and in no event shall the Released Parties be responsible to pay any amount for
Notice and Administration Expenses.  

5. Defendants
shall have access to all records of the Escrow Account, and upon request made to the Escrow Agent, shall receive copies of all
records of disbursements, deposits, and statements of accounts.  

6. After
the Effective Date, the Released Parties shall have no interest in the Gross Settlement Fund or in the Net Settlement Fund. The
Released Parties shall not be liable at any time for the loss of any portion of the Settlement Fund, nor shall they have any liability,
obligation, or responsibility for the investment or maintenance of the Gross Settlement Fund or for the payment of claims, taxes,
legal fees, or any other expenses payable from the Gross Settlement Fund.  

D.
ADMINISTRATION AND CALCULATION OF CLAIMS, FINAL AWARDS, AND DISTRIBUTION OF NET SETTLEMENT FUND   

1. The Claims Administrator
shall administer and calculate the claims that shall be  allowed
and oversee distribution of the Net Settlement Fund to the Settlement Class Members, under the supervision of
Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel, and subject to appeal to, and jurisdiction of, the Court. The Released Parties shall have
no liability, obligation, or responsibility whatsoever for the administration of the Gross Settlement Fund or Net
Settlement Fund, or for the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund.  

2.
Except as otherwise provided below, on and after the Effective Date, the Gross Settlement Fund shall be applied as
follows:  

a. To
the extent not paid from the Notice and Administration Account, to pay following an order of the Court approving any such payment,
the expenses incurred in connection with providing notice to Settlement Class Members, administering and distributing the Net
Settlement Fund to Settlement Class Members, processing Proofs of Claim, processing requests for exclusion, escrow fees and costs,
and any applicable taxes;  

b. Subject
to the approval and further order(s) of the Court, the Net Settlement Fund shall be allocated to Authorized Claimants as set forth
in paragraph F. below.  

c.
After the Claims Administrator calculates the recognized losses of each Authorized Claimant, Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel shall
file a motion for distribution of the Settlement Fund with the Court listing each Authorized Claimant, the amount of each claim
that Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel believes should be allocated and distributed to each such Authorized Claimant, accounting
for all Notice and Administration Expenses, and requesting Court approval to distribute the Settlement Fund to the Authorized
Claimants and pay any further Notice and Administration expenses.  

3. Each
Settlement Class Member wishing to participate in the Settlement shall be required to submit a Proof of Claim and Release (in
substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A-3 hereto, which  inter alia  releases all Settled Claims against all Released
Parties), signed under penalty of perjury by the beneficial owner(s) of the securities that are the subject of the Proof of Claim
and Release, or by someone with documented authority to sign for the beneficial owner(s) and supported by such documents as specified
in the instructions accompanying the Proof of Claim and Release.  

4.
All Proofs of Claim must be postmarked or received within the time prescribed in the Preliminary Approval Order unless otherwise
ordered by the Court. Any Settlement Class Member who fails to submit a properly completed Proof of Claim within such period as
shall be authorized by the Court shall be forever barred from receiving any payments pursuant to this Stipulation or from the
Net Settlement Fund (unless Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel in its discretion deems such late filing to be a formal or technical
defect, or unless by Order of the Court a later submitted Proof of Claim by such Settlement Class Member is approved), but will
in all other respects be subject to the provisions of this Stipulation and the Order and Final Judgment, including, without limitation,
the certification of the Settlement Class, the release of the Settled Claims and dismissal with prejudice of the Litigation. Provided
that it is received before the motion for the Settlement Class Distribution Order is filed, a Proof of Claim shall be deemed to
have been submitted when posted if received with a postmark indicated on the envelope and if mailed by first-class mail and addressed
in accordance with the instructions thereon. In all other cases, the Proof of Claim shall be deemed to have been submitted when
actually received by the Claims Administrator.  

5. Each Proof of Claim shall be
submitted to the Claims Administrator who shall  determine,
under the supervision of Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel, in accordance with this Stipulation and any applicable orders of
the Court, the extent, if any, to which each claim shall be allowed, subject to appeal to the Court. No later than seven (7)
days prior to disbursement of the Net Settlement Fund, Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel shall provide Defendants with a list
of Proofs of Claim received by the Claims Administrator indicating which Proofs of Claim have been allowed by the Claims
Administrator.  

6. Following
notice to Defendants  counsel, Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel shall have the right, but not the obligation, to waive what
they deem to be formal or technical defects in any Proofs of Claim filed, where doing so is in the interest of achieving substantial
justice.  

7. Proofs
of Claim that do not meet the filing requirements may be rejected. Prior to rejection of a Proof of Claim, the Claims Administrator
shall communicate with the Claimant in order to remedy curable deficiencies in the Proof of Claim submitted. The Claims Administrator,
under the supervision of Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel, shall notify in a timely fashion and in writing, all Claimants whose
Proofs of Claim they propose to reject in whole or in part, setting forth the reasons thereof, and shall indicate in such notice
that the Claimant whose claims are to be rejected has the right to review by the Court if the Claimant so desires and complies
with the requirement of paragraph D.8. below.  

8.
If any Claimant whose claim has been rejected in whole or in part desires to contest such rejection, the Claimant must,
within twenty (20) days after the date of mailing of the notice required by paragraph D.7. above, serve upon the Claims
Administrator a notice and statement of reasons indicating the Claimant s ground for contesting the rejection along
with any supporting documentation, and requesting a review thereof by the Court. If a dispute concerning a claim cannot be
otherwise resolved, Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel shall thereafter present the request for review to the Court.  

9. The
administrative determination of the Claims Administrator accepting and rejecting claims shall be presented to the Court, on notice
to Defendants  counsel, for approval by the Court in the Settlement Class Distribution Order.  

10. Each
Claimant shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the Claimant s claim, and the
claim will be subject to investigation and discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that such investigation
and discovery shall be limited to that Claimant s status as a Settlement Class Member and the validity and amount of the
Claimant s claim. No discovery shall be allowed on the merits of the Litigation or Settlement in connection with processing
of the Proofs of Claim.  

11. Payment
pursuant to this Stipulation or order of the Court shall be deemed final and conclusive against all Settlement Class Members.
All Settlement Class Members who fail to submit claims or whose claims are not approved by the Court shall be barred from participating
in distributions from the Net Settlement Fund, but are otherwise bound by all of the terms of the Order and Final Judgment to
be entered in the Litigation and the releases and dismissal provided for herein, and will be barred from bringing any action against
the Released Parties arising out of or relating to the Settled Claims.  

12.
All proceedings with respect to the administration, processing, and determination of claims described by this Stipulation and
the determination of all controversies relating thereto, including disputed questions of law and fact with respect to the validity
of claims, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.  

13.
The Net Settlement Fund shall be distributed to Authorized Claimants by the Claims Administrator upon application to the
Court by Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel for a Settlement Class Distribution Order only after all of the following having
occurred: (i) the Effective Date; (ii) all claims have been processed, and all Claimants whose claims have been rejected or
disallowed, in whole or in part, have been notified and provided the opportunity to be heard concerning such rejection or
disallowance; (iii) all objections with respect to all rejected or disallowed claims have been resolved by the Court, and all
appeals therefrom have been resolved or the time therefor has expired; (iv) all matters with respect to Attorneys  Fees
and Expenses, costs, and disbursements have been resolved by the Court, and all appeals therefrom have been resolved or the
time therefor has expired; and (v) all costs of administration (including, but not limited to, all Taxes and Tax Expenses)
have been paid.  

14.
If any funds remain in the Net Settlement Fund by reason of uncashed checks or otherwise, then, after the Claims Administrator
has made reasonable and diligent efforts to have Settlement Class Members who are entitled to participate in the distribution
of the Net Settlement Fund cash their distribution checks, any balance remaining in the Net Settlement Fund one (1) year after
the initial distribution of such funds shall be re-distributed, after payment of any unpaid costs or fees incurred in administering
the Net Settlement Fund for such redistribution, to Settlement Class Members who have cashed their checks and who would receive
at least $10.00 from such re-distribution. If any funds shall remain in the Net Settlement Fund six months after such re-distribution,
then such balance shall be contributed to a non-sectarian non-profit organization or charity selected by Lead Plaintiffs 
Counsel and approved by the  Court. 

15.
Before the Effective Date, Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel shall file with the Court a declaration under penalty of perjury describing
how notice of the Settlement was given to the Settlement Class and listing the names and addresses of all persons to whom individual
notice of the Settlement was mailed.  

E. TAX
TREATMENT   

1. The
Parties agree to treat the Gross Settlement Fund as being at all times a qualified settlement fund within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation   1.468B-1 and Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, for the taxable years of the Gross Settlement
Fund, beginning with the date it is created. In addition, the Escrow Agent and, as required, the Settling Parties, shall jointly
and timely make such elections as are necessary or advisable to carry out the provisions of this paragraph, including the  relation-back
election  (as defined in Treas. Reg.   1.468B-1(j)(2)) back to the earliest permitted date. Such elections shall be
made in compliance with the procedures and requirements contained in such regulations. It shall be the responsibility of Lead
Plaintiffs  Counsel to timely and properly prepare and deliver the necessary documentation for signature by all necessary
parties, and thereafter to cause the appropriate filing to occur.  

2.
For purposes of Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the
 administrator  shall be Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel. Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel shall timely and properly
file all tax returns necessary or advisable with respect to the Gross Settlement Fund, and make all required tax payments,
including deposits of estimated tax payments in accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.468B-2(k). Such returns (as well as the
election described in paragraph E.1. hereof) shall be consistent with this paragraph and reflect that all taxes (including
any interest or penalties) on the income earned by the Gross Settlement Fund shall be paid out of the Gross Settlement Fund
as provided in paragraph E.3. hereof.  

3.
All (i) taxes (including any interest or penalties) arising with respect to the income earned by the Gross Settlement Fund, including
any taxes or tax detriments that may be imposed upon Defendants with respect to any income earned by the Gross Settlement Fund
for any period during which the Gross Settlement Fund does not qualify as a qualified settlement fund for Federal or state income
tax purposes ( Taxes ); and (ii) expenses and costs incurred in connection with the operation and implementation of
this paragraph (including, without limitation, expenses of tax attorneys and/or accountants, and mailing and distribution costs
and expenses relating to filing (or failing to file) the returns described in this paragraph) ( Tax Expenses ), shall
be paid out of the Gross Settlement Fund. In all events, the Released Parties shall have no liability for Taxes and/or the Tax
Expenses, and Lead Plaintiffs and Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel agree to indemnify and hold the Released Parties harmless for
Taxes and Tax Expenses. Further, Taxes and Tax Expenses shall be treated as, and considered to be, a cost of administration of
the Settlement and shall be timely paid by the Escrow Agent out of the Gross Settlement Fund without prior order from the Court.
The Escrow Agent shall be obligated (notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary) to withhold from distribution to the Settlement
Class Members any funds necessary to pay such Taxes and Tax Expenses, including the establishment of adequate reserves for any
Taxes and Tax Expenses (as well as any amounts that may be required to be withheld under Treas. Reg.   1468B-2(l)(2)). The
Released Parties shall have no responsibility or liability therefor. The Settling Parties hereto agree to cooperate with the Escrow
Agent, each other, and their tax attorneys and accountants to the extent reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this
paragraph.  

F. ALLOCATION
OF NET SETTLEMENT FUND   

1. The
proposed Plan of Allocation is based solely upon Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel s assessment of the merits and the relative
strengths and weaknesses, including recoverable damages, of the claims of the Settlement Class Members.  

2. Defendants
have had no role in formulating the proposed Plan of Allocation and do not and shall not take any position as to the proposed
Plan of Allocation.  

3. The
Released Parties shall have no responsibility for and no obligations or liabilities of any kind whatsoever in connection with
the determination, administration, calculation, or payment of claims to Settlement Class Members.  

4. Defendants
shall have no involvement in the solicitation of, or review of Proofs of Claim, or involvement in the administration process itself,
which shall be conducted by the Claims Administrator in accordance with this Stipulation, the Order and Final Judgment, and any
other applicable order to be entered by the Court. No Claimant or Authorized Claimant shall have any claim against the Released
Parties or their counsel based on, or in any way relating to, the determination, administration, calculation, or payment of claims
to Settlement Class Members and/or any distributions from either the Gross Settlement Fund or the Net Settlement Fund.  

5. No
Authorized Claimant shall have any claim against Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel or the Claims Administrator based on, or in any
way relating to, the distributions from the Net Settlement Fund that have been made substantially in accordance with this Stipulation
and any applicable orders of the Court.  

6.
The proposed Plan of Allocation is not a necessary term of this Stipulation and it is not a condition of the Stipulation
that the proposed Plan of Allocation be approved by the Court. Any change in the allocation of the Net Settlement Fund
ordered by the Court shall not affect the validity or finality of this Settlement.  

G.
OBLIGATIONS OF AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY OF ESCROW AGENT   

1.
The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the payment of any sums due to Authorized Claimants or other Persons, except to
the extent of maintaining account of and properly paying sums as required by this Stipulation to the limited extent that such
sums have been delivered into the Escrow Account or Notice and Administration Account as required by this Stipulation. The
Escrow Agent shall be liable only for acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct.  

H.
LEAD PLAINTIFFS  COUNSEL S REQUEST FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS  FEES AND EXPENSES   

1. Lead
Plaintiffs  Counsel intends to submit an application to the Court, on notice to counsel for Defendants, for the payment
of Attorneys  Fees and Expenses, including: (i) an award of attorneys  fees up to one-third of the Settlement Amount;
(ii) reimbursement of litigation costs and expenses, plus interest, including fees and expenses of experts, incurred in connection
with the prosecution of the Litigation; and (iii) an Award to Lead Plaintiffs (for reimbursement of time and expenses).  

2.
Any Attorneys  Fees and Expenses and Award to Lead Plaintiffs awarded by the Court shall be paid from the Gross Settlement
Fund within two business days after the Court enters an order awarding such fees and expenses. Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel
may thereafter allocate the attorneys  fees among other Plaintiffs  counsel in a manner in which Lead Plaintiffs 
Counsel in good faith believe reflects the contributions of such counsel to the initiation, prosecution, and resolution of the
Litigation. If, and when, as a result of any appeal and/or further proceedings on remand, or successful collateral attack, the
Attorneys  Fees and Expenses award is overturned or lowered, or if the settlement is terminated or is not approved by the
Court, or if there is an appeal and any order approving the settlement does not become final and binding upon the Settlement Class,
then, within five (5) business days from receiving notice from Keyuan s counsel or from a court of appropriate jurisdiction,
Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel shall refund to the Settlement Fund such fees and expenses previously paid to them from the Settlement
Fund plus interest thereon at the same rate as earned on the Settlement Fund in an amount consistent with such reversal or modification.
Each such Plaintiffs  counsel s law firm receiving fees and expenses, as a condition of receiving such fees and expenses,
on behalf of itself and each partner and/or shareholder of it, agrees that the law firm and its partners and/or shareholders are
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this paragraph.  

3. Lead
Plaintiffs  Counsel waives the right to make an additional application or applications for payment from the Gross Settlement
Fund for fees and expenses incurred after the Settlement Hearing, provided that the original application was approved by the Court.
The other Settling Parties shall take no position on any application concerning Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel s request
or award of attorneys  fees and reimbursement of expenses, or Award to Lead Plaintiffs.  

4.
It is agreed that the procedure for and the allowance or disallowance by the Court of any applications by Lead
Plaintiffs  Counsel for Attorneys  Fees and Expenses, including fees for experts and consultants to be paid out
of the Gross Settlement Fund, are not part of the Settlement set forth in the Stipulation, and are to be considered by the
Court separately from the Court s consideration of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement, and any
order or proceeding relating thereto, or reversal or modification thereof, shall not operate to terminate or cancel this
Stipulation or affect its finality, and shall have no effect on the terms of this Stipulation or on the enforceability of
this Settlement.  

5.
The Released Parties and their counsel have no responsibility for, and no liability whatsoever with respect to, any payment to
Plaintiffs  counsel from the Settlement Fund. The Released Parties and their counsel shall have no responsibility for, and
no liability whatsoever with respect to the allocation among Plaintiffs  counsel, and/or any other Person who may assert
some claim to, any Attorneys  Fees and Expenses award that the Court may make in the Litigation.

                                         ORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING SETTLEMENT AND PROVIDING FOR NOTICE     

WHEREAS,
(i) Lead Plaintiffs Neil Vanleeuwen and Rodney Omanoff ( Lead Plaintiffs ), on behalf of themselves and the putative

2. The
Court preliminarily approves the Settlement of the Litigation as set forth in the Stipulation, subject to the right of any Settlement

final judgment dismissing the Litigation based on the Stipulation should not be entered, and subject to further consideration
of such matters by the Court at the hearing on final approval of the Stipulation described below.  

3.

b.  
      to
    finally determine whether the Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and should be approved by the Court;   

c.  
      to
    finally determine whether the Order and Final Judgment as provided under the Stipulation should be entered, dismissing the

Parties as set forth in the Stipulation, should be ordered, along with a permanent injunction barring efforts to bring any
claims extinguished by the release;   

d.  
      to
    finally determine whether the proposed Plan of Allocation for the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund is fair and reasonable

6.
The Court reserves the right to approve the Settlement with such modifications as may be agreed upon or consented to by the Settling

    the Claims Administrator has considered a timely-submitted Proof of Claim, it shall determine whether such claim is valid,
    deficient or rejected. For each claim determined to be either deficient or rejected, the Claims Administrator shall send a
    deficiency letter or rejection letter as appropriate, describing the basis on which the claim was so determined. Persons who
    timely submit a Proof of Claim that is deficient or otherwise rejected shall be afforded a reasonable time (at least seven
    (7) calendar days) to cure such deficiency if it shall appear that such deficiency may be cured.

Release and/or the permanent injunction set forth in the Stipulation be enforced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by entering into
the Stipulation and Settlement, the Settling Parties shall not be deemed to be have submitted generally to the jurisdiction of
the Court or to the State of New York or for any purpose other than as set forth in this paragraph.

      CASE
    No.: 1:13-cv-06057 (PAC)   

NOTICE
OF PENDENCY AND    
   SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION     

If
you purchased (a) common stock ( Stock ) of Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc. ( Keyuan  or the  Company )
during the period from August 16, 2010 through October 7, 2011, inclusive (the  Class Period ) and/or (b) Keyuan securities
pursuant to the confidential private offering memorandum dated March 22, 2010, consisting of purchasers in the first tranche that
closed on April 22, 2010 and the second tranche that closed on May 18, 2010, you could get a payment from a proposed class action
settlement (the  Settlement ).  

Under
law, a federal court has authorized this notice.   

If approved by the
    Court, the proposed settlement would establish a fund in the aggregate amount of $2,650,000 in cash, plus interest (the  Settlement
    Amount ).   

The Settlement represents
    an estimated average recovery of $0.30 per share of Keyuan Stock for the approximately 8.8 million shares outstanding and
    available for trade during the Class Period. A share may have been traded more than once during the Class Period. This estimate
    solely reflects the average recovery per outstanding share of Keyuan Stock. The indicated average recovery per share will
    be the total average recovery for all purchasers of that share. This is not an estimate of the actual recovery per share you
    should expect. Your actual recovery will depend on the aggregate losses of all Settlement Class Members, the date(s) you purchased
    and sold Keyuan Stock and/or securities, and the total number of claims filed.   

Attorneys
    for Lead Plaintiffs ( Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel  ) intend to ask the Court to award them fees of up to $883,333.33
    or thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the Settlement Amount, reimbursement of litigation expenses of no more
    than $70,000 and an award to the Lead Plaintiffs collectively not to exceed $20,000. Collectively, the attorneys  fees
    and expenses and award to Lead Plaintiffs are estimated to average $0.11 per share of Keyuan Stock. If approved by the Court,
    these amounts will be paid from the Gross Settlement Fund.   

The
    approximate recovery, after deduction of attorneys  fees and expenses approved by the Court, is an average of $0.19
    per share of Keyuan Stock. This estimate is based on the assumptions set forth in the preceding paragraph. Your actual recovery,
    if any, will vary depending on your purchase price and sales price, and the number of claims filed.   

The
    Settlement resolves the lawsuit concerning claims of whether or not Keyuan and its officers and directors made false and misleading
    statements, in violation of federal securities laws, based upon the allegations set forth in the Third Amended Complaint,
    including that Keyuan (1) misled investors by failing to disclose certain related-party transactions and (2) filed false and/or
    misleading financial statements.   

Your
    legal rights will be affected whether you act or do not act. If you do not act, you may permanently forfeit your right to
    recover on this claim. Therefore, you should read this notice carefully.

COMMON
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING THE SETTLEMENT   

1.   
       Why did I get this Notice?    

You
or someone in your family may have acquired Keyuan Stock and/or securities during the Class Period.  

2.   
       What is this lawsuit about?    

The
case is known as  Vanleeuwen, et al., v. Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc., et al.,  Case No. 1:13-cv-06057 (PAC) (the  Litigation ),
and the Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  

The
Litigation involves claims of whether or not any of the Defendants violated the federal securities laws because the Company allegedly
made false and misleading statements to the investing public as set out in the Third Amended Complaint, including that (1) Keyuan
engaged in unreported related-party transactions and (2) Keyuan s financial statements were false and/or misleading. The
Settling Defendants deny they did anything wrong. The proposed Settlement resolves all of the claims in the Litigation against
the Settling Defendants.  

3.   
       Why is this a class action?    

In
a class action, one or more persons and/or entities, called Lead Plaintiffs, sue on behalf of all persons and/or entities who
have similar claims. All of these persons and/or entities are referred to collectively as a Class, and these individual persons
and/or entities are known as  Class Members.  One court resolves all of the issues for all Class Members, except for
those Class Members who exclude themselves from the Class.  

4.   
       Why is there a Settlement?    

Lead
Plaintiffs and Settling Defendants do not agree regarding the merits of Lead Plaintiffs  allegations with respect to
liability or the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if Lead Plaintiffs were to prevail at trial on
each claim. The issues on which the Lead Plaintiffs and Settling Defendants disagree include: (1) whether Settling Defendants
made materially false and misleading statements; (2) whether Settling Defendants made these statements with the intent to
defraud the investing public; (3) whether the statements were the cause of the Settlement Class Members  alleged
damages; and (4) the amount of damages, if any, suffered by the Settlement Class Members.  

This
matter has not gone to trial and the Court has not decided in favor of either Lead Plaintiffs or Settling Defendants. Instead,
Lead Plaintiffs and Settling Defendants have agreed to settle the Litigation. Lead Plaintiffs and Class Counsel believe the Settlement
is best for all Class Members because of the risks associated with continued litigation and the nature of the defenses raised
by Settling Defendants. Even if Plaintiffs were to win at trial, and also withstand Settling Defendants  inevitable challenge
on appeal, Plaintiffs might not be able to collect some, or all, of the judgment.  

5.   
       How do I know if I am part of the Class settlement?    

To
be a Settlement Class Member, you must have purchased (a) Keyuan Stock during the period from August 16, 2010 through and including
October 7, 2011, inclusive and/or (b) Keyuan securities pursuant to the confidential private offering memorandum dated March 22,
2010 consisting of purchasers in the first tranche that closed on April 22, 2010 and the second tranche that closed on May 18,
2010.  

6.   
       Are there exceptions to being included?    

Yes.
Excluded from the Settlement Class are Defendants, TriPoint Global Equities, LLC ( TriPoint ), the present and former
officers and directors of Keyuan or TriPoint and any subsidiary thereof, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives,
heirs, successors or assigns and any entity in which any Defendant or excluded person has or had a controlling interest. Additionally,
if you exclude yourself from the Class, as described below, you are not a part of the Class.  

7.   
       What does the Settlement provide?    

a.   
       What is the Settlement Fund?    

The
proposed Settlement calls for Settling Defendants to create a Gross Settlement Fund in the amount of $2,650,000. The Settlement
is subject to Court approval. Also, subject to the Court s approval, a portion of the Gross Settlement Fund will be used
to pay Lead Plaintiffs  attorneys  fees and reasonable litigation expenses and any award to Lead Plaintiffs. A portion
of the Settlement Fund also will be used to pay taxes due on interest earned by the Gross Settlement Fund, if necessary, and any
notice and claims administration expenses permitted by the Court. After the foregoing deductions from the Settlement Fund have
been made, the amount remaining (the  Net Settlement Fund ) will be distributed to Settlement Class Members who submit
valid claims.  

b.   
       What can you expect to receive under the proposed
Settlement?    

Your
share of the Net Settlement Fund will or may depend on: (i) the number of claims filed; (ii) the dates you purchased and sold
Keyuan Stock and/or securities; (iii) the prices of your purchases and sales; (iv) the amount of administrative costs, including
the costs of notice; and (v) the amount awarded by the Court to Lead Plaintiffs and their counsel for attorneys  fees, costs,
and expenses.  

The
Claims Administrator will determine each Settlement Class Member s  pro rata  share of the Net Settlement Fund based
upon each Settlement Class Member s valid  Recognized Claim.  The Recognized Claim formula is not intended to
be an estimate of the amount that a Settlement Class Member might have been able to recover after a trial; it also is not an estimate
of the amount that will be paid to Settlement Class Members pursuant to the Settlement. The Recognized Claim formula is the basis
upon which the Net Settlement Fund will be proportionately allocated to the Settlement Class Members with valid claims.  

The
Net Settlement Fund will be distributed to Class Members who submit valid, timely claim forms ( Authorized
Claimants ) under the below Plan of Allocation, which reflects Lead Plaintiffs  contention that because of the
alleged misrepresentations and omissions made by Defendants, the price of Keyuan Stock and securities was artificially
inflated during the Class Period and that disclosures and materialization of the true facts caused changes in the inflated
stock price.  

The
Recognized Claim, or compensable loss per share, of each Authorized Claimant shall be calculated according to the following formula:  

PROPOSED
PLAN OF ALLOCATION OF THE NET SETTLEMENT FUND     

The
Plan of Allocation is a matter separate and apart from the proposed Settlement, and any decision by the Court concerning the Plan
of Allocation shall not affect the validity or finality of the proposed Settlement. The Court may approve the Plan of Allocation
with or without modifications agreed to among the parties, or another plan of allocation, without further notice to Settlement
Class Members. Any orders regarding a modification of the Plan of Allocation will be posted to the Claims Administrator s
website, www.strategicclaims.net.  

The
Claims Administrator shall determine each Authorized Claimant s  pro rata  share of the Net Settlement Fund based upon
each Authorized Claimant s Recognized Claim.   Please Note   :  The Recognized Claim formula, set forth below,
is not intended to be an estimate of the amount of what a Settlement Class Member might have been able to recover after a trial,
nor is it an estimate of the amount that will be paid to Authorized Claimants pursuant to the Settlement. The Recognized Claim
formula is the basis upon which the Net Settlement Fund will be proportionately allocated to the Authorized Claimants. To the
extent there are sufficient funds remaining in the Net Settlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive an amount equal
to the Authorized Claimant s Recognized Claim. If, however, the Net Settlement Fund is not sufficient to permit payment
of the total Recognized Claim of each Authorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shall be paid the percentage of the Net
Settlement Fund that each Authorized Claimant s Recognized Claim bears to the total Recognized Claims of all Authorized
Claimants ( i.e. ,   pro rata  share ). Payment in this manner shall be deemed conclusive against all Authorized
Claimants. No distribution will be made on a claim where the potential distribution amount is less than ten dollars ($10.00) in
cash.  

If
any of the Net Settlement Fund remains by reason of uncashed checks, or otherwise, after the Claims Administrator has made reasonable
and diligent efforts to have Authorized Claimants who are entitled to participate in the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund
cash their distribution checks, then any balance remaining in the Net Settlement Fund six (6) months after the initial distribution
of such funds shall be used: (i) first, to pay any amounts mistakenly omitted from the initial distribution to Authorized Claimants
or to pay any late, but otherwise valid and fully documented claims received after the cut-off date used to make the initial distribution,
provided that such distributions to any late post-distribution claimants meet all of the other criteria for inclusion in the initial
distribution, including the $10.00 minimum check amount set forth in the Notice; (ii) second, to pay any additional Notice and
Administration Expenses incurred in administering the Settlement; and (iii) finally, to make a second distribution to Authorized
Claimants who cashed their checks from the initial distribution and who would receive at least $10.00 from such second distribution,
after payment of the estimated costs or fees to be incurred in administering the Net Settlement Fund and in making this second
distribution, if such second distribution is economically feasible. If six (6) months after such second distribution, if undertaken,
or if such second distribution is not undertaken, any funds shall remain in the Net Settlement Fund after the Settlement Administrator
has made reasonable and diligent efforts to have Authorized Claimants who are entitled to participate in this Settlement cash
their checks, any funds remaining in the Net Settlement Fund shall be donated to a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization(s) selected
by Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel.  

THE
BASIS FOR CALCULATING YOUR RECOGNIZED CLAIM:    

Each
Authorized Claimant shall be allocated a  pro rata  share of the Net Settlement Fund based on his, her or its Recognized
Claim as compared to the total Recognized Claims of all Authorized Claimants.  

A.  
      For
    shares retained at the end of trading on October 6, 2011 the Recognized Claim shall be the lesser of $3.26 per share; or the
    difference between the purchase price per share and $1.79 per share. 1    

1
 Pursuant to Section 21(D)(e)(1) of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,  in any private action arising
under this title in which the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, the award of
damages to the plaintiff shall not exceed the difference between the purchase or sale price paid or received, as appropriate,
by the plaintiff for the subject security and the mean trading price of that security during the 90-day period beginning on the
date on which the information correcting the misstatement or omission that is the basis for the action is disseminated. 
$1.79 per share was the mean (average) daily closing trading price of Chanticleer s common stock during the 90-day period
beginning on October 7, 2011 and ending on January 4, 2012.  

B.  
      If
    sold on or before October 6, 2011, the Recognized Claim will be zero.   

II)  
      Keyuan Units purchased or otherwise acquired in the
private offering memorandum dated March 22, 2010 consisting of purchasers in the first tranche that closed on April 22, 2010 and
the second tranche that closed on May 18, 2010. Each Unit effectively represents 10 shares of common stock at a purchase price
of $3.50 2  per share:   

A.  
      For
    common shares retained at the end of trading on October 6, 2011 the Recognized Claim shall be $1.71 3  per share   

B.  
      If
    sold on or before October 6, 2011, the Recognized Claim will be zero.   

For
purposes of calculating your Recognized Claim, the date of purchase, acquisition or sale is the  contract  or  trade 
 date  and not the  settlement  or  payment  date. The receipt or grant
by gift, inheritance or operation of law of Keyuan Units and common shares shall not be deemed a purchase, acquisition or sale
of Keyuan Units and common shares for the calculation of an Authorized Claimant s Recognized Claim.  

For
purposes of calculating your Recognized Claim, all purchases, acquisitions and sales shall be matched on a First In First Out
( FIFO ) basis in chronological order. Therefore, on the Proof of Claim enclosed with this Notice, you must provide
all of your purchases and acquisitions of Keyuan Units and common shares during the time period from August 16, 2010 through and
including October 6, 2011.  

Payment
pursuant to the Plan of Allocation approved by the Court shall be conclusive against all Authorized Claimants. No person shall
have any claim against Defendants, Settling  

2
 The purchase price of each Unit was $35. Each Unit effectively represents 10 shares of common stock. Therefore, the effective
purchase price per common share is $3.50.  

   3
 This represents the difference between the effective purchase price of $3.50 per share and the 90 day  look back 
price of $1.79 per share.  

Defendants 
Counsel, Lead Plaintiffs, Lead Plaintiffs  Counsel or the Claims Administrator or other agent designated by Lead Plaintiffs 
Counsel based on the distributions made substantially in accordance with the Stipulation and the Settlement contained therein,
the Plan of Allocation, or further orders of the Court. Each Claimant shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of
the Court with respect to the Claimant s Claim Form. All persons involved in the review, verification, calculation, tabulation,
or any other aspect of the processing of the claims submitted in connection with the Settlement, or otherwise involved in the
administration or taxation of the Settlement Fund or the Net Settlement Fund shall be released and discharged from any and all
claims arising out of such involvement, and all Settlement Class Members, whether or not they are to receive payment from the
Net Settlement Amount, will be barred from making any further claim against the Net Settlement Fund beyond the amount allocated
to them as provided in any distribution orders entered by the Court.  

c.   
       Are there any further limitations on the amount I
may receive?    

i)  
      To
    the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net Settlement Fund, an Authorized Claimant will receive an amount equal to the
    Authorized Claimant s Recognized Claim described above. If, however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is not sufficient
    to permit payment of the total Recognized Claim of each Authorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shall be paid the
    percentage of the Net Settlement Fund that each Authorized Claimant s Recognized Claim bears to the total of the Recognized
    Claims of all Authorized Claimants.   

ii)  
      For
    Settlement Class Members who conducted multiple transactions in Keyuan Stock and/or securities during the Class Period, the
    earliest subsequent sale shall be matched first against those shares in the Claimant s opening position on the first
    day of the Class Period, and then matched chronologically thereafter against each purchase made during the Class Period.   

iii)  
      Transactions during the Class Period resulting in a
gain shall be netted against the Settling Class Members  transactions resulting in a loss to arrive at the Recognized Claim.   

iv)  
      Any Settlement Class Members whose collective transactions
in Keyuan Stock and/or securities during the Class Period resulted in a net gain shall not be entitled to share in the Net Settlement
Fund.   

v)  
      The purchase and sales prices exclude any brokerage
commissions, transfer taxes or other fees.   

vi)  
      The covering purchase of a short sale is not an eligible
purchase. Gifts and transfers are not eligible purchases.   

8.   
       How can I get a payment?    

To
qualify for a payment, you must send in a form entitled  Proof of Claim and Release  form. This claim form is attached
to this Notice. You may also obtain a claim form on the Internet at  www.strategicclaims.net . Read the instructions carefully,

The
Claims Administrator will process your claim and determine whether you are an Authorized Claimant.  

9.   
       What am I giving up to get a payment or stay in the
Settlement Class?    

Unless
you exclude yourself, you will remain in the Settlement Class. That means that if the Settlement is approved, you and all
Settling Class Members will release (agreeing never to sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit) all claims
against Defendants and  Released Parties:  Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc., Chunfeng Tao, Aichun Li, Weifeng Xue and
Delight Reward Limited, as well as their current, former, and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, joint
venturers, officers, directors, principals, shareholders, members, agents (acting in their capacity as agents), employees,
attorneys, consultants, experts, accountants, auditors, spouses, immediate family members, estates, trusts, trustees,
insurers (including, but not limited to, Navigators Insurance Company and its attorneys), reinsurers, advisors, associates,
and all other individuals and entities in which a Defendant has or had a controlling interest or which are or were related to
or affiliated with any Defendant, and all of their current, former, and future legal representatives, executors,
administrators, trustees, beneficiaries, heirs, successors-in-interest, and/or assigns, EXCEPT THAT Patrizio   Zhao LLC,
P K CPAs LLC, Xinggeng (John) Zhao, and John G. Patrizio (the named defendants in the Auditor Case) are not Released
Parties.  

If
you sign the claim form, you are agreeing to a  Release of Claims,  which will bar you from ever filing a lawsuit
against the Released Parties with respect to the Settled Claims (as defined in the Stipulation) and/or to recover losses from
the acquisition or sale of Keyuan Stock and securities during the Class Period, except to enforce the Settlement. That means you
will accept a share in the Net Settlement Fund as sole compensation for any losses you have suffered in the acquisition and sale
of Keyuan Stock and securities during the Class Period.  

Further
detail and information about what you are agreeing to and giving up is detailed in the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement
which is available at  www.strategicclaims.net .  

10.   
       How do I get out of the Settlement?    

If
you do not want to receive a payment from this Settlement, and you want to keep any right you may have to sue or continue to sue
any of the Defendants individually on your own, based on the legal claims raised in this Litigation, then you must take steps
to get out of the Settlement. This is called excluding yourself from   or  opting out  of   the Settlement.
To exclude yourself from the Settlement, you must mail a letter stating you want to be excluded as a Settlement Class Member from
 Vanleeuwen, et al., v. Keyuan Petrochemicals,
Inc., et al.,  Case No. 1:13-cv-06057 (PAC). Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number and your signature, along
with an accurate list of all of your purchases and sales of Keyuan Stock and/or securities and supporting account documentation.
You must mail your exclusion request, postmarked no later than _____ __, 2015, to:

You
cannot exclude yourself by telephone or by e-mail. If you ask to be excluded, you will not receive a settlement payment, and you
cannot object to the Settlement. If you ask to be excluded, you will not be legally bound by anything that happens in this Litigation.  

11.   
       If I do not exclude myself, can I sue Defendants
for the same thing later?    

No.
Unless you exclude yourself, you give up any right to sue Defendants or any Released Party for the claims that this Settlement
resolves. If you have a pending lawsuit, speak to your lawyer in that case immediately, since you may have to exclude yourself
from this Settlement Class to continue your own lawsuit.  

12.   
       Do I have a lawyer in this case?    

The
Court has appointed The Rosen Law Firm, P.A. as class counsel to represent the Settlement Class Members for the purposes of this
settlement ( Settlement Class Counsel ). You have the option to retain your own separate counsel at your own cost
and expense. You need not retain your own separate counsel to opt-out, object, submit a Proof of Claim, or appear at the Settlement
Hearing.  

13.   
       How will the lawyers be paid?    

Settlement
Class Counsel has expended considerable time litigating this action on a contingent fee basis, and has paid for the expenses of
the litigation itself and has not been paid attorneys  fees in advance of this Settlement. Settlement Class Counsel has
done so with the expectation that if it is successful in recovering money for the Settlement Class, it will receive attorneys 
fees and be reimbursed for its litigation expenses from the Gross Settlement Fund, as is customary in this type of litigation.
Settlement Class Counsel will not receive attorneys  fees or be reimbursed for its litigation expenses except from the Gross
Settlement Fund. Therefore, Settlement Class Counsel will file a motion asking the Court at the Settlement Hearing to make an
award of attorneys  fees in an amount not to exceed $883,333.33 for reimbursement of reasonable litigation expenses not
to exceed $70,000 and an award to Lead Plaintiffs in an amount not to exceed $20,000. The Court may award less than these amounts.
Any amounts awarded by the Court will come out of the Settlement Fund.  

14.   
       How do I tell the Court that I do not like the Settlement?    

You
can tell the Court you do not agree with the Settlement, any part of the Settlement, or Settlement Class Counsel s motion
for attorneys  fees, and that you think the Court should not approve the Settlement, by mailing a letter stating that you
object to the Settlement in the matter of  Vanleeuwen, et al., v. Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc., et al.,  Case No. 1:13-cv-06057(PAC).
Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, your signature, a list of your purchases and sales of Keyuan Stock and/or
securities in order to show your membership in the Settlement Class, and all of the reasons you object to the Settlement. Be sure
to mail the objections to the five different places listed below, postmarked no later than ______________ __, 2015, so the Court
will consider your views:

15.   
       What is the difference between objecting and requesting
exclusion?    

Objecting
is simply telling the Court you do not like something about the Settlement. You can object only if you stay in the
Settlement Class. Requesting exclusion is telling the Court you do not want to be part of the Settlement Class and the
Settlement. If you exclude yourself, you cannot object to the Settlement because it no longer concerns you. If you stay in
the Settlement Class and object, but your objection is overruled, you will not be allowed a second opportunity to exclude
yourself.  

16.   
       When and where will the Court decide whether to approve
the Settlement?    

The
Court will hold a Settlement Hearing on _____ __, 2015, at __:__ _.m., at the United States District Court, Southern District
of New York, 500 Pearl Street, Courtroom 14C, New York, New York, 10007-1312.  

At
this hearing, the Court will consider whether the Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate and whether to approve the Settlement.
If there are objections, the Court will consider them, and the Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing.
The Court may also decide how much to pay Settlement Class Counsel for attorneys  fees and expenses.  

17.   
       Do I have to come to the hearing?    

No.
Settlement Class Counsel will answer any questions the Court may have. However, you are welcome to attend at your own expense.
If you send an objection, you do not have to come to Court to talk about it. As long as you mail your written objection on time,
the Court will consider it.  

18.   
       What happens if I do nothing at all?    

If
you do nothing, you will not receive a payment from the Settlement. However, unless you exclude yourself, you will not be able
to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against Defendants or Released Parties about the
claims made in this case ever again.

1.  
      I
    (we) purchased Keyuan common stock and/or securities and was (were) damaged thereby. (Do not submit this Proof of Claim if
    you did not purchase Keyuan common stock or securities during the designated Class Period).   

KEYUAN
PETROCHEMICALS, INC.  

2.  
      By
    submitting this Proof of Claim, I (we) state that I (we) believe in good faith that I am (we are) a Class Member as defined
    above and in the Notice of Pendency and Settlement
of Class Action (the  Notice ), or am (are) acting for such person(s); that I am (we are) not a Defendant in the Litigation
or anyone excluded from the Settlement Class; that I (we) have read and understand the Notice; that I (we) believe that I am (we
are) entitled to receive a share of the Net Settlement Fund, as defined in the Notice; that I (we) elect to participate in the
proposed Settlement described in the Notice; and that I (we) have not filed a request for exclusion. (If you are acting in a representative
capacity on behalf of a Class Member [e.g., as an executor, administrator, trustee, or other representative], you must submit
evidence of your current authority to act on behalf of that Class Member. Such evidence would include, for example, letters testamentary,
letters of administration, or a copy of the trust documents.)   

3.  
      I
    (we) consent to the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to all questions concerning the validity of this Proof of Claim.
    I (we) understand and agree that my (our) claim may be subject to investigation and discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure, provided that such investigation and discovery shall be limited to my (our) status as a Class Member(s) and the
    validity and amount of my (our) claim. No discovery shall be allowed on the merits of the Litigation or Settlement in connection
    with processing of the Proof of Claim.

5.

    (we) have enclosed photocopies of the stockbroker s confirmation slips, stockbroker s statements, or other documents
    evidencing each purchase, sale or retention of Keyuan common stock and/or securities listed below in support of my (our) claim.
    (IF ANY SUCH DOCUMENTS ARE NOT IN YOUR POSSESSION, PLEASE OBTAIN A COPY OR EQUIVALENT DOCUMENTS FROM YOUR BROKER BECAUSE THESE

6.  
      I
    (we) understand that the information contained in this Proof of Claim is subject to such verification as the Claims Administrator
    may request or as the Court may direct, and I (we) agree to cooperate in any such verification. (The information requested
    herein is designed to provide the minimum amount of information necessary to process most simple claims. The Claims Administrator
    may request additional information as required to efficiently and reliably calculate your recognized claim. In some cases,

    where applicable, information concerning transactions in any derivatives securities such as options.)

[PROPOSED]
        ORDER AND FINAL JUDGMENT     

On
the ____ day of ______________, 2015, a hearing having been held before this Court to determine: (1) whether the terms and
conditions of the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement dated April 27, 2015 (the  Stipulation ) are fair,
reasonable and adequate for the settlement of all claims asserted by (i) Plaintiffs against (ii) Keyuan Petrochemicals Inc.,
( Keyuan ), Chunfeng Tao, and Aichun Li (collectively  Settling Defendants ) and (2) whether to
approve the proposed Plan of Allocation as a fair and reasonable method to allocate the Net Settlement Fund among Settlement
Class Members; and  

The
Court having considered all matters submitted to it at the hearing and otherwise; and  

It appearing that the Notice
substantially in the form approved by the Court in the Court s Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement and Providing
For Notice ( Preliminary Approval Order ) was mailed to all reasonably identifiable Settlement Class Members and
otherwise made available on Strategic Claims Services  website; and  

It
appearing that the Summary Notice substantially in the form approved by the Court in the Preliminary Approval Order was published
in accordance with that Order and the specifications of the Court;  

NOW,
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:  

1. All
capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings as set forth and defined in the Stipulation.  

2. The
Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the Litigation, Lead Plaintiffs, all Settlement Class Members and the Settling
Defendants.  

3. For
purposes of this Settlement, this is a class action on behalf of all persons who purchased (a) Keyuan common stock from August
16, 2010 through October 7, 2011, inclusive, and/or (b) Keyuan securities pursuant to the confidential private offering memorandum
dated March 22, 2010 consisting of purchasers in the first tranche that closed on April 22, 2010 and the second tranche that closed
on May 18, 2010, and who were allegedly damaged thereby (the  Settlement Class ). Excluded from the Settlement Class
are Defendants, TriPoint Global Equities, LLC ( TriPoint ), the present and former officers and directors of Keyuan
or TriPoint and any subsidiary thereof, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors
or assigns and any entity in which any Defendant or excluded person has or had a controlling interest. Also excluded from the
Settlement Class are those persons who filed valid and timely requests for exclusion in accordance with the Preliminary Approval
Order.  

4. The
Court hereby finds that the forms and methods of notifying the Settlement Class of the Settlement and its terms and conditions
met the requirements of due process and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Section 21D(a)(7) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C.   78u-4(a)(7), as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; constituted the best notice
practicable under the circumstances; and constituted due and sufficient notice to all persons and entities entitled thereto of
these proceedings and the matters set forth herein, including the Settlement and Plan of Allocation, to all persons entitled to
such notice. No Settlement Class Member is relieved from the terms of the Settlement, including the releases provided for therein,
based upon the contention or proof that such Settlement Class Member failed to receive actual or adequate notice. A full opportunity
has been offered to the Settlement Class Members to object to the proposed Settlement and to participate in the hearing thereon.
The Court further finds that the notice provisions of the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C.   1715, were fully discharged.
Thus, it is hereby determined that all members of the Settlement Class are bound by this Order and Final Judgment except those
persons listed on Exhibit A to this Order and Final Judgment.  

5. The
Settlement is approved as fair, reasonable and adequate, and in the best interests of the Plaintiffs. Lead Plaintiffs and Settling
Defendants are directed to consummate the Settlement in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stipulation.  

6. The
Litigation and the operative Third Amended Complaint are hereby dismissed in their entirety, with prejudice, and without costs.

Person that any of them represents, shall and by operation of this Order and Final Judgment are hereby deemed to have fully,
finally, and forever released, relinquished and discharged, and are forever enjoined from prosecuting, any and all of the
Settled Claims and all claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Settlement, the Litigation, and/or the
resolution of the Litigation against the Released Parties, whether or not such Settlement Class Member executes and delivers
the Proof of Claim and Release form or shares in the Settlement Fund.  

8. Upon
the Effective Date, Defendants shall release and forever discharge each and every one of the Settled Defendants  Claims,
and by operation of this Order and Final Judgment shall be forever enjoined from prosecuting Defendants  Claims as against
any of the Lead Plaintiffs, Settlement Class Members, or their attorneys, including but not limited to claims for malicious prosecution
or sanctions.  

9. Any
order on any Plan of Allocation submitted by Lead Plaintiffs shall in no way disturb or affect this Judgment and shall be considered
separate from this Order and Final Judgment.  

10. In
accordance with 15 U.S.C.   78u-4(f)(7) and all other applicable laws and regulations, any and all claims by any Person against
any of the Settling Defendants and/or other Released Persons for contribution or indemnification arising out of or relating in
any way to any Settled Claim, or where the alleged damage to the claimant is measured by reference to the claimant s liability
to any of the Lead Plaintiffs and/or Settlement Class Members, are hereby permanently barred and discharged. Further:  

(a)  
      All
    claims for contribution and indemnification, however denominated, based upon or arising under the federal securities laws,
    state law, foreign law or common law, in favor of any Person(s), including but not limited to the Auditor Defendants and any
    other present or future parties in the Auditor Case, against any of the Defendants and/or other Released Parties, with respect
    to, arising out of, or relating in any way to the claims, allegations, transactions, and/or events that are the subject of
    the Litigation, and/or based upon liability for, or arising out of or relating in any way to the Settled Claims, are extinguished,
    discharged, barred, satisfied and/or otherwise unenforceable.   

(b)  
      All

    partial, comparative, or complete contribution, subrogation or indemnity, however denominated, based upon liability for, and/or
    arising out of or relating in any way to the Settled Claims, and the Court finds that all such claims are extinguished, discharged,
    satisfied and made unenforceable.   

(c)  
      In
    accord with the principles of 15 U.S.C.   78u-4(f)(7)(B), if there is a final verdict or judgment against any non-settling

    such Person shall be reduced by the greater of: (a) an amount
that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of the Released Parties; or (b) the Settlement Amount.   

(d)  
      Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, nothing in the Stipulation or this Order and Final Judgment shall apply to, bar, release or otherwise affect
    any claim or right to indemnification by any present or former     employee, officer or director of Keyuan, based on
    contractual indemnity, corporate by-laws, or Nevada law governing indemnification     of employees, directors and officers
    (including a claimed right for advancement of fees and costs), or any claim by any present     or former employee, officer or
    director of Keyuan for indemnity or contribution arising in or from any proceeding other than     this Litigation, that the
    Person asserting such claim would otherwise be entitled to assert in the absence of the Stipulation     and Settlement and
    the Court s Order and Final Judgment. Nor shall any of the foregoing apply to, bar, release or otherwise     affect any
    rights or claims by any of the Released Parties under any relevant insurance policies, including but not limited     to

as to all proceedings herein.  

12. Neither
this Order and Final Judgment, the Stipulation, nor any of the negotiations, documents or proceedings connected with them shall

(a)  
      described
    as, construed as, offered or received against any Defendant or any of the Released Parties as evidence of and/or construed as
    or deemed to be evidence of any presumption, concession or admission by any of them of the truth of any fact alleged by
    Plaintiffs in the Litigation, of the validity of any claim that was or could have been asserted in the Litigation, or of the

13. Exclusive
