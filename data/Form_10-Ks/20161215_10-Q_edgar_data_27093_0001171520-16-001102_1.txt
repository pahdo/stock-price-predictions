Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies  

Organization and Nature of Business   

Dataram Corporation ( Dataram 
or the  Company ) is an independent manufacturer and reseller of memory products and provider of performance solutions.
The Company provides customized memory solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and compatible memory for leading
brands including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Lenovo and Oracle as well as a line of memory products for Intel and AMD motherboard
based servers.  Dataram manufactures its memory in-house to meet three key criteria - quality, compatibility, and selection
- and tests its memory for performance and OEM compatibility as part of the production process.  The Company has memory designed
for over 50,000 systems and products that range from energy-efficient DDR4 modules to legacy SDR offerings.  The Company is
a CMTL Premier Participant and ISO 9001 (2008 Certified). Its products are fully compliant with JEDEC Specifications. 

Dataram s customers include a global
network of distributors, resellers, retailers, OEM customers and end users. 

Dataram competes with several large independent
memory manufacturers and OEMs.  The primary raw material used in producing memory boards is dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
chips. The purchase cost of DRAMs is the largest single component of the total cost of a finished memory board. Consequently, average
selling prices for computer memory boards are significantly dependent on the pricing and availability of DRAM chips. 

Liquidity and Going Concern   

The Company's condensed
consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.
For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, the Company incurred losses of approximately $1,221,000. The Company also incurred losses
of approximately $1,186,000 in fiscal 2017 s first six months ended October 31, 2016. 

If current and projected
revenue growth does not meet estimates, the Company may need to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity transactions
and further reduce certain overhead costs. The Company may require up to $1,000,000 of additional working capital over the next
twelve months to support operations. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will obtain any required financing or such financing
will be available to it on favorable terms. 

Based on the above,
there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.  

6   

Basis of Presentation   

The condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial statements and with Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and
footnotes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain
all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as
of October 31, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three
and six months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or for any
future period. 

These condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016. The Company s accounting policies are described in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016, and updated, as necessary,
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

On July 6, 2016, the Company filed a certificate
of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of
the Company s issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share on a one (1) for three (3) basis, effective
on July 8, 2016. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto give retrospective effect of the
reverse stock split for all periods presented. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
including deferred tax asset valuation allowances and certain other reserves and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates
and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in
the period they are determined to be necessary. Some of the more significant estimates made by management include allowance for
doubtful accounts and sales returns, reserve for inventory obsolescence, deferred income tax asset and related valuation allowance ,
 fair value of certain financial instruments, impairment assessment of carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
and other operating allowances and accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition   

Revenue is recognized when title passes upon
shipment of goods to customers. The Company s revenue earning activities involve delivering or producing goods. The following
criteria are met before revenue is recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, selling price
is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company does experience a minimal level of sales returns and
allowances for which the Company accrues a reserve at the time of sale. Estimated warranty costs are accrued by management upon
product shipment based on an estimate of future warranty claims. Such amounts were not material for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

7   

Net Loss per Share   

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing
the net loss available to common stock holders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding
during the period. The calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 includes
only the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. The denominator excludes the dilutive effect of common
shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of stock options, warrants, convertible notes and Series A, Series B and Series D preferred
shares as their effect would be anti-dilutive. 

Anti-dilutive securities consisted of the following
at October 31: 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, providing specific guidance on
the cash flow classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.  The amendments
in ASU 2016-18 require that a statement of cash flows (SCF) explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents,
and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents (collectively  CASH ). Therefore,
amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents
when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the SCF. The amendments in ASU 2016-18 are effective
for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. 
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
this accounting standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On August 26,
2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, seeking
to eliminate diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities, including both
business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (FASB ASC) 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on its
condensed consolidated financial statements.

The lease is for a term of 60 months and the Company is obligated to pay approximately $7,500 per month for the term of the lease.
The Company has an option to extend the lease for an additional two year period. The transactions described have been accounted
for as a sale-leaseback transaction. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of assets of approximately $103,000,

deferred gain of approximately $358,000 in proportion to the related gross rental charged to expense over the term of the lease,
60 months. The current portion of approximately $72,000 deferred gain was reflected in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion

12   

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, U.S. Gold Corp. s common stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of the Company s common stock or, at the election of any U.S. Gold

split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock on a 1 for 3 basis, which was effective with the State of Nevada
on July 8, 2016 and with The NASDAQ Stock Market at the open of trading on July 11, 2016. All share and per share amounts are reflective
of the reverse split. 

On July 29, 2016, the Company, Acquisition
Sub, U.S. Gold Corp. and Copper King, amended and restated the Merger Agreement to reflect the reverse split of the Company s
issued and outstanding common stock and to adjust certain aspects of the Merger Consideration and management consideration as defined

Overview  

Dataram Corporation (the  Compnay )is
incorporated in the State of Nevada and the Company s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol
 DRAM.  

On July 6, 2016, the Company filed a certificate
of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate a reverse
stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock on a 1 for 3 basis. The reverse stock split was effective
on July 11, 2016. Except where otherwise indicated, all per share amounts reflect the reverse stock split. 

The Company's principal executive office is
located at 777 Alexander Road, Suite 100, Princeton, New Jersey, 08540, its telephone number is (609) 799-0071 and its website
is located at http://www.dataram.com. 

The Company is an independent manufacturer
of memory products and provider of performance solutions. The Company provides customized memory solutions for original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs) and compatible memory for leading brands including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Lenovo and Oracle as well
as a line of memory products for Intel and AMD motherboard based servers.  Dataram manufactures its memory in-house to meet
three key criteria - quality, compatibility, and selection - and tests its memory for performance and original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) compatibility as part of the production process.  With memory designed for over 50,000 systems and with products that
range from energy-efficient DDR4 modules to legacy SDR offerings, Dataram offers one of the most complete portfolios in the industry.  The
Company is ISO 9001 (2008 Certified). Its products are fully compliant with JEDEC Specifications. 

The Company s customers include a global
network of distributors, resellers, retailers, OEM customers and end users. 

The Company competes with several other large
memory manufacturers and OEMs.  The primary raw material used in producing memory boards is dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
chips. The purchase cost of DRAMs is the largest single component of the total cost of a finished memory board. Consequently, average
selling prices for computer memory boards are significantly dependent on the pricing and availability of DRAM chips.

Proposed Acquisition of US Gold Corp  

On June 13, 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement to acquire U.S. Gold Corp., a Nevada corporation, and subsidiaries ( U.S. Gold ). U.S. Gold is an exploration
stage company that owns certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the Copper King gold and copper development project
located in the Silver Crown Mining District of southeast Wyoming (the  Copper King Project ) and mining claims related
to a gold development project in Eureka County, Nevada (the  Keystone Project ). 

The closing of the transaction is subject to
certain closing conditions, including shareholder approval and regulatory review. There is no assurance that such conditions will
be satisfied and approvals secured such that the transaction will be consummated. 

Business Segments  

Dataram has four business lines which provide
complementary solutions to the market.  Each has a different customer focus and  go to market  approach. 
They are: 

Dataram / Princeton Memory  : provides memory products that support enterprise / mission critical needs, custom
and high end memory solutions, consulting services, software solutions, and asset management / buy-back programs. Products are
sold direct and through partners into the enterprise, government and embedded markets.   

Micro Memory Bank (MMB)  : provides new and refurbished memory products which are not commonly available and, in
most cases, no longer available from the OEM. The business also provides brokerage and technology recycling services.   

MemoryStore.com  : the Memorystore.com web property provides  Dataram Value Memory  products used in
desktops, laptops, notebooks, servers, workstations, and MAC systems. Dataram Value Memory is specifically designed and tested
to meet industry standards and is compliant with JEDEC Specifications.   

18004Memory.com  : the 18004Memory.com web property provides new and refurbished memory products used in desktops,
laptops, notebooks, servers, MAC systems, printers, digital cameras, and mobile devices. This includes memory upgrades for all
major brands including Compaq, Dell, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba, IBM, Gateway, Sony, Fujitsu, and Acer.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As of October 31, 2016, the Company had cash
totaling approximately $63,000. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $291,000 for the six months ended
October 31, 2016. Net loss totaled approximately $1,186,000 which included approximately $429,000 of stock based compensation expense.
Trade receivables decreased by approximately $1,351,000 primarily the result of decreased revenues. Accounts payable decreased
by approximately $216,000. Other current assets increased by approximately $90,000 as a result of cost associated with the proposed
acquisition of US Gold Corp. 

Net cash used in financing activities for the
six months ended October 31, 2016 totaled approximately $285,000. The Company s repayments on its line of credit totaled
approximately $788,000. The Company issued Preferred Series B shares for cash proceeds of $503,000. 

If current and projected
revenue growth does not meet estimates, the Company may need to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity transactions
and further reduce certain overhead costs. The Company may require up to $1,000,000 of additional working capital over the next
twelve months to support operations. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will obtain any required financing or such financing
will be available to it on favorable terms. 

16   

Based on the above,
there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.  

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable
operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of October 31, 2016 are as follows: 

The Company has no other material commitments. 

Results of Operations  

Revenues for the three month period ended October
31, 2016 were $4,679,000 compared to revenues of $6,051,000 for the three month period ended October 31, 2015. Revenues for the
first six months of the current fiscal year were $9,594,000 compared to revenues of $13,388,000 for the comparable prior year period.
The decline in revenues for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decline in average selling
prices of approximately 36% from the comparable prior year periods. 

Cost of sales for the three and six months
ended October 31, 2016 were $3,829,000 and $8,018,000, respectively versus $4,848,000 and $10,783,000, respectively in the prior
year comparable periods. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the three and six months October 31, 2016 were 82% and 84%,
respectively of revenues versus 80% and 81% of revenues for the same respective prior year periods. The decrease in gross margin
as a percent of sales is a result of the Company trying to protect market share in an environments of declining selling prices. 

Engineering expense in the three and six months
ended October 31, 2016 were approximately $42,000 and $98,000, respectively, which is comparable to $46,000 and $100,000 for the
same respective prior year periods. 

Selling, general and administrative (S,G A)
expense for the three and six month period ended October 31, 2016 totaled $1,025,000 and $2,584,000, respectively, compared to
$1,280,000 and $2,684,000 for the same prior year periods. The Company has reduced annualized S,G A overhead cost by approximately
$1,000,000 in the prior twelve months. The decrease is the result of reduction in employees and other cost. The Company recorded
approximately $429,000 of stock based compensation charges in the current years fiscal first quarter ended July 31, 2016 compared
to $213,000 in the comparable prior year period. 

17   

Other income (expense), net for the three and
six month period ended October 31, 2016 totaled approximately $43,000 and $84,000 of expense, respectively, compared to expense
of approximately $47,000 and $109,000, for the same prior year periods. Other expense in the three month period ended October 2016
consisted of approximately 40,000 of interest expense and approximately $3,000 of foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense
for the six months ended October 31, 2016 consisted of interest expense of approximately $79,000 and approximately $5,000 of foreign
currency transaction losses. Other income (expense) in the three month period ended October 31, 2015 consisted of approximately
$54,000 of interest expense and approximately $7,000 of foreign currency transaction gains. For the six month period ended October
31, 2015 other income (expense) consisted of approximately $116,000 of interest expense and approximately $7,000 of foreign currency
transaction gains. 

In May 2015, Dataram filed an application with
the state of New Jersey (NJ) for the transfer of the NJ State tax benefit associated with its State of New Jersey specific Net
Operating Losses (NOLs).  The Company executed a contract of sale and received proceeds of approximately $190,000 on December
9, 2015.

None.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

During December 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
published a Commission Statement in the form of Financial Reporting Release No. 60 which encouraged that all registrants discuss
their most  critical accounting policies  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both important to the portrayal of a
company s financial condition and results, and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While the Company s
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report, management believes the following accounting policies to be critical: 

Revenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized
when title passes upon shipment of goods to customers. The Company s revenue earning activities involve delivering or producing
goods. The following criteria are met before revenue is recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment has
occurred, selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company does experience a minimal level
of sales returns and allowances for which the Company accrues a reserve at the time of sale in accordance with the Revenue Recognition
  Right of Return Topic of the FASB ASC. Estimated warranty costs are accrued by management upon product shipment based on
an estimate of future warranty claims. 

Research and Development - Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred, including Company-sponsored research and development and costs of patents and other intellectual
property that have no alternative future use when acquired and in which we had an uncertainty in receiving future economic benefits.
Development costs of a computer software product to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release
to customers. Technological feasibility of a computer software product is established when all planning, designing, coding and
testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications (including
functions, features and technical performance requirements) are completed. 

Income Taxes - The Company utilizes the asset
and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the Expenses   Income Taxes Topic
of the FASB ASC. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers certain tax planning strategies in its assessment as to
the recoverability of its tax assets. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the tax rate changes. The Company recognizes,
in its consolidated financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained
on audit, based on technical merits of the position. There are no material unrecognized tax positions in the financial statements. 

18   

Goodwill   The carrying value of goodwill
is not amortized, but is tested annually as of March 31 as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable using a two-step process. As of April 30, 2016, management has concluded that no impairment
of goodwill is required. 

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including deferred income tax asset valuation
allowances and certain other reserves and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically
and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.
Some of the more significant estimates made by management include the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, the deferred
income tax asset valuation allowance and other operating allowances and accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK  

The Company does not invest in market risk
sensitive instruments. At times, the Company's cash equivalents consist of overnight deposits with banks and money market accounts.
The Company's objective in connection with its investment strategy is to maintain the security of its cash reserves without taking
market risk with principal. 

The Company purchases and sells primarily in
U.S. dollars. The Company sells in foreign currency (primarily Euros) to a limited number of customers and as such incurs some
foreign currency risk. At any given time, approximately 5% to 40% of the Company s accounts receivable are denominated in
currencies other than U.S. dollars. At present, the Company does not purchase forward contracts as hedging instruments, but could
do so as circumstances warrant. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. 

While we believe our disclosure controls and procedures and our
internal control over financial reporting are adequate, no system of controls can prevent errors and fraud. A control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives
will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some people, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance
with its policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error
or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Subject to the limitations above, management believes that the condensed
consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report, fairly present in all material respects
our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. 

19   

Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING  

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, there were no changes
to our internal control over financial reporting.
