    UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND UNITED AIRLINES, INC.    
     COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)    
  United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  UAL  or the  Company ) is a holding company and its
principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  United ). This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is a combined report of UAL and United, including their respective consolidated
financial statements. As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly
100% of UAL s revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL s assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their
individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words  we,   our, 
 us,  and the  Company  in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.      The UAL and United unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements shown here have been prepared as required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Some information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements that
comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the SEC. The financial statements include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments and other
adjustments, which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations. The UAL and United financial statements should be read together with the information included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company s quarterly financial data is subject to seasonal fluctuations and historically its second and third quarter financial results, which reflect
higher travel demand, are better than its first and fourth quarter financial results.       NOTE 1 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
      The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created a new Topic
606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the
Accounting Standards Codification, and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Under the new standard, certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets, such as
airline change fees and baggage fees, are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component. In addition, the change fees which were previously recognized when received, will likely be
recognized when transportation is provided. The Company is evaluating other possible impacts on its consolidated financial statements.      In
February 2016, the FASB amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created a new Topic 842,  Leases  ( Topic 842 ). The guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases (with
the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date and recognize expenses on their income statements similar to the current Topic 840,  Leases . It is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2018, and early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors are required to adopt Topic 842 using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical
expedients. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and believes this standard will have a significant impact on its consolidated balance sheets.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update  No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU  2016-09 )  .  The update requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies, which arise due to differences between the measure of compensation expense and
the amount deductible for tax purposes, to be recorded directly through earnings as a component of income tax expense. Under current GAAP, these differences are generally recorded in additional paid-in capital and thus have no impact on net income.
The change in treatment of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will also impact the computation of diluted earnings per share, and the cash flows associated with those items will be classified as
  
         13   

Table of Contents  

operating activities on the condensed statements of consolidated cash flows. Additionally, entities will be permitted to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the
recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required under current GAAP, or recognized when they occur. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU  2016-09  to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update  No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU  2016-15 ).  The update amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 230,  Statement of Cash Flows , and
clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments in this update
are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU  2016-15  to
have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.      The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
 No. 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).  Under the standard, investments for
which fair value is measured at net asset value ( NAV ) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient will no longer be categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2016. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $202 million of such investments as part of its Short-term investments balance sheet total. In addition, pension plan investments measured at NAV per share will no longer be categorized within the
fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.9 billion of such investments.       NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER
SHARE       The computations of UAL s basic and diluted earnings per share are set forth below (in millions, except per share amounts):
      
    The number of antidilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share amounts was not
material. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, UAL repurchased 5 million and 48 million shares of UAL common stock in open market transactions, respectively, for $255 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $2 billion remaining to purchase shares under its existing share repurchase authority. UAL may repurchase shares through the open market, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or
accelerated share repurchase transactions from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws. UAL will repurchase shares of UAL common stock subject to prevailing market conditions, and may discontinue such repurchases at any time. See
Part II, Item 2,  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  of this report for additional information.

(a) UAL and United amounts are substantially the same except for an additional gain related to investments and other of $1 million at United for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.      (b) Includes deferred income tax expense of $180 million that will remain in AOCI until all fuel
derivatives which are designated for hedge accounting are settled.      (c) Deferred tax balance was offset by the Company s valuation
allowance.      (d) This AOCI component is included in the computation of net periodic pension and other postretirement costs (see Note 5 of this
report for additional information).   
         15   

Table of Contents  

   Prior to the release of the valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded $180
million of deferred income tax expense adjustments in AOCI related to losses on fuel hedges designated for hedge accounting. This deferred income tax expense of $180 million will remain in AOCI until all fuel derivatives which are designated for
hedge accounting are settled. Currently, our fuel hedges that are designated for hedge accounting have settlement dates through December 2016. If we do not enter into and designate additional fuel derivative contracts for hedge accounting by the end
of 2016, a non-cash income tax expense of $180 million will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016.       NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES
      The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 36% which represented a blend of
federal, state and foreign taxes and the impact of certain nondeductible items. During 2015, after considering all positive and negative evidence, the Company concluded that its deferred income taxes would more likely than not be realized. The
Company released substantially all of its valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in a $3.2 billion benefit in its provision for income taxes.       NOTE 5 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS         Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefit Plans.   The Company s net periodic benefit cost includes the following components (in millions):       
    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company contributed $240 million and $400 million,
respectively, to its U.S. domestic tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans.        Plan Curtailments.   As part of the recently
ratified contract with the Association of Flight Attendants ( AFA ), the Company amended its postretirement medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the recognition of a one-time $47 million gain for
accelerated recognition of a prior service credit in the third quarter of 2016. The Company remeasured the plans  liabilities using an average weighted discount rate of 3.43% compared to the year-end 2015 weighted average discount rate of
4.52%. As a result of the amendments, remeasurements and curtailments, the projected benefit obligation of the plans increased by $49 million and Other comprehensive loss increased by $96 million, respectively.

     Share-Based Compensation.        During 2016, UAL granted share-based compensation awards pursuant to the United Continental Holdings, Inc. 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan. These share-based compensation awards include approximately 0.4
million stock options, 0.4 million shares of restricted stock and 1.9 million restricted stock units ( RSUs ).      The stock
options vest in one-third increments over either (i) the first three anniversaries of the date of grant (for seven-year term options) or (ii) the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the date of grant (for ten-year term options). The restricted
stock awards and the time-vested RSUs vest in one-third increments over the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. The time-vested RSUs are generally stock-settled for domestic employees and cash-settled for international employees based on
the 20-day average closing price of UAL common stock immediately prior to the vesting date. The remainder of the RSUs are performance-based and vest based on the Company s return on invested capital and the Company s relative improvement
in pre-tax margin for the three years ending December 31, 2018. If the applicable performance conditions are achieved, cash payments will be made after the end of the performance period based on the 20-day average closing price of UAL common
stock immediately prior to the vesting date. The Company accounts for the performance-based RSUs as liability awards.      The table below
presents information related to share-based compensation (in millions):       
      Profit Sharing Plans.   Substantially all employees participate in profit sharing based on a percentage of
pre-tax earnings, excluding special items, profit sharing expense and share-based compensation. Profit sharing percentages range from 5% to 20% depending on the work group, and in some cases profit sharing percentages vary above and below certain
pre-tax margin thresholds. Eligible U.S. co-workers in each participating work group receive a profit sharing payout using a formula based on the ratio of each qualified co-worker s annual eligible earnings to the eligible earnings of all
qualified co-workers in all domestic work groups. Eligible non-U.S. co-workers receive profit sharing based on the calculation under the U.S. profit sharing plan for management and administrative employees. Profit sharing expense is recorded as a
component of Salaries and related costs in the Company s statements of consolidated operations.

    NOTE 6 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    
  The table below presents disclosures about the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Company s
financial statements (in millions):       
        (a) In
accordance with the relevant accounting standards, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts
presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position. The investments measured using NAV are shares of mutual funds that invest in fixed-income
instruments including bonds, debt securities, and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The Company can redeem its shares at any time at NAV subject to a three-day settlement period.
      Available-for-sale investment maturities  - The short-term investments shown in the table above are classified as available-for-sale.
As of September 30, 2016, asset-backed securities have remaining maturities of less than one year to approximately 33 years, corporate debt securities have remaining maturities of less than one year to approximately six years and CDARS have
maturities of less than one year. U.S. government and other securities have maturities of less than one year to approximately three years. The EETC securities mature in 2019.      Derivative instruments and investments presented in the tables above have the same fair value as their carrying value. The table below presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial
instruments not presented in the tables above (in millions):       
 
         18   

Table of Contents  

   Fair value of the financial instruments included in the tables above was determined as follows:   

Description    
        
     Fair Value Methodology     

Cash and cash equivalents   
        
  The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these assets.   

Short-term investments and  Restricted cash   
        
  Fair value is based on (a) the trading prices of the investment or similar instruments, (b) an income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts into a
single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts when observable trading prices are not available, (c) internally-developed models of the expected future cash flows related to the securities, or (d) broker quotes
obtained by third-party valuation services.   

Fuel derivatives   
        
  Derivative contracts are privately negotiated contracts and are not exchange traded. Fair value measurements are estimated with option pricing models that employ observable inputs.
Inputs to the valuation models include contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, fuel price curves and measures of volatility, among others.   

Foreign currency derivatives   
        
  Fair value is determined with a formula utilizing observable inputs. Significant inputs to the valuation models include contractual terms, risk-free interest rates and forward
exchange rates.   

Debt   
        
  Fair values were based on either market prices or the discounted amount of future cash flows using our current incremental rate of borrowing for similar
liabilities.   
     NOTE 7 - HEDGING ACTIVITIES         Fuel Derivatives        The Company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements to
protect against increases in the price of fuel. The Company may restructure hedges in response to market conditions prior to their original settlement dates which may result in changes in hedge coverage levels and the potential recognition of gains
or losses on such hedge contracts. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had hedged approximately 13% of its projected fuel requirements (126 million gallons) for the remainder of 2016 with commonly used financial hedge instruments based on
aircraft fuel or crude oil. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had fuel hedges expiring through December 2016.      As required, the
Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing
regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of aircraft fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes.      Upon proper qualification, the Company accounts for certain fuel derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. All derivatives designated as hedges that meet certain requirements are granted hedge
accounting treatment. The types of instruments the Company utilizes that qualify for hedge accounting treatment typically include swaps, call options, collars (which consist of a purchased call option and a sold put option), four-way collars (a
collar with a higher strike sold call option and a lower strike purchased put option) and other combinations of options. Generally, utilizing hedge accounting, all periodic changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that are
considered to be effective are recorded in AOCI until the underlying fuel is consumed and recorded in fuel expense. The Company is exposed to the risk that its hedges may not be effective in offsetting changes in the cost of fuel and that its
hedges may not continue to qualify for hedge accounting. Hedge ineffectiveness results when the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument exceeds the change in the value of the Company s expected future cash outlay to purchase
and consume fuel. To the extent that the periodic changes in the fair value of the derivatives are not effective, that ineffectiveness is classified as Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net in the statements of consolidated
operations.   
         19   

Table of Contents  

   The Company also uses certain combinations of derivative contracts that are economic hedges but do not
qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. Additionally, the Company may enter into contracts at different times and later combine those contracts into structures designated for hedge accounting. As with derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,
the economic hedges and individual contracts are part of the Company s program to mitigate the adverse financial impact of potential increases in the price of fuel. The Company records changes in the fair value of these various contracts that
are not designated for hedge accounting to Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net in the statements of consolidated operations.      If
the Company settles a derivative prior to its contractual settlement date, then the cumulative gain or loss recognized in AOCI at the termination date remains in AOCI until the forecasted transaction occurs. In a situation where it becomes probable
that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, any gains and/or losses that have been recorded to AOCI would be required to be immediately reclassified into earnings. All cash flows associated with purchasing and settling derivatives are
classified as operating cash flows in the condensed statements of consolidated cash flows.      In addition to cash flow hedges, the Company from
time to time enters into fair value hedges related to its aircraft fuel inventory using derivatives such as swaps and futures contracts based on aircraft fuel. Under fair value hedge accounting, the Company records changes in the fair value of both
the hedging derivative and the hedged aircraft fuel inventory as fuel expense. The Company records ineffectiveness on fair value hedges as Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net in the statements of consolidated operations. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any fair value hedges.      The Company records each derivative instrument as a derivative asset
or liability (on a gross basis) in its consolidated balance sheets ,  and, accordingly, records any related collateral on a gross basis. The table below presents the fair value amounts of fuel derivative assets and liabilities and the location
of amounts recognized in the Company s financial statements.      The Company s derivatives were reported in its consolidated balance
sheets as follows (in millions):

Derivative Credit Risk and Fair Value        The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to its derivative instruments. While the Company records derivative instruments on a gross basis, the Company
monitors its net derivative position with each counterparty to monitor credit risk. Based on the fair value of our fuel derivative instruments, our counterparties may require us to post collateral when the price of the underlying commodity
decreases, and we may require our counterparties to provide us with collateral when the price of the underlying commodity increases. The Company did not hold or post collateral as of September 30, 2016. The Company had on deposit $26 million of
collateral with fuel derivative counterparties as of December 31, 2015. The collateral is recorded as Prepaid expenses and other on the Company s balance sheets.      We have master trading agreements with all of our fuel hedging counterparties that allow us to net our fuel hedge derivative positions. We have elected not to net the fair value positions recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets. The following table shows the potential net fair value positions (including fuel derivatives and related collateral) had we elected to offset. The table reflects offset at the counterparty level (in millions):

      Foreign Currency Derivatives        The Company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the Company s results of operations through changes in the dollar
value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Some of the Company s more significant foreign currency exposures include the Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, European euro, British pound and Japanese yen. At times, the
Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as options, collars and forward contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign currency. At September 30, 2016, the Company had foreign currency derivative contracts in place to hedge both
European euro denominated sales and Japanese yen denominated sales. The notional amount of the hedges equates to 16% of the Company s projected European euro denominated net cash inflows for the remainder of 2016; and 18% of the Company s
projected Japanese yen denominated net cash inflows for the remainder of 2016. Net cash relates primarily to passenger ticket sales inflows, partially offset by expenses paid in local currencies. At September 30, 2016, the fair value of the
Company s foreign currency derivatives was a liability of $1 million.

    NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES         Commitments.   As of September 30, 2016, United had firm commitments and options to purchase aircraft from The Boeing Company ( Boeing ) and Airbus S.A.S. ( Airbus )
presented in the table below:       
    The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery through 2024. For the remainder of 2016, United expects
to take delivery of seven Boeing 737NG aircraft and one Boeing  777-300ER  aircraft.      The table below
summarizes United s commitments as of September 30, 2016, which primarily relate to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and include other commitments primarily to acquire information technology
services and assets. Any new firm aircraft orders, including through the exercise of purchase options and purchase rights, will increase the total future capital commitments of the Company.   
   
    As of September 30, 2016, United had $1.7 billion in financing available through EETC transactions for the financing
of all of its aircraft deliveries scheduled for the remainder of 2016 and first half of 2017. See Note 9 of this report for additional information on aircraft financing. The Company has also secured backstop financing commitments from certain of its
aircraft manufacturers for a limited number of its future aircraft deliveries, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy the Company s capital commitments for its firm order aircraft and other related
capital expenditures.        Facility and Other Operating Leases.   In October 2016, United signed a seven year lease extension through
2024 with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to continue its use of terminals at Washington Dulles International Airport. The table below summarizes the Company s scheduled future minimum lease payments under facility operating
leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms of more than one year.       
      Guarantees.   As of September 30, 2016, United is the guarantor of approximately $1.9 billion in
aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing
bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with $1.4 billion of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases with the associated expense recorded on a

straight-line basis resulting in ratable accrual of the lease obligation over the expected lease term. The leasing arrangements associated with $376 million of these obligations are accounted for
as capital leases. All of these bonds are due between 2017 and 2038.      In the Company s financing transactions that include loans, the
Company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate
( LIBOR ), for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law, subject, in most cases, to obligations of the lenders to take certain limited steps to mitigate the requirement
for, or the amount of, such increased costs. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $2.5 billion of floating rate debt and $97 million of fixed rate debt, with remaining terms of up to 12 years, that are subject to these increased cost
provisions. In several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non-U.S. entities, with remaining terms of up to 12 years and an aggregate balance of $2.6 billion, the Company bears the risk of any change in tax laws that would
subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non-U.S. entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions.      As of
September 30, 2016, United is the guarantor of $171 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of United s regional carriers. The aircraft mortgage debt is subject to similar increased cost provisions as described above for the
Company s debt and the Company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees.        Labor Negotiations.  
As of September 30, 2016, United had approximately 87,500 active employees, of whom approximately 80% were represented by various U.S. labor organizations.      In January 2016, United s pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International, agreed to extend their contract through January 31, 2019. Increases in the pay and benefits
resulting from new pilot agreements could activate United pilot contract clauses requiring the Company to match contract terms. In March 2016, the Company s dispatchers, represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association, agreed
to extend their current contract through 2021. In April 2016, the fleet service, passenger service, storekeeper and other employees represented by the Int l Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ( IAM ) ratified seven new
contracts with the Company which extended the contracts through 2021. In August 2016, United s flight attendants, represented by the AFA, ratified a five-year joint collective bargaining agreement through 2021. In September 2016, the Company
reached a tentative agreement with the Int l Brotherhood of Teamsters (the  IBT ) for a six-year joint collective bargaining agreement with its technicians and related employees.   
   NOTE 9 - DEBT       As of September 30,
2016, a substantial portion of the Company s assets, principally aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. As of September 30, 2016, UAL and
United were in compliance with their debt covenants. As of September 30, 2016, United had its entire capacity of $1.35 billion available under the revolving credit facility of the Company s 2013 Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the
 Credit Agreement ).        EETCs   .  In September 2016 and June 2016, United created EETC pass-through trusts, each of
which issued pass-through certificates. The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes issued by United and secured by its aircraft. The Company records the debt obligation upon issuance of the
equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates represent fractional undivided interests in the respective pass-through trusts and are not obligations of United. The payment
obligations under the equipment notes are those of United. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates are initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until United issues equipment notes to
the trust, which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by United and are not reported as debt on our consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not
United s assets. Certain details of the pass-through trusts with proceeds received from issuance of debt in 2016 are as follows (in millions, except stated interest rate):

Table of Contents  

   In 2016, United borrowed approximately $272 million aggregate principal amount from various financial
institutions to finance the purchase of several aircraft delivered in 2016. The notes evidencing these borrowings, which are secured by the related aircraft, mature in 2028 and have interest rates comprised of LIBOR plus a specified margin.
       4.5% Convertible Notes due 2015.   In the first quarter of 2015, the holders of substantially all of the remaining $202 million
principal amount of the 4.5% Convertible Notes due 2015 exercised their conversion option resulting in the issuance of 11 million shares of UAL common stock.        6% Notes due 2026.   In the first quarter of 2015, UAL used cash to repurchase $18 million par value 6% Notes due 2026 (the  2026 Notes ) in market transactions. On April 1,
2015, UAL used cash to redeem, at par, the remaining $303 million balance of the 2026 Notes.        6% Notes due 2028.   In the first
quarter of 2015, UAL used cash to repurchase $13 million par value 6% Notes due 2028 (the  2028 Notes ) in market transactions. On May 1, 2015, UAL used cash to redeem, at par, the remaining $298 million balance of the 2028 Notes.

    NOTE 10 - SPECIAL ITEMS       For the three and nine months ended September 30, special items consisted of the following (in millions):       
    The fleet service, passenger service, storekeeper and other employees represented by the IAM ratified seven new contracts
with the Company which extended the contracts through 2021. The Company also reached a tentative agreement with the IBT. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $61 million ($39 million net of taxes) and
$171 million ($109 million net of taxes), respectively, of special charges primarily for payments to be made in conjunction with the IAM and IBT agreements described above. Also, as part of the recently ratified contract with the AFA, the Company
amended two of its flight attendant postretirement medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the recognition of a one-time $47 million gain ($30 million net of taxes) for accelerated recognition of a prior service
credit.      During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $13 million ($8 million net of taxes) and $27
million ($17 million net of taxes), respectively, of severance and benefit costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $28 million and $103 million, respectively, of severance and benefit costs. The
severance and benefit costs relate to a voluntary early-out program for the Company s flight attendants and other severance agreements. In 2014, more than 2,500 flight attendants elected to voluntarily separate from the Company for a severance
payment, with a maximum value of $100,000 per participant, based on years of service, with retirement dates through the end of 2016.      In April
2016, the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) announced that it will designate Newark as a Level 2 schedule-facilitated airport under the International Air Transport Association Worldwide Slot Guidelines effective October 30,
2016. The designation was associated with an updated demand and capacity analysis of Newark by the FAA. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company determined that the FAA s action impaired the entire value of its Newark slots because the
slots will no longer be the mechanism that governs take-off and landing rights. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $412 million special charge ($264 million net of taxes) to write off the intangible asset. The Newark slots served as part of the
collateral for the term loans under the Company s Credit Agreement and under the Second Amended and Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing Services Agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A. (the  Chase Agreement ). The Credit Agreement and the
Chase Agreement have been amended to remove the Newark slots as collateral with no replacement collateral required.      During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the City of Cleveland agreed to amend the lease, which runs through 2029, associated with certain excess airport terminal space (principally Terminal D) and related facilities at Hopkins International Airport. The
Company recorded an accrual for remaining payments under the lease for facilities that the Company no longer uses and will continue to incur costs under the lease without economic benefit to the Company. This liability was measured and recorded at
its fair value when the Company ceased its right to use such facilities leased to it pursuant to the lease. The Company recorded a net charge of $74 million ($47 million net of taxes) related to the amended lease.   
         25   

Table of Contents  

   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded gains and losses on
sale of assets and other special charges of $18 million ($12 million net of taxes) and $32 million ($20 million net of taxes), respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $48 million and $92
million, respectively, for integration costs, impairment of assets and other special gains and losses.      During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $8 million ($5 million net of taxes) of losses due to exchange rate changes in Venezuela applicable to funds held in local currency and recorded a $9 million ($6 million net of taxes) gain on the sale of
an affiliate.      During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded $61 million of losses due to exchange rate changes in Venezuela
applicable to funds held in local currency. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $134 million due to the write-off of the unamortized non-cash debt discount related to the extinguishment of the 2026
Notes and 2028 Notes. Both of the charges were recorded as part of Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net.        Accruals
       The accrual balance for severance and benefits was $34 million as of September 30, 2016, compared to $110 million as of
September 30, 2015. The severance-related accrual as of September 30, 2016 is expected to be mostly paid through 2016. The following is a reconciliation of severance accrual activity for the period:   

ITEM 2.   
   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.      
   Overview       United Continental Holdings,
Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  UAL  or the  Company ) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
 United ). This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is a combined report of UAL and United including their respective consolidated financial statements. As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to
activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL s revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire
balance of UAL s assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations
and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words  we,   our,   us,  and the  Company  in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.
     The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations, which utilize jet aircraft with at least 118
seats, and regional operations, which utilize smaller aircraft that are operated under contract by United Express carriers. The Company serves virtually every major market around the world, either directly or through participation in Star Alliance     , the world s largest airline alliance. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates more than 4,500
flights a day to 339 airports across five continents.       Third Quarter Financial Highlights    

Third quarter 2016 net income was $965 million, or $3.01 diluted earnings per share as compared to net income of $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per
share of $12.82 in the third quarter of 2015. A primary reason for the decline in net income is associated with the release of the income tax valuation allowance of $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015, combined with the recording of $545
million of income tax expense on the pre-tax income in 2016.      
         26   

Table of Contents  

Unrestricted liquidity at September 30, 2016 was $6.2 billion, including $1.35 billion of undrawn commitments under the Company s revolving
credit facility.          

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, UAL repurchased 5 million and 48 million shares of its common stock in open market
transactions, respectively, for $255 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $2 billion remaining to purchase shares under its existing share repurchase authority.
         Third Quarter Operational Highlights    

United achieved best third-quarter and best year-to-date on-time performance in its history.      

The Company took delivery of four new Boeing 737NG aircraft and one used Airbus A319 aircraft during the third quarter of 2016.
         Outlook       The Company expects full-year 2016 consolidated capacity to increase between 1.2% and 1.4% year-over-year.      The Company expects to drive $3.1 billion of incremental value by 2018. United anticipates to capture this value through benefits from improved operations by focusing on re-attracting premium customers,
reducing cost of irregular operations, reducing re-accommodations and improving schedule quality. In addition, the Company will introduce new products to its industry-leading existing portfolio of products such as our recently announced Polaris
business class seats and enhance revenue through various MileagePlus program initiatives. Finally, the Company plans to improve its cost structure through an upgauge and slimline seat program and ongoing sensible cost management.   
  In the first quarter of 2016, United reached contract extensions with its pilots and dispatchers. In the second quarter, United also reached amended
collective bargaining agreements with its Int l Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ( IAM ) represented employees. In the third quarter of 2016, United and the Association of Flight Attendants ( AFA )
ratified a five-year contract covering all of its flight attendants, and United reached a tentative agreement with the Int l Brotherhood of Teamsters ( IBT ) for a joint collective bargaining agreement with its technicians and related
employees. The costs associated with the ratification of all these agreements (excluding any impact from the IBT tentative agreement) is expected to add an additional approximate 2.3 points of non-fuel unit costs for full-year 2016, primarily due to
the pilots  agreement, and is expected to add an additional approximate 1.5 to 2.0 points of non-fuel unit costs for full-year 2017, primarily due to the AFA and IAM agreements. Increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new pilot
agreements could activate United pilot contract clauses requiring the Company to match contract terms. The Company cannot predict the outcome of ongoing and future negotiations with its unionized employee groups. Increases in the pay and benefits
resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have a material financial impact on the Company.      The price of jet fuel remains
volatile. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2016, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Company s annual fuel expense by approximately $93 million. To protect against increases in the prices of
aircraft fuel, the Company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
  The following discussion provides an analysis of results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.   
         27   

Table of Contents  

     Third Quarter 2016 Compared to Third Quarter 2015     
  The Company recorded net income of $965 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to net income of $4.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. A
primary reason for the decline in net income is associated with the release of the income tax valuation allowance of $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015, combined with the recording of $545 million of income tax expense on the pre-tax income
in 2016. The Company considers a key measure of its performance to be operating income, which was $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $1.9 billion for the third quarter of 2015, a $0.3 billion decrease year-over-year.

   The table below presents selected third quarter passenger revenue and operating data, broken out by
geographic region, expressed as year-over-year changes:       
    Consolidated passenger revenue in the third quarter of 2016 decreased $357 million, or 4.0% as compared to the year-ago
period. Third-quarter 2016 consolidated PRASM decreased 5.8% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The decline in PRASM was driven by factors including a strong U.S. dollar, lower surcharges, reductions from energy-related corporate travel, and
declining yields.        Operating Expenses        The table below includes data related to the Company s operating expenses for the three months ended September 30 (in millions, except for percentage changes):   
   
    Salaries and related costs increased $91 million, or 3.6%, in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the year-ago
period primarily due to higher pay rates and benefit expenses driven by new and extended collective bargaining agreements, an increase in employee incentive expenses due to improvements in operational performance and a 3.3% increase in average
full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by a decrease in profit sharing expense.

   Aircraft fuel expense decreased $331 million, or 17.1%, year-over-year primarily due to a 18.7% decrease in
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the year-ago period. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the year-ago period:       
    Regional capacity purchase was $572 million in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. Increased aircraft rent and
contractual rates were offset by a 3.9% reduction in capacity and a reduction in pass-through costs in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the year-ago period.      Depreciation and amortization increased $34 million, or 7.2%, in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to additions of new aircraft, conversions of operating leases to
capital leases, aircraft improvements and accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to several fleet types.      Aircraft maintenance
materials and outside repairs increased $27 million, or 6.4%, in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to the timing of maintenance events.      Other operating expenses increased $135 million, or 10.4%, in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in ground handling costs and other airport operations
cost, food and technology costs associated with the Company s enhanced customer experience initiatives, rate-driven increases in personnel-related expenses, increases in marketing expenses related to the 2016 Summer Olympics and increases in
other purchased services.      Details of the Company s special charges include the following for the three months ended September 30

    In the third quarter of 2016, Miscellaneous, net did not include any gains or losses from derivatives not qualifying for
hedge accounting as compared to losses of $67 million in the year-ago period. Foreign currency losses were approximately $4 million and $81 million in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Third quarter 2015 foreign currency results
include a $61 million loss related to the Company s cash holdings in Venezuela. See Note 10 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.

report for information related to income taxes.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         First Nine Months 2016 Compared to First Nine Months 2015        The Company recorded net
income of $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to net income of $6.5 billion in the first nine months of 2015. A primary reason for the decline in net income is associated with the release of the income tax valuation allowance
of $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015, combined with the recording of $1.1 billion of income tax expense on the pre-tax income in 2016. The Company considers a key measure of its performance to be operating income, which was $3.3 billion for
the first nine months of 2016, as compared to $4.1 billion for the first nine months of 2015, a $0.8 billion decrease year-over-year. Significant components of the Company s operating results for the nine months ended September 30 are as

     Operating Revenue        The table below shows year-over-year comparisons by type of operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30 (in millions, except for percentage changes):   
   
    The table below presents selected passenger revenue and operating data, broken out by geographic region, expressed as
year-over-year changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015:       
    Consolidated passenger revenue in the first nine months of 2016 decreased $1.4 billion or 5.4%, as compared to the
year-ago period. For the first nine months of 2016, consolidated PRASM decreased 6.6% compared to the year-ago period. The decline in PRASM was driven by factors including a strong U.S. dollar, lower surcharges, reductions from energy-related
corporate travel, and declining yields.      Cargo revenue decreased $80 million or 11.3%, in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the
year-ago period due to lower freight yields and lower mail volumes year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in freight volumes. Freight yields were negatively impacted as air freighter competitors increased capacity in response to lower fuel
prices. Another contributing factor to the year-over-year decrease was a U.S. West Coast port labor dispute that helped increase air freight results in the first quarter of 2015. The labor dispute was resolved during the first quarter of 2015.
     Other operating revenue in the first nine months of 2016 increased $116 million or 3.8%, as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to
the impact of the Second Amended and Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing Services Agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A., which became effective in the third quarter of 2015.

     Operating Expenses        The table below includes data related to the Company s operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30 (in millions, except for percentage changes):   
   
    Salaries and related costs increased $418 million or 5.7%, in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the year-ago
period primarily due to higher pay rates and benefit expenses driven by new and extended collective bargaining agreements, an increase in employee incentive expenses due to improvements in operational performance and a 1.8% increase in average
full-time equivalent employees.      Aircraft fuel expense decreased $1.6 billion or 27.9%, year-over-year primarily due to a 27.9% decrease in
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the year-ago period. 2016 fuel expense includes the benefit of a $20 million fuel tax refund. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft
fuel cost per gallon in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the year-ago period:       
    Regional capacity purchase decreased $80 million or 4.6%, in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the year-ago
period primarily due to a decrease in regional capacity and a decrease in one-time start-up and exit costs, partially offset by contractual rate increases and increases in performance incentive payments.   
  Depreciation and amortization increased $130 million or 9.7%, in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to
additions of new aircraft, conversions of operating leases to capital leases, aircraft improvements and accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to several fleet types.      Aircraft rent decreased $59 million, or 10.2%, in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased
aircraft, lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft and lease expirations.      Other operating expenses increased $216 million, or 5.7%, in
the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in ground handling costs and other airport operations cost, food and technology costs associated with the Company s enhanced customer experience
initiatives, rate-driven increases in personnel-related expenses, increases in marketing expenses related to the 2016 Summer Olympics and increases in other purchased services.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    
    Current Liquidity        As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had $4.9 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Company also had $124 million of
restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for letters of credit and estimated future workers  compensation claims. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had its entire commitment capacity of $1.35 billion under
the revolving credit facility of the Company s 2013 Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) available for letters of credit or borrowings.      As is the case with many of our principal competitors, we have a high proportion of debt compared to capital and a deficit in working capital. We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including
debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities, and pension funding obligations. At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $11.5 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.1
billion that will become due in the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. As of September 30, 2016, our current
liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $5.3 billion. However, approximately $6.7 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent
revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not actual cash outlays. The deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity or operations.

   As of September 30, 2016, United had firm commitments and options to purchase aircraft from The Boeing
Company ( Boeing ) and Airbus S.A.S. ( Airbus ) presented in the table below:       
    The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery through 2024. For the remainder of 2016, United expects
to take delivery of seven Boeing 737NG aircraft and one Boeing  777-300ER  aircraft.      As of
September 30, 2016, UAL and United have total capital commitments primarily related to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and acquisition of information technology services and assets of approximately
$22.6 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion, $4.5 billion, $4.1 billion, $3.3 billion, $2.6 billion and $6.9 billion are due in the last three months of 2016 and for the full year for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and thereafter, respectively. Any
new firm aircraft orders, including through the exercise of purchase options and purchase rights, will increase the total future capital commitments of the Company.      As of September 30, 2016, United has $1.7 billion in financing available through enhanced equipment trust certificates ( EETC ) transactions for the financing of all of its aircraft
deliveries scheduled for the remainder of 2016 and first half of 2017. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on aircraft financing. The Company has also secured backstop
financing commitments from certain of its aircraft manufacturers for a limited number of its future aircraft deliveries, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to satisfy the Company s capital commitments for its
firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures.      As of September 30, 2016, a substantial portion of the Company s
assets, principally aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. We must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our
significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines.      In September 2016, United agreed to a seven year lease extension through 2024 with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to continue its use of terminals at Washington Dulles International
Airport. See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.        Credit
Ratings.   As of the filing date of this report, UAL and United had the following corporate credit ratings:

    * The credit agency does not issue corporate credit ratings for subsidiary entities.    
    These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could
restrict the availability or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.        Sources and Uses of Cash     
    Operating Activities.   Cash flow provided by operations was $4.9 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015. Operating income for the first nine months of 2016 decreased $0.8 billion versus the year-ago period. However, operating income in 2016 was affected by the $0.4 billion non-cash impairment of the Newark slots. In regard to
  
         35   

Table of Contents  

year-over-year changes in working capital items, frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles decreased by approximately $0.3 billion due to increased utilization of
pre-purchased miles, which was offset by the change in payables and accrued liabilities. Other changes in working capital items were largely offsetting in the first nine months of 2016 versus the first nine months of 2015. Significant cash payments
in 2016 included $0.7 billion in profit sharing and $0.4 billion in pension funding.        Investing Activities.   Capital expenditures
were $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and
fleet-related costs. In June 2015, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we invested $100 million for an ownership stake of approximately five percent in Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras S.A., Brazil s third-largest airline, which provides a range
of customer benefits including codesharing of flights (subject to government approval), joint loyalty-program participation and expanded connection opportunities on routes between the U.S. and Brazil, a key market for United, in addition to other
points in North and South America.        Financing Activities.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made
debt and capital lease payments of $1.0 billion.      In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, United completed two EETC offerings
for a total principal amount of $2.0 billion. Of the $2.0 billion, United has received and recorded $321 million of proceeds as debt as of September 30, 2016. United expects to receive all proceeds from the pass-through trusts by the end of the
second quarter of 2017. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on EETC pass-through trusts.      In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, United borrowed approximately $272 million aggregate principal amount from various financial institutions to finance the purchase of several aircraft
delivered in 2016. The notes evidencing these borrowings, which are secured by the related aircraft, mature in 2028 and have interest rates comprised of the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a specified margin.   
  In the first quarter of 2015, the holders of substantially all of the remaining $202 million principal amount of United s 4.5% Convertible Notes due
2015 exercised their conversion option resulting in the issuance of 11 million shares of UAL common stock.      In the first quarter of 2015, UAL
used cash to repurchase $18 million par value 2026 Notes in market transactions. On April 1, 2015, UAL used cash to redeem, at par, the remaining $303 million balance of the 2026 Notes.      In the first quarter of 2015, UAL used cash to repurchase $13 million par value 2028 Notes in market transactions. On May 1, 2015, UAL used cash to redeem, at par, the remaining $298 million balance
of the 2028 Notes.      In the first nine months of 2015, United issued $0.9 billion of debt related to a 2014 EETC offering to finance new
aircraft.      In the first nine months of 2015, United borrowed approximately $480 million aggregate principal amount from various financial
institutions to finance the purchase of several aircraft delivered in 2015. The notes evidencing these borrowings, which are secured by the related aircraft, have maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2027 and interest rates comprised of LIBOR plus a
specified margin.      As of September 30, 2016, United had its entire capacity of $1.35 billion available under the revolving credit
facility of the Company s Credit Agreement. See Note 11 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ) for additional information on the terms of the Credit Agreement.
     The obligations of United under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on certain international route authorities between certain
specified cities, certain take-off and landing rights and related assets of United. Certain covenants in the Credit Agreement and in the Company s indentures are summarized in Note 11 of the 2015 Annual Report. The Company was in compliance
with all of these covenants as of September 30, 2016.        Share Repurchase Programs.   In the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, UAL repurchased 5 million and 48 million shares of UAL common stock in open market transactions, respectively, for $255 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $2
billion remaining to purchase shares under its existing share repurchase authority.   
         36   

Table of Contents  

   UAL may repurchase shares through the open market, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or
accelerated share repurchase transactions from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws. UAL will repurchase shares of UAL common stock subject to prevailing market conditions, and may discontinue such repurchases at any time.
See Part II, Item 2,  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  of this report for additional information.   
    Commitments, Contingencies and Liquidity Matters.   As described in the 2015 Annual Report, the Company s liquidity may be adversely
impacted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, obligations associated with fuel hedge settlements and related collateral requirements, pension funding obligations, reserve requirements associated with credit card processing
agreements, guarantees, commitments and contingencies.      As of September 30, 2016, United is the guarantor of $171 million of aircraft
mortgage debt issued by one of United s regional carriers.      See the 2015 Annual Report and Notes 5, 7, 8 and 9 to the financial

   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.         There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in Part II, Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in our 2015 Annual Report
except as follows:       Aircraft Fuel . As of September 30, 2016, the Company had hedged approximately 13% of its projected fuel
requirements (126 million gallons) for the remainder of 2016 with commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or crude oil. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had fuel hedges expiring through December 2016.   
  At September 30, 2016, fuel derivatives were in a net liability position of $4 million. See Note 7 to the financial statements included in Part I,
Item 1 of this report for additional information related to fuel hedges.      The fuel derivative portfolio is comprised of many individual
derivative contracts (primarily option contracts) on multiple underlying commodities and entered into at various points in time, resulting in a wide range of strike prices with several hedge counterparties. The table below provides a view of the
economic impact of the fuel derivative portfolio on the Company s fuel costs given significant moves (up to  +/-30%)  in market fuel prices after September 30, 2016 through the end of the year (in
millions).       
        (a) Projected
using equal shifts in spot and forward prices for aircraft fuel and crude oil underlying hedge contracts at September 30, 2016 levels.   
  (b) Projections based on an average forward price of $1.43 per gallon, excluding taxes and other delivery costs and estimated consumption of 1.0 billion
gallons for the three months ending December 31, 2016.      (c) Change in projected cash gain/(loss) on existing fuel derivatives as of
September 30, 2016. Includes all fuel derivatives whether or not the fuel derivatives are designated for hedge accounting. Within these price ranges, the Company would neither receive nor post collateral.

    Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures        The Company maintains controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to conclude with reasonable assurance that UAL s and United s disclosure controls and procedures
were designed and operating effectively to report the information each company is required to disclose in the reports they file with the SEC on a timely basis. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
UAL and United have concluded that as of September 30, 2016, disclosure controls and procedures of each of UAL and United were effective.   
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting during the Quarter Ended September 30, 2016     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in UAL s or United s internal control over financial reporting that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, their internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f)  under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

ITEM 1A.   
   RISK FACTORS.         See Part I, Item 1A.,
 Risk Factors,  of the 2015 Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A.,  Risk Factors  of the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (the  Second Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q ) for a detailed
discussion of the risk factors affecting UAL and United. The disclosures below include updates to certain risk factor disclosures included in the 2015 Annual Report, which are in addition to, and not in lieu of, those disclosures contained in the
2015 Annual Report and the Second Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q.        Union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related
disruptions, as well as the integration of United s workforces in connection with the Company s merger transaction in 2010, could adversely affect the Company s operations and could result in increased costs that could have a material
financial impact on the Company.        United is a highly unionized company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries
had approximately 87,500 active employees, of whom approximately 80% were represented by various U.S. labor organizations.      The successful
integration of United s workforces in connection with the Company s merger transaction in 2010 and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating employee groups and maintaining productive
employee relations. In order to fully integrate the Company s pre-merger represented employee groups, the Company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group. The process for integrating the labor groups
is governed by a combination of the Railway Labor Act (the  RLA ), the McCaskill-Bond Amendment, and where applicable, the existing provisions of collective bargaining agreements and union policies. A delay in or failure to integrate
employee groups presents the potential for increased operating costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect the Company s operations.      The Company has reached joint collective bargaining agreements with all but one of its employee groups since the merger transaction in 2010. Only the Company s technicians and related employees
remain without a combined collective bargaining agreement. The Company has reached a tentative agreement with its technicians and related employees for a joint collective bargaining agreement and will submit it for ratification by the union s
membership. The Company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of these labor negotiations will be achieved.      Union
disputes and other labor-related actions can disrupt the Company s operations. There is a risk that unions or individual employees might still pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the
Company s merger transaction in 2010. There is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns, work-to-rule campaigns, sick-outs or other actions designed to disrupt the Company s normal
operations, in an attempt to pressure the Company in collective bargaining negotiations. Although the RLA makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self-help, and the Company can seek injunctive relief against
premature self-help, such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined. In addition, joint collective bargaining agreements with the Company s represented employee groups increase the Company s labor costs, which increase
could have a material financial impact on the Company.      See Notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Note 8 to the financial statements included in this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs.

ITEM 2.   
   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.         (a) None      (b) None      (c) The following table presents repurchases of UAL common stock made in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016:       
    (a) In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, UAL repurchased approximately 5 million
and 48 million shares of UAL common stock in open market transactions, respectively, for $255 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. The repurchases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily pursuant to the
Company s previous $3 billion share repurchase authority, which is now exhausted.      As of September 30, 2016, the
Company had approximately $2 billion remaining to purchase shares under its $2 billion share repurchase authority that was approved in July 2016. UAL may repurchase shares through the open market, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or
accelerated share repurchase transactions from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws. UAL will repurchase shares of UAL common stock subject to prevailing market conditions, and may discontinue such repurchases at any time.
     (b) The table does not include shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due upon the vesting of
restricted stock units. The United Continental Holdings, Inc. 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. However, this plan does not specify a
maximum number of shares that may be withheld for this purpose. A total of 380 shares were withheld under this plan in the third quarter of 2016 at an average share price of $45.52. These shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations may be deemed to be  issuer purchases  of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item.   
  (c) Average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and excludes commission.

are subject to the terms and conditions specified herein (the  Options ) and that are granted to you under the United Continental Holdings, Inc. 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Plan ). The Options are not intended to
qualify as  incentive stock options  (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code )).  
 SECTION 1.  The Plan.  This Award is made pursuant to the Plan, all the terms of which are hereby incorporated in this Award
Notice. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Award Notice, the terms of the Plan shall govern.

meanings as used or defined in the Plan. As used in this Award Notice, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:  
   Cause   shall have the meaning set forth in the severance plan of United Continental Holdings, Inc. applicable to the
recipient of this Award, as in effect on the date hereof.      Vesting Date   means the date on which your rights with
respect to all or a portion of the Options may become fully vested and exercisable, as provided in Section 3(a) of this Award Notice.

(b)  Exercise of Options.  Options, to the extent that they have vested, may be
exercised, in whole or in part (but for the purchase of whole Shares only), by delivery to the administrator of the Company s equity compensation programs of (i) a written or electronic notice, complying with the applicable procedures
established by the Committee or the Company, stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Options are thereby exercised and (ii) full payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the Shares with respect to which the Options are thereby
exercised, in accordance with Section 3(c) of this Award Notice. The notice shall be signed by you or any other person then entitled to exercise the Options. The Company may also establish procedures for you to provide notice of exercise
through a third party administrator. Upon exercise and full payment of the Exercise Price for Shares with respect to which the Options are thereby exercised, the Company shall deliver to you or your legal representative one Share for each
Option with respect to which you have exercised and paid.   (c)  Payment . No Shares shall be delivered pursuant to the
exercise of the Option until payment in full of the aggregate Exercise Price is received by the Company, and you have paid to the Company (or the Company has withheld in accordance with Section 6 of this Award Notice)) an amount equal to any
Federal, state, local and foreign income and employment taxes required to be withheld. Such payments may be made, as elected by you, either (i) in cash, (ii) by delivery to the Company (either actual delivery or by attestation procedures established
by the Company) of Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date of exercise, equal to the aggregate Exercise Price payable pursuant to the Option by reason of such exercise, (iii) by authorizing the Company to withhold
whole Shares which would otherwise be delivered having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date of exercise, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy such obligation, (iv) except as may be prohibited by applicable law, in cash by a
broker-dealer acceptable to the Company to whom you have submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise or (v) by a combination of (i), (ii) and (iii).

             following your Termination of Employment as a result of death or Disability, (ii)              following your

encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company, provided that the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance.

applicable withholding taxes in accordance. You may elect to satisfy your obligations to advance the applicable withholding taxes by any of the following means: (i) a cash payment to the Company; (ii) delivery to the Company (either

equal to the applicable withholding taxes; (iii) authorizing the Company to withhold whole Shares which would otherwise be delivered to you upon exercise of the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the Tax Date, equal to
the applicable withholding taxes; (iv) except as may be prohibited by applicable law, a cash payment by a broker-dealer acceptable to the Company to whom you have submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise or (v) any combination of (i), (ii)
and (iii). [Shares to be delivered or withheld may not have a Fair Market Value in excess of the minimum amount of the applicable withholding taxes.] Any fraction of a Share which

of any required consents that the Committee may determine to be necessary or advisable (including, without limitation, your consenting to the Company s supplying to any third-party record keeper of the Plan such personal information as the
Committee deems advisable to administer the Plan).    (b)  Legends.  The Company may affix to certificates for Shares issued
pursuant to this Award Notice any legend that the Committee determines to be necessary or advisable (including to reflect any restrictions to which you may be subject under any applicable securities laws). The Company may advise the transfer
agent to place a stop order against any legended Shares.    SECTION 8.  Successors and Assigns of the Company.  The terms and
conditions of this Award Notice shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns.  
 SECTION 9.  Committee Discretion.  The Committee shall have full and plenary discretion with respect to any actions to be taken

  Insert Remaining Dates   shall be forfeited.

 (b)  Cash Settlement of RSUs . The RSUs granted to you pursuant to this Award will be settled in cash within 60 days following the date
the RSUs become vested. You shall receive a lump sum cash payment upon settlement, in accordance with the terms of this Award Notice, equal to the Fair Market Value on the date the RSUs became vested, which in the case of Sections 3(a)(iii) and
3(a)(iv) is the date of your Termination of Employment, multiplied by the number of RSUs that are settled at such time. Upon settlement, a number of RSUs equal to the number of Shares represented thereby shall be extinguished and such number of RSUs
will no longer be considered to be held by you for any purpose.    SECTION 4.  Forfeiture of RSUs.  Unless the Committee determines
otherwise, and except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Award Notice, if the Vesting Date with respect to any RSUs awarded to you pursuant to this Award Notice has not occurred prior to the date of your Termination of Employment, your
rights with respect to such RSUs shall immediately terminate upon your Termination of Employment, and you will be entitled to no further payments or benefits with respect thereto.

SECTION 6.  Non-Transferability of RSUs.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in its
discretion and notwithstanding clause (ii) of Section 10(a) of the Plan, prior to the date that they become vested, RSUs may not be sold, assigned, alienated, transferred, pledged, attached or otherwise encumbered by you, otherwise than by
will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company, provided that the designation of a beneficiary
