NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

JACC
Studios Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 24, 2014. The Company is in the development
stage whose purpose is to provide channels for the Chinese online game developers and operators to have access to the North American
market, provide English translation and re-production for Chinese online game developers and operators, assist them in user data
tracking, and help promote their games.  

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Development
Stage Company    

The
Company is considered to be in the development stage as defined in ASC 915   Development Stage Entities.  
The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to the development of its business plans. The Company has elected to
adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of
Certain Financial Reporting Requirements; and does not present or disclose inception-to-date information and other remaining
disclosure requirements of Topic 915.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain
all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual
financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements
contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the
Company as  September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of
operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the
full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Form S-1/A for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed
with the SEC on May 2, 2016.  

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

Start-Up
Costs    

In
accordance with ASC 720,   Start-up Costs ,  the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up
and organization of the Company.  

Cash

Cash
includes cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception,
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant
risk of loss in value.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income
Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2014, the
Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.  

Fair
Value Measurements    

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which  defines
fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure
of fair value measurements.  

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis,
which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value:

prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level
2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable  

Level
3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)  

The
Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.  

NOTE
3 - GOING CONCERN    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has not generated any revenues
since inception and sustained an accumulated net loss of $43,329 for the period from inception to September 30, 2016. These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a
reasonable period of time.  The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other
things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties.  No assurance can be
given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
4 - INCOME TAXES   

The
reconciliation of income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the
Company s effective tax rate is as follows:  

Income tax benefit at statutory rate    
                
     $  (6,170  )  
 
     Change in valuation allowance    
                
        6,170     
 
     Income tax benefit per books    
               
      $                               

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company s net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2016 are as
follows:  

The
Company has approximately $43,000 of net operating losses ( NOL ) carried forward to offset taxable income, if any,
in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2034. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance
against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

We have funded our operations to date
primarily through the sale of equity. Based on our current operating plan, we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash
equivalents to fund our operations into the coming months. We will require additional cash to fund our operating plan past that
time. If the level of sales anticipated by our financial plan are not achieved or our working capital requirements are higher than
planned, we will need to raise additional cash sooner or take actions to reduce operating expenses. We are implementing plans to
reduce our costs of capital and improve our revenue. If we cannot generate adequate cash by implementing these steps, we plan to
obtain additional cash through the issuance of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional cash will be
available or that, if available, it will be available on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis. If adequate funds are not available
on a timely basis, we intend to limit our operations to extend our funds as we pursue other financing opportunities and business
relationships. This limitation of operations could include reducing our planned investment in working capital to fund revenue growth
and result in reductions in staff, operating costs, and capital expenditures. 

Net cash used in operations was ($23,399)
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 mainly consisted of a net loss of $18,149 offset by increase in accrued expenses. 

Cash provided by investing activities
totaled $30,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Assets and Liabilities:    

At September 30, 2016, we had total
current assets consisting of cash $7,871 and current liabilities of $0. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of September 30, 2016, we do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Inflation    

Inflation has not had a material impact
on our business and we do not expect inflation to have an impact on our business in the near future

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

This item is not applicable as we are
currently considered a smaller reporting company. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our company's disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end
of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our company's management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated. 

We plan to take steps to enhance and
improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form
10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement
the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, subject to obtaining additional financing: (i) appoint additional
qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon
our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such
funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. 

Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting    

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
