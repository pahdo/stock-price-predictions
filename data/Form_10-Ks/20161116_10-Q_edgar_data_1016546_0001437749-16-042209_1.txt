   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (Expressed in United States Dollars)    
     
   Note     1          Basis of Presentation and Going Concern    
     
   Description of the Company and Business   
     
  Altair Nanotechnologies Inc., (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation that develops, manufactures and sells nano lithium titanate batteries and energy storage systems. The Company s nano lithium titanate battery systems offer higher power density, longer cycle life, rapid charge and discharge capabilities, a wider operating temperature range and higher levels of safety than conventional lithium-ion batteries. The Company targets applications that utilize the key attributes of its technology with product applications mainly found in the electric grid, transportation (commercial vehicles), and industrial market segments.  
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The interim consolidated financial statements of Altair Nanotechnologies Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) are unaudited. These condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary by management to fairly state the Company s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. The 2015 year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). This Form 10-Q (this  Report ) should be read in conjunction with the Company s Comprehensive Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2015, which includes all disclosures required by GAAP.   
     
   Going Concern   
      
  The Company anticipates to continue to have negative cash flows from operations as it ramps up production at their new manufacturing facilities. If the Company is not able to refinance its debt or obtain additional capital, the Company will not be able to pay off its current debt obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The company financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
      
  The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately generate revenues at a level that will result in profitability and positive cash flows from operations. To address these matters, we are taking actions to pay off loans when due, refinance existing loans if needed, obtain capital leases, obtain additional loans collateralized by the land use rights, third party guarantees and other assets, and obtain approval for additional grant incentives from the government of Wu an, China. However, there can be no assurance that additional grant funds to support our capital needs will be available to us and that we will be able to refinance existing loans, obtain additional loans, or raise further funds through other sources such as through an equity offering. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions, be on terms that are not satisfactory to us, or contain covenants on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.  
        
   Principles of Consolidation    
     
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries which include (1) Altair U.S. Holdings, (2) Altairnano, Inc., (3) Altair Nanotechnologies (China) Co., Ltd., and (4) Northern Altair Nanotechnologies Co., Ltd. All of the subsidiaries are either incorporated in the United States of America or China. Inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
   Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Guidance   
     
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (Expressed in United States Dollars)    
     
   Note 2            Restricted Cash    
       
  As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash of $0.23 million and $0.23 million is restricted as performance guarantee for China State Grid Project, respectively.  
     
   Note 3          Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Measurements    
      
  The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and notes payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company s short term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. The Company performs recurring fair-value measurements for its warrant liabilities.  
     
  The fair values and corresponding classifications under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy of outstanding warrants recorded as recurring liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet were recorded using level 3 inputs based on a Monte Carlo option simulation model, which uses prevailing interest rates, Company s stock price volatility and expected warrant term. Based on the valuation model used by the Company, the value of the warrant liability was determined to be $nil for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The change in the fair value of the warrants are recorded in Other (expense) income for each of the periods presented.  
     
                 During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company has entered into several agreements to provide financial guarantees in relation to the EV bus sales (See note 4). The Company engaged a third party valuation expert to determine the fair value of the financial guarantees. Fair value (level 3) of the financial guarantee at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $nil and $0.21 million, respectively.  
      
   NOTE 4   ELECTRIC BUS SALES   
       
    On April 19, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement (the  Agreement") with Wu an Municipal People's Government ("Wu'an") and Handan Municipal People's Government ("Handan") regarding the establishment by Altair China of a manufacturing facility in the City of Wu'an, in Hebei Province in China. The Agreement also contemplates the purchase by Wu'an and Handan of electric buses beginning in late 2012 and continuing over five years, and the future purchase of electric taxis and energy storage systems. No EV buses were sold during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  
     
  In connection with the EV Bus sales to Handan in prior year, the Company agreed to provide to a third-party leasing entity a security deposit equals to 20% of the contract price. The security deposit is refundable over ten-year period when Handan completed its obligations to the third-party leasing entity. The difference between the present value of the refundable security deposit and the gross amount was recorded as current period other expense and unamortized discount to the security deposit (Note 6). The unamortized discount is amortized straight line over the refund period of 10 years.

    In re Altair Nanotechnologies Securities Litigation,    1:14-cv-07828 (S.D.N.Y.) : On September 26, 2014, a shareholder of the Company filed a putative class action against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. An amended complaint was filed on July 21, 2015. The lawsuit alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based upon statements made between May 15, 2013 and September 4, 2014, inclusive, regarding the Company s financial statements and internal controls.  Plaintiff sought unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, as well as interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation. On November 30, 2015, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement, without defendants admitting liability.  Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, in exchange for a release from liability, defendants agreed to pay $1.5 million to be distributed among the putative class members in a manner determined by the Court.  In December 2015, the Company accrued a $0.6 million payable representing the remaining deductible under the applicable insurance policy. The Company paid the accrued liability of $0.6 million on February 23, 2016. The Court approved the settlement and dismissed the action on June 17, 2016.

Altair was named as a nominal defendant. The two cases, which were consolidated on May 15, 2015, allege violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on substantially the same facts underlying the putative securities litigation. As of the balance sheet reporting date, the Company did not have reasonable estimation of settlement amount. In July 2016, certain parties executed a stipulation of settlement, without defendants admitting liability, whereby Altair agreed to adopt certain governance proposals and pay an amount not exceeding $150,000 in plaintiffs  attorneys  fees and expenses. The court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement on August 22, 2016, and has scheduled a settlement hearing for January 9, 2017.  If the settlement receives final approval, this action will be dismissed in its entirety.  Notice of the proposed settlement is available on Altair s website.  A summary notice has also been published online.

   Overview   
     
  We are a Delaware corporation that develops, manufactures and sells nano lithium titanate batteries and energy storage systems. Our nano lithium titanate battery systems offer higher power density, longer cycle life, rapid charge and discharge capabilities, a wider operating temperature range and higher levels of safety than conventional lithium-ion batteries. We target applications that effectively utilize the key attributes of our technology, and these applications can be found primarily in the electric grid, transportation (commercial vehicles), and industrial market segments.  
     
  In April 2012, we formed Altair Nanotechnologies (China) Co., Ltd. ( Altair China ) and Northern Altair Nanotechnologies Co., Ltd. ( Northern Altair ) in order to aggregate key elements of our supply chain and expand into the Chinese market. In January 2014, our Board of Directors approved plans to consolidate all U.S. manufacturing operations and transition manufacturing to Wu an, China. Effective in early 2016, the majority of our principal assets and operations are now located in China.  
     
  In 2013, we transferred the production of our nLTO material to the New Energy Industrial Park in Wu an city, Hebei province, China. We built, installed and further improved the manufacturing of our nLTO. In 2013, a 150 metric ton per year manufacturing line was completed and put into production as our phase one nLTO production line. In the same year, to meet the high demand of Lithium batteries in the China market, we completed the business process of sourcing the equipment to be procured for the phase two nLTO production line, under the joint efforts of the Altair U.S. and Altair China teams. This nLTO line was put into production in fourth quarter of 2015 and has reached an annual production capacity of 2,250 metric tons during 2016, with an expected annual capacity of 3,000 metric tons  . We built a phase three nLTO production line and it was completed and installed in the fourth quarter of 2016 with an annual production capacity of 3,500 metric tons.  
     
  As of January 2016, the module production was transferred from Anderson, Indiana to our manufacturing location in Wu an, China. In the U.S., we are maintaining some of our core R D personnel, who provide technical transfer and services to our China entities in the areas of core R D, engineering operational capabilities and technologies that influence our manufacturing in Wu an, China.   
     
  In 2014, in order to further cut the cost of our products, improve product chain management efficiencies, and effectively serve the large market in China, we built two battery module production lines with an expected total capacity of approximately 6,000 modules per year. In the first quarter of 2016, we transferred the U.S. module production line to China. We are expecting the three battery module production lines to reach an expected total capacity of 9,000 modules per year by the end of 2016.   
     
  We have completed the technology and production validation of our Gen 4 modules with China produced nLTO and China made module parts. The Gen 2 modules is still be available in 2016. Both Gen 2 and Gen 4 products have passed the United Nations ( UN ), International Standards Organization ( ISO ), SAE International ( SAE ) and International Electrochemical Commission ( IEC ) testing and reports are being generated by T V S D ( TUV ). TUV, a German based company, who has a test facility in China and results are generally accepted by the UN and U.S. In December 2015, our battery module production line in the U.S. was discontinued. We were able to maintain a very stable period of time overlapping production while transferring the battery module production from the U.S. to China, without any impact on customer order delivery. Our battery modules have been generally used in EV Buses, trolley buses and hoisting equipment in the Europe and the U.S markets. Our OEM cell producer s capacity can reach 70,000 Altair format cells per year. Sometime in the near future, we expect to validate another OEM cell producer to reduce dependency on one supplier, which will provide competition between suppliers and reduce costs for Altair.   
     
  We plan on building and validating ALTI-ESS (energy storage systems) production capabilities in China and export them to Europe, the U.S. and to other countries of the world.   

20

We now have a battery management system ( BMS ) distribution center in Europe to provide improved efficiency and timely delivery of our supply of the BMS units to our European customers. Our BMS supplier has a production base in China, which we believe will meet the demand of the China market.   
     
  By building manufacturing and assembly facilities in Wu an, China for our nLTO material, battery cells and modules, and soon our energy storage systems, we have centered the whole supply chain in China. In adopting this strategy, we expect to significantly reduce costs, shorten lead times, reduce cash flow pressures, improve the quality and production management efficiency and increase our profit.   
     
   Results of Operations   
     
    The following summarizes our revenue, operating expenses, and net loss for all periods presented below. You should read the following in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, including quarterly information, presented elsewhere in this quarterly report.   

21

The table below sets forth line items from the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated Statement of Operations (in thousands of dollars):   

Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 compared with the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015   
     
   Revenues:  The consolidated revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016 increased by $5.70 million, or 309%, to $7.55 million from $1.85 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the revenues from China operations increased by $6.45 million due to significant increased production sales to related party during the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to same period in 2015. The revenues from U.S. decreased by $0.75 million due to reduced product sales during the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to same period in 2015, since major production and product sales shifted to China.   
     
   Cost of goods sold:  The consolidated costs of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $4.90 million, an increase of $2.79 million or 132% from $2.11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the costs of goods sold increased by $3.52 million in China due to increased product sales and reduced unit cost from increased production level, offset by an decrease of $0.73 million in U.S. operation from decreased product sales during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in prior year.   
     
   Research and development:  The consolidated research and development costs decreased by $0.05 million, or 26%, to $0.16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $0.21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was related mainly to lower salaries and benefits driven by lower headcount mainly at our U.S. facilities.  

22

Sales and marketing:  The consolidated sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.07 million, or 59%, to $0.06 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $0.13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to the U.S. operations which sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.04 million due to lower headcount of the sales team as we shifted our operation focus to China. The sales and marketing expenses of the China operations decreased by $0.03 million which mainly related to lower headcount in China.   
     
   General and administrative:  The consolidated general and administrative expenses increased by $0.51 million, or 21%, to $2.93 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $2.42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the China operations which general and administrative expenses increased by $0.66 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in prior year. The increase was due to higher professional fees related to regulatory filings and increased salaries     by more headcounts and business expansion in China during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.   
     
   Depreciation and amortization:  The consolidated depreciation and amortization decreased by $0.11 million, or 27%, to $0.30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, from $0.41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Lower depreciation and amortization was mainly related to sale and disposal of equipment at our U.S. facilities.  
     
   Gain on disposal of fixed assets:  The consolidated gain on disposal of fixed assets increased by $0.03 million, or 100%, to $0.03 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from nil for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This was primarily due to proceeds received on sale of fixed assets during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as the Company did not have any fixed assets sold in the same period of 2015.  
   
   Interest expense, net:  The consolidated interest expense, net decreased to $0.77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, from $1.04 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.27 million or 26%. The decrease in interest expense was mainly attributable to the China operations which interest expense decreased by $0.24 million because more interest expenses were capitalized regarding the construction period of new fixed assets during the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The interest expense in the U.S. operations also decreased by $0.03 million due to lower debt balances during the three months ended March 31 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year.  
     
   Change in fair value of warrants:  During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded nil and a gain of $6 thousand, respectively, due to the change in the fair value of warrants outstanding that we had previously issued.  
     
   Gain on foreign exchange:  Transaction gains or losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency represented nil and a loss of $1 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   Other income - buses:  Other income - buses amounted to $5 thousand and nil for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This is due to the amortization of financial guaranty premium provided to a third party for the buses sold in prior periods.  
     
   Other expenses - buses:  No bus sales occurred for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.  
     
   Other income:  Other income amounted to $0.16 million and $0.23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. The decrease was mainly related to the derecognition of an accrued liability that resulted in a gain during the three months ended March 31, 2015 that resulted in a gain.  
     
   Net loss:  Net loss decreased by $2.86 million to $1.37 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, from $4.23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in net loss was driven by an increase in gross profit of $2.91 million or 1,114% from increase product sales, and decrease of $0.20 million or 78% in other expenses for the current period versus the same period in the prior year.

At March 31, 2016, we had a working deficit of $52.00 million compared to working deficit of $47.85 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to an increase in current liabilities of $14.39 million attributable mainly to a $14.28 million increase in amount due to related parties.   
     
  A summary of our cash flow activities is as follows (In thousands of dollars):  

Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 as Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2015   
     
  Net cash used by operating activities was $9.18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to a net provide of cash of $8.40 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The change in cash from operations resulted from $6.69 million increase in amount due from related party and $0.90 million change in prepaid expenses and other current assets during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to the collection of other receivable of bus sales in 2015.  
     
  Net cash used in investing was $7.93 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to $1.48 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Cash used in investing activities was driven by our purchases of production equipment and construction of production facilities in China.  
     
  Net cash provided by financing activities was $15.62 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to a net use of cash of $7.09 million for the three months ending March 31, 2015.

  We incurred a net loss of $1.37 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and we had an accumulated deficit of $273.86 million and a negative working capital of $52.00 million as of March 31, 2016. In addition, we have $55.55 million of debt coming due in the next 12 months and the Company anticipates to continue to have negative cash flows from operations as it ramps up production at their new manufacturing facilities. If the Company is not able to refinance its debt or obtain additional capital, the Company will not be able to pay off its current debt obligations. The company financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

24

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately generate revenues at a level that will result in profitability and positive cash flows from operations. To address these matters, we are taking actions to pay off loans when due, refinance existing loans if needed, obtain capital leases, obtain additional loans collateralized by the land use rights, third party guarantees and other assets, and obtain approval for additional grant incentives from the government of Wu an, China. However, there can be no assurance that additional grant funds to support our capital needs will be available to us and that we will be able to refinance existing loans, obtain additional loans, or raise further funds through other sources such as through an equity offering. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions, be on terms that are not satisfactory to us, or contain covenants on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.  
      
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  As of March 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of the SEC s Regulation S-K.  

Capital Commitments - Fixed Assets    
     
  The Company has contractual obligations to suppliers of machine and equipment related to future capital expenditures as of March 31, 2016. The Company's commitment for minimum payment under these contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016 is $1.55 million. In the contract, the Company noted that all of these contractual obligations would be fulfilled in 2016.  
   
    Debt    
     
  As of March 31, 2016, we are required to pay principal amounts of $70.99 million within next year and the remainder of $6.59 million payable in two years.  
     
    Capital Commitment - Production Plant    
     
  As discussed further in Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report, in conjunction with the Land Use Rights obtained by Northern Altair, we agreed to make fixed asset investments on the land of approximately $312.60 million, subject to loan guarantees and other incentives from Wu an, China, over an unspecified period of time up to the 50-year life of the Land Use Rights, with initial construction occurring in 2013.   The remaining commitment as March 31, 2016 is $250.40 million.  
     
    Lease    
   
  The Company leases a 70,000 square feet facility in Flagship Business Accelerator Building located at 3019 Enterprise Drive, Anderson, Indiana under a triple net lease with Flagship Enterprise Center, Inc. The facility was used for the production of prototype batteries and battery systems. The lease amended on January 27, 2015 will expire on June 30, 2017. Any lease renewal options will be negotiated no less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of this lease. Annual rent under this lease is $0.26 million plus IT fees, utilities and maintenance. As such, the Company will incur minimum rent payments of $0.26 million, $0.26 million, and $0.13 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Effective May 1, 2016, the Company agreed to pay $0.14 million as a payment to terminate the lease effective by the end of May 2016.     Use of the facility has been agreed upon until a new tenant is found. The landlord will give the Company thirty-day notice at their discretion to vacate the premises. The Company expects to find new office space for the current employees in the general Anderson, Indiana area at a reduced rate and space requirement by the end of the second quarter of 2017.  
     
    Item 3.             Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    
     
  As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

Item 4.     Controls and Procedure    
     
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures .  Based on an evaluation required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015which is the end of the interim quarter and annual periods covered by this Quarterly Report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d-e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are not effective and there is as of such dates a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures. This material weakness is rooted in the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, as a result of which we were late, and prior to this Quarterly Report, have not filed any required periodic reports since 2013.   

25

Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(d-f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:  

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;    

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;    

provide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and    

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.     
     
  Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.  

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
     
  With respect to previously reported legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations or financial position, there were no material developments during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  
   
    In re Altair Nanotechnologies Securities Litigation,    1:14-cv-07828 (S.D.N.Y.) : On September 26, 2014, a shareholder of the Company filed a putative class action against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. An amended complaint was filed on July 21, 2015. The lawsuit alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based upon statements made between May 15, 2013 and September 4, 2014, inclusive, regarding the Company s financial statements and internal controls.  Plaintiff sought unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, as well as interest, and attorney s fees and costs of litigation. On November 30, 2015, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement, without defendants admitting liability.  Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, in exchange for a release from liability, defendants agreed to pay $1.5 million to be distributed among the putative class members in a manner determined by the Court.  In December 2015, the Company accrued a $0.6 million payable representing the remaining deductible under the applicable insurance policy. The Company paid the accrued liability of $0.6 million on February 23, 2016. The Court approved the settlement and dismissed the action on June 17, 2016.   
     
    In re Altair Nanotechnologies Shareholder Derivative Litigation,    1:14-cv-09418, 1:14-cv-09958 (S.D.N.Y.) : In late 2014, two shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain current and former officers and directors of Altair the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Altair was named as a nominal defendant. The two cases, which were consolidated on May 15, 2015, allege violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on substantially the same facts underlying the putative securities litigation. In July 2016, certain parties executed a stipulation of settlement, without defendants admitting liability, whereby Altair agreed to adopt certain governance proposals and pay an amount not exceeding $150,000 in plaintiffs  attorneys  fees and expenses. The court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement on August 22, 2016, and has scheduled a settlement hearing for January 9, 2017.  If the settlement receives final approval, this action will be dismissed in its entirety.  Notice of the proposed settlement is available on Altair s website.  A summary notice has also been published online.     
     
    In the Matter of Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc.   (LA-4452): In or around January 2015, SEC opened an investigation into the resignation of Crowe Horwath LLP ( Crowe ) as Altair s independent auditor in August 2014.  As part of its investigation, the SEC issued several subpoenas to the Company and its current and former officers relating to Crowe s resignation and a Form 8-K filed by the Company on March 13, 2015.  On May 4, 2016, the SEC sent Altair a Wells Notice identifying possible violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  On August 29, 2016, the Company made an offer of settlement to the SEC whereby it consented to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying the findings therein except as to the SEC s jurisdiction, that the Company:  (i) cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; (ii) make certain filings with the SEC by November 15, 2016 or have the registration of its securities under the Exchange Act revoked; and (iii) pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $250,000 within 10 days of the entry of the order. Such offer of settlement was accepted by the SEC and resulted in a Release No. 78997 dated September 29, 2016 with respect to the same. In August 2016, the Company accrued $250,000 and deposited the funds into escrow which was paid from escrow to the SEC in October 2016.
