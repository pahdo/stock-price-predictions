  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
   
  NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
  Company 
  Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., an Israeli corporation (the "Company" or "Mellanox"), was incorporated and commenced operations in March 1999. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. 
  Principles of presentation 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts as well as those of its wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions. 
  On February 23, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of EZchip Semiconductor, Ltd. ("EZchip"), a public company formed under the laws of the State of Israel and specializing in network-processing semiconductors. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, EZchip became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q include the results of operations of EZchip commencing as of the acquisition date. 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been prepared by the Company without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, the Company believes that the disclosures contained in this quarterly report comply with the requirements of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for a quarterly report on Form 10-Q and are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be anticipated for the entire year ending December 31, 2016 or thereafter. 
  Risks and uncertainties 
  The Company is subject to all of the risks inherent in a company which operates in the dynamic and competitive semiconductor industry. Significant changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations: unpredictable volume or timing of customer orders; ordered product mix; the sales outlook and purchasing patterns of the Company's customers based on consumer demands and general economic conditions; loss of one or more of the Company's customers; decreases in the average selling prices of products or increases in the average cost of finished goods; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components used in the Company's products; reliance on a limited number of subcontractors to manufacture, assemble, package and production test the Company's products; the Company's ability to successfully develop, introduce and sell new or enhanced products in a timely manner; product obsolescence and the Company's ability to manage product transitions; the timing of announcements or introductions of new products by the Company's competitors; and the Company's ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses. 
  Use of estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting periods. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances, investment valuation, warranty reserves, inventory reserves, share-based compensation expense, long-term asset valuations, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuation, hedge effectiveness, deferred income tax asset valuation, uncertain tax positions, litigation and other loss contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments

MELLANOX TECHNOLOGIES, LTD. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) 

about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue, costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results that the Company experiences may differ materially and adversely from the Company's original estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company's future results of operations will be affected. 
  Significant accounting policies 
  There have been no changes in the Company s significant accounting policies that were disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, for a discussion of significant accounting policies and estimates.

Net income per share 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2016 and 2015  : 

The Company excluded   551,647   and   521,015   anti-dilutive employee share-based awards for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   707,305   and   502,419   anti-dilutive employee share-based awards for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, from the computation of diluted net income per share. 
  Recent accounting pronouncements  
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, "FASB", issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The standard clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The standard becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
  In June 2016, the FASB, issued     ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The standard introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. Assumptions, models, and methods used in estimating an allowance for loan and lease losses are required disclosures under the standard. A cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings is recorded in the period of adoption and a prospective transition approach is applied for certain assets. The standard becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020. Early application is permitted beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The standard requires excess tax benefits to be recognized in the statement of operations as an income tax expense and is applied prospectively by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment of excess tax benefits from equity in the period of adoption. The standard establishes an alternative practical expedient for estimating the expected term of an award by recognizing the effects of forfeitures in compensation cost when the forfeitures occur. Adoption of the alternative practical expedient is applied prospectively on an entity-wide basis. The standard requires that amounts paid to a taxing authority on the employee s behalf as a result of directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes are to be presented on a retrospective basis as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. The standard becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . The standard requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability and requires leases to be classified as either an operating or a finance type lease. The standard excludes leases of intangible assets or inventory. Early adoption of the standard is allowed. The standard becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)  . The standard requires entities to carry all investments in equity securities, with certain exceptions, at fair value with adjustment recorded through net income ("FVTNI"). The standard eliminates the requirement of recognizing unrealized gains or losses in other comprehensive income for trading or available-for-sale marketable equity securities. The standard requires the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk, excluding derivative liability instruments, to be reflected in other comprehensive income. The standard requires an evaluation for the need of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to debt securities classified as available-for-sale in combination with the Company's other deferred tax assets. The standard becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and early adoption is allowed. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers by one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The standard becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, but allows the Company to adopt the standard one year earlier if it so chooses. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide a good or service to the customer (i.e., the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (i.e., the entity is an agent). In April, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. In May, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients. The above updates do not change the core principles of the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The amendments have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue recognition standard. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect that the standard and subsequent updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 3 BUSINESS COMBINATION: 
  On   February 23, 2016  , the Company completed its acquisition of   EZchip  . Under the terms of the Agreement of Merger dated as of   September 30, 2015   (as amended on   November 17, 2015  ), by and among the Company, Mondial Europe Sub Ltd. and EZchip (the "Merger Agreement") the total consideration was   $787.0 million   including   $1.0 million   attributable to assumed RSUs. The net cash purchase price of   $698.5 million   consisted of a   $786.0 million   cash payment for all outstanding common shares of EZchip at the price of   $25.50   per share and net of   $87.5 million   cash acquired. The Company also assumed   891,822   EZchip RSUs and converted them to   499,894   equivalent Company RSU awards. The fair value of the converted RSUs was determined based on the per share value of the underlying Mellanox ordinary shares of $  46.40   per share as of the acquisition date. The   499,894   RSUs had a total aggregate value of   $23.2 million  , of which   $1.0 million   was recorded as a component of the purchase price for service rendered prior to the acquisition date and   $22.2 million   will be recognized as share-based compensation expense over the remaining required service period of up to   2.25 years   from the acquisition date.  
  In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a   $280.0 million   variable interest rate Term Debt maturing   February 21, 2019  . For additional information on the Term Debt, see Note 13 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The Company accounted for the transaction using the acquisition method, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The amount of recognized identifiable acquired assets and liabilities assumed are primarily based on provisional fair values and are subject to revision as the Company finalizes its analysis. Final determination of fair values may result in further adjustments to the values presented below. The following summarizes consideration paid for EZchip at the acquisition date: 

The following summarizes the Company's preliminary allocation of the total purchase price, net of cash acquired for the EZchip acquisition after consultation with third party valuation specialists: 

Acquisition-related expenses for the EZchip acquisition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   $0.4 million   and   $7.5 million  , respectively and primarily consisted of investment banking, consulting and other professional fees.

(1)    In-process research and development ("IPR D") will not be amortized until the underlying products reach technological feasibility. Upon completion, each IPR D project will be amortized over its useful life. 

Trade name represents the fair values of brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of EZchip s products and services. The Company used the income approach and utilized a discount rate of   10.0%   to determine the fair value of trade name assets. 
  Customer relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenues that will be derived from the sale of products to existing customers of EZchip. The Company used the comparative method ("with/without") of the income approach to determine the fair value of this intangible asset and utilized a discount rate of   10.0%  .  
  Backlog represents the fair value of sales order backlog as of the valuation date. The Company used the income approach to determine the fair value of this intangible asset and utilized a discount rate of   8.0%  . 
  Developed technology represents completed technology that has passed technological feasibility and/or is currently offered for sale to customers. The Company used the income approach to value the developed technology. Under the income approach, the expected future cash flows from each technology are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. Significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and the return on assets. The Company applied a discount rate of   9.0%   to value the developed technology assets taking into consideration market rates of return on debt and equity capital and the risk associated with achieving forecasted revenues related to these assets.  
  The IPR D intangible asset represents the value assigned to an acquired research and development project that, as of the acquisition date, had not established technological feasibility. The fair value of IPR D was determined using a discount rate of   12.0%  . This intangible asset will be capitalized on the balance sheet and evaluated periodically for impairment until the project is completed, at which time it will be transferred to developed technology and become subject to amortization over its useful life. IPR D consists of   one   project related to the development of two network processors. The project is expected to be completed over the next   two   years. The estimated remaining costs to complete the IPR D project was $  22.3 million   as of the acquisition date, which will be charged to operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, one component of the IPR D project reached technological feasibility and   $4.2 million   was transferred to developed technology and will be amortized over   three   years. 
  Goodwill  
  Goodwill arising from the acquisition represents the value of the skilled assembled workforce and projected growth in overall revenues. The EZchip acquisition is a step in the Company's strategy to become a leading broad-line supplier of intelligent interconnect solutions for data centers. The addition of EZchip s products and expertise in network processing is expected to enhance the Company's leadership position, and ability to deliver complete end-to-end, intelligent 10, 25, 40, 50, and 100Gb/s interconnect and processing solutions for advanced data center and edge platforms. The combined company will have diverse and robust solutions to enable customers to meet the growing demands of data-intensive applications used in high-performance computing, Web 2.0, cloud, secure data center, enterprise, telecom, database, financial services, and storage environments. These significant factors were the basis for the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is not expected to be  
  
   13 

MELLANOX TECHNOLOGIES, LTD. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) 

deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present.  
  Supplemental pro forma data 
  The following unaudited pro forma data have been prepared as if the EZchip acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015, and includes adjustments for amortization of intangible assets acquired, the effect of purchase accounting adjustments including the step-up of inventory, share-based compensation expense, and interest on the Term Debt incurred to partially finance the acquisition. Pro forma results are not indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2015 or of results that may occur in the future.   

  Material non-recurring adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the effect of purchase accounting adjustments include acquisition-related costs of   $14.5 million  , composed of acquisition cost of   $7.5 million   incurred by the Company and $  7.0   million incurred by EZchip, the stock-based compensation expense related to accelerated RSUs from the acquisition of $  4.8   million and the effects related to the step-up of inventory of   $8.3   million.  
  The Company immediately integrated EZchip into its ongoing operations. As a result, it is impracticable to determine EZchip's effect on revenue and earnings in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the reporting period.

  The Company measures its cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The Company s cash equivalents are classified within Level 1. Cash equivalents are valued primarily using quoted market prices utilizing market observable inputs. The Company's investments in debt securities and certificates of deposits are classified within Level 2 as the market inputs to value these instruments consist of market yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. In addition, foreign currency contracts are classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. The Level 3 valuation inputs include the Company's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument's valuation. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any assets or liabilities valued based on Level 3 valuations. 
  Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis: 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining principal of $  253.0 million   on the Company's   $280.0 million   Term Debt is classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy. The Company calculated a fair value amount of   $252.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   based on a discounted cash flow model using observable market inputs and taking into consideration variables such as interest rate changes, comparable instruments, and long-term credit ratings.

  Other Commitments 
  Operating lease  
  On May 3, 2016, the Company entered into a lease agreement for additional office space expected to be built in Yokneam, Israel. The lease term expires   10 years   after lease inception with no options to extend the lease term. The Company's occupancy of the additional office space and its obligation under the lease agreement is contingent on the lessor's attainment of stated milestones in the lease agreement. As such, the Company cannot make a reliable estimate as to the timing of cash payments under the lease. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated total future lease obligation is approximately   $29.4 million  . Over a twelve month period an estimated rental expense is approximately   $2.9 million  , and if recognized, would increase the Company's operating expenses in its consolidated statement of operations.

Royalty-bearing grants 
  We are obliged to pay royalties to the Office of the Israeli National Authority for Technological Innovation or the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Economy and Industry of Israel (formerly, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor) (the "OCS") for research and development efforts partially funded through grants from the OCS and under approved plans in accordance with the Israeli Law for Encouragement of Research and Development in the Industry, 1984, (the "R D Law").  Royalties on the revenues derived from sales of the Company's products incorporating OCS funded know-how are payable to the Israeli government at the rate up to   4.5%   of the amount of the received grants. The Company's obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on actual sales of the products, at which time a liability is recorded. In the absence of such sales, we cannot make a reliable estimate as to the timing of cash settlement of the royalties. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimated a total future royalty obligation of approximately   $25.0 million  , and if recognized, would increase the Company's cost of revenues in its consolidated statement of operations. 
  Unrecognized tax benefits 
  Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, it is unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with respective taxing authorities. As of   September 30,     2016  , the Company's unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $37.9 million  , which would reduce the Company's income tax expense and effective tax rate, if recognized.

NOTE 11 INCOME TAXES: 
  As of   September 30,     2016   and December 31,   2015  , the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of   $37.9 million   and   $25.4 million  , respectively. It is the Company s policy to classify accrued interest and penalties as part of the unrecognized tax benefits and record the expense in the provision for income taxes. The amount of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $  1.8 million   at   September 30,     2016   and   $1.2 million   at December 31,   2015  .  
  On January 4, 2016 the Israeli Government legislated a reduction in corporate income tax rates from   26.5%   to   25.0%  , effective in 2016. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 were measured using the   26.5%   tax rate. In 2016, the Company measured deferred tax assets and liabilities using the   25.0%   tax rate. The immediate change in the corporate income tax rates from   26.5%   to   25.0%   resulted in a reduction of $  1.3 million   to the Company's deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase in the Company's income tax expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30,     2016  , the   2013   through   2015   tax years are open and may be subject to potential examinations in the United States. The Company has net operating losses in the United States from prior tax periods beginning in   2002   which may be subject to examination upon utilization in future tax periods. As of   September 30,     2016  , the   2011   through   2015   tax years are open and may be subject to potential examinations in Israel. As of   September 30,     2016  , the income tax returns of the Company and   one   of its subsidiaries in Israel are under examination by the Israeli Tax Authority for certain years from   2011   to   2014  . As of September 30, 2016, the   2011   through   2015   tax years are open and may be subject to potential examinations in Denmark. 
  The Beneficiary Enterprise and Approved Enterprise tax holiday associated with the Company's Yokneam and Tel Aviv operations began in   2011  . The tax holiday for the Company's Yokneam operations will expire in   2021   and the tax holiday for the Company's Tel Aviv operation will expire between the years   2017   and   2021  . The tax holiday has resulted in a cash tax savings of $  32.0 million   and   $20.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, increasing diluted earnings per share by approximately   $0.65   and $  0.43   in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company s effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of its worldwide earnings or losses, tax regulations and tax holiday benefits in Israel, and the effectiveness of the Company s tax planning strategies. The Company s effective tax rates were   6.8%   and   5.3%   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company s effective tax rates were   25.6%   and   8.1%   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The difference between the Company s effective tax rate and the   35%   federal statutory rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulted primarily from the tax holiday in Israel, reversal of unrecognized tax positions due to statutes of limitations and foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rates, partially offset by the accrual of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions, non-tax-deductible expenses such as share-based compensation, losses generated from subsidiaries without tax benefit and the reduction of deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in the Israeli corporate income tax as discussed above.

The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous, and the Company is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax exposures. In addition, interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are subject to change over time. Any changes in the Company s subjective assumptions and judgments could materially affect amounts recognized in its consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. 
  The Company has maintained a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of certain subsidiaries. The Company assesses its ability to recover its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company considers available positive and negative evidence including its recent cumulative losses, its ability to carry-back losses against prior taxable income and its projected financial results. The Company also considers, commensurate with its objective verifiability, the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance may be recorded in the event it is deemed to be more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset cannot be realized. Previously established valuation allowances may also be released in the event it is deemed to be more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset can be realized. Any release of valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit which will positively impact the Company s operating results. Management has determined on the basis of the quarterly assessment performed at   September 30, 2016  , that these deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not to be realized.

At   September 30, 2016  , future scheduled principal payments on the Company's Term Debt is summarized as follows: 

The Term Debt was issued with   $5.5   million in debt issuance costs and bears interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at the Company s option, either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the administrative agent s prime rate, (ii) one-half of 1.00% in excess of the overnight U.S. Federal Funds rate, and (iii)   1.00%   in excess of the   one-month Eurodollar rate  ), plus in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Eurodollar rate loans ranges, based on the applicable total net leverage ratio, from   1.25%   to   2.00%   per annum and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges, based on the applicable total net leverage ratio, from   0.25%   to   1.00%   per annum. 
  The Company s obligations under the Term Debt are guaranteed by all of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain agreed upon exceptions.

  The Term Debt contains a number of covenants and restrictions that among other things, and subject to certain agreed upon exceptions, require the Company and its subsidiaries to satisfy certain financial covenants and restricts the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales, declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt and amend or otherwise alter debt agreements, in each case, subject to certain agreed upon exceptions. A failure to comply with these covenants could permit the lenders under the Term Debt to declare all amounts borrowed under the Term Debt, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the covenants for the Term Debt.

EZchip Acquisition 
  On   February 23, 2016  , we completed our acquisition of   EZchip  , a public company formed under the laws of the State of Israel, at which time EZchip became our wholly owned subsidiary. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement the net cash purchase price of   $698.5 million   consisted of a   $786.0 million   cash payment for all outstanding common shares of EZchip at the price of   $25.50   per share, net of   $87.5 million   cash received. We also assumed   891,822   EZchip RSUs and converted them to   499,894   equivalent Mellanox RSU awards. The fair value of the converted RSUs was determined based on the per share value of the underlying Mellanox ordinary shares of   $46.40   per share as of the acquisition date. The   499,894   RSUs had a total aggregate value of   $23.2 million  , of which   $1.0 million   was recorded as a component of the purchase price for service rendered prior to the acquisition date and   $22.2 million   will be recognized as share-based compensation expense over the remaining required service period of up to   2.25 years   from the acquisition date. 
  In connection with the acquisition, we entered into a   $280.0 million   variable interest rate Term Debt maturing   February 21, 2019  . At   September 30,     2016  , the principal and carrying value of the Term Debt was   $253.0 million   and   $248.9 million  , respectively. 
  We accounted for the transaction using the acquisition method, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The amount of recognized identifiable acquired assets and liabilities assumed are primarily based on provisional fair values and are subject to revision as we finalize our analysis. Final determination of values may result in further adjustments to the values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities.  
  Acquisition-related expenses for the EZchip acquisition for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were $  0.4 million   and   $7.5 million  , respectively, and consisted primarily of investment banking, consulting, employee-related and other professional fees.  
  Amortization of Intangible Assets from Acquisitions 
  Intangible assets from acquisitions subject to amortization are comprised of trade names, customer relationships, backlog, and developed technology. In connection with the EZchip acquisition, we recognized $254.5 million of finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization over their useful lives of 1 to 9 years. Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired intangible assets, was   $17.1 million   and   $2.6 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets was   $44.8 million   and   $7.5 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increased amortization is primarily associated with the EZchip acquisition. For additional information about intangible assets from acquisitions, see Note 6 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Patent Settlement 
  On March 7, 2016, we entered into a settlement and patent license agreement that resolved all litigation matters between Avago, IPtronics, Inc., IPtronics A/S (now Mellanox Technologies Denmark Aps) and Mellanox. Under the settlement, we agreed with Avago not to sue each other for a period of   5 years  . The settlement was deemed not contributory to our operations or products sold. As a result, we recorded a settlement expense in our operating expenses in the amount of   $5.1 million   in our first quarter ended March 31, 2016.  
  Our Business 
  Revenues.   We derive revenues from sales of our ICs, boards, switch systems, cables, modules, software, accessories and other product groups. Revenues for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   were   $224.2 million   compared to   $171.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $52.8 million  , or approximately   31%  . Revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   were   $635.8 million   compared to   $481.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . Our revenues for the three months and   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   are not necessarily indicative of our future results. In order to increase our annual revenues, we must continue to achieve design wins over other InfiniBand and Ethernet providers and providers of competing interconnect technologies. We consider a design win to occur when an original equipment manufacturer ("OEM"), or contract manufacturer notifies us that it has selected our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development. Because the life cycles for our customers' products can last for several years if these products have successful commercial introductions, we expect to continue to generate revenues over an extended period of time for each successful design win. 
  Our products have broad adoption with multiple end customers across HPC, Web 2.0, cloud, enterprise data center, financial services and storage markets. These markets are mainly served by leading server, storage and communications infrastructure OEMs. Therefore, we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of OEM customers. Sales to our top ten customers represented   55%   and   58%   of our total revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016 and 2015  , respectively. Sales to customers representing 10% or more of revenues accounted for   16%   and   14%   of our total revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016 and 2015  , respectively. The loss of one or more of our principal customers, the reduction or  
  
   29 

deferral of purchases, or changes in the mix of our products ordered by any one of these customers could cause our revenues to decline materially if we are unable to increase our revenues from other customers. Our customers, including our most significant customers, are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our products and may cancel orders with limited potential penalties. If any of our large customers reduces or cancels its purchases from us for any reason, it could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. 
  Cost of revenues and gross profit.   The cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of silicon wafers purchased from our foundry supplier, costs associated with the assembly, packaging and production testing of our ICs, outside processing costs associated with the manufacture of our products, royalties due to third parties, warranty costs, excess and obsolete inventory costs, depreciation and amortization, and costs of personnel associated with production management, quality assurance and services. In addition, after we purchase wafers from our foundry suppliers, we also face yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into semiconductor devices. Manufacturing yield is the percentage of acceptable product resulting from the manufacturing process, as identified when the product is tested as a finished IC. If our manufacturing yields decrease, our cost per unit increases, which could have a significant adverse impact on our cost of revenues. We do not have long-term pricing agreements with foundry suppliers and contract manufacturers. Accordingly, our costs are subject to price fluctuations based on the overall cyclical demand for semiconductors. 
  We purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders. We estimate that lead times for delivery of our finished semiconductors from our foundry supplier and assembly, packaging and production testing subcontractor are approximately three to four months, lead times for delivery from our adapter card manufacturing subcontractor are approximately eight to ten weeks, and lead times for delivery from our switch systems manufacturing subcontractors are approximately twelve weeks. We build inventory based on forecasts of customer orders rather than the actual orders themselves. 
  We expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of sales to increase in the future as a result of a reduction in the average sale price of our products and a lower percentage of revenue deriving from sales of ICs and boards, which generally yield higher gross margins than sales of switches and cables. This trend will depend on overall customer demand for our products, our product mix, competitive product offerings and related pricing and our ability to reduce manufacturing costs. 
  Operational expenses 
  Research and development expenses.   Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, share-based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in research and development, costs associated with computer aided design software tools, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, allocable facilities related and administrative expenses and tape-out costs. Tape-out costs are expenses related to the manufacture of new ICs, including charges for mask sets, prototype wafers, mask set revisions and testing incurred before releasing new ICs into production. We anticipate research and development expenses will increase in future periods based on an increase in personnel to support our product development activities and the introduction of new products. 
  Sales and Marketing Expenses.   Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in sales, marketing and customer support, commission payments to third party sales representatives, advertising, trade shows and promotions, travel, amortization of intangibles, and allocable facilities related and administrative expenses. We expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in sales and marketing personnel and increased marketing activities. 
  General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, share-based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in finance, legal, human resources and administrative activities, professional service expenses for accounting, corporate legal fees and allocable facilities related expenses. We expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in personnel and professional services required to support our business activities. 
  Taxes on Income 
  Our operations in Israel have been granted "Approved Enterprise" status by the Investment Center of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry (formerly, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor) and "Beneficiary Enterprise" status by the Israeli Income Tax Authority, which makes us eligible for tax benefits under the Israeli Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959. Under the terms of the Beneficiary Enterprise program, income that is attributable to our operations in Yokneam, Israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of ten years commencing fiscal year 2011. Income that is attributable to our operations in Tel Aviv, Israel is subject to a reduced income tax rate (generally between 10% and the current corporate tax rate, depending on the percentage of foreign investment in the Company) for five to eight years beginning fiscal year 2013. The tax holiday for our Yokneam operations will expire in 2021 and the tax holiday for our Tel-Aviv operations will expire between the years 2017 and 2021. The corporate tax rate was reduced from 26.5% in 2015 to 25% in 2016. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 were measured using the 26.5% tax rate. In 2016, we measured deferred tax assets and liabilities using the 25% tax rate. The immediate change in the  
  
   30 

corporate income tax rates from 26.5% to 25% resulted in a reduction of $1.3 million to our deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase in income tax expense in our first quarter ended March 31, 2016 and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  To prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances, investment valuation, warranty reserves, inventory reserves, share-based compensation expense, long-term asset valuations, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuation, hedge effectiveness, deferred income tax asset valuation, uncertain tax positions, litigation and other loss contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, please see note 1, "The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," in the accompanying notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, for a discussion of additional critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to what was disclosed in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Results of Operations 
   The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:

Comparison of the   Three Months Ended September 30,     2016   to the   Three Months Ended September 30,     2015    
  The following tables represent our total revenues for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   by product type and interconnect protocol: 

Revenues.   Revenues were   $224.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $171.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $52.8 million  , or approximately   31%  . The year-over-year revenue increase in 2016 from 2015 was primarily attributable to increased demand for our Ethernet adapters and incremental revenues from the EZchip acquisition derived primarily from sales of ICs. Our InfiniBand customers continued transitioning from FDR products to the EDR product generation. The 2016 revenues are not necessarily indicative of future results. 
  Gross Profit and Margin.   Gross profit was   $146.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $122.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $23.8 million  , or approximately   19%  . Gross margin declined to   65.1%   in the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   from approximately   71.3%   in the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  . The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in intangible asset amortization costs of   $11.4 million   and an increase in inventory step-up amortization costs of   $0.7 million  , both related to the EZchip acquisition. Gross margin for 2016 is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
  Research and Development. 
  The following table presents details of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated: 

Research and development expenses were   $83.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $65.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $17.7 million  , or approximately   27%  . The increase in salaries and benefits expenses was primarily attributable to headcount additions, including those associated with the  
  
   32 

EZchip acquisition, merit increases and higher accrued bonuses under our annual discretionary bonus award program. The increase in other expenses reflects higher depreciation expense, amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets, and facilities costs. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to devote more resources to develop new products, meet the changing requirements of our customers, expand into new markets and technologies and hire additional personnel. 
  For a further discussion of share-based compensation included in research and development expense, see  Share-based Compensation Expense  below. 
  Sales and Marketing. 
  The following table presents details of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods indicated: 

Sales and marketing expenses were   $34.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $24.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $9.6 million  , or approximately   39%  . The increase in salaries and benefits expenses was primarily related to headcount additions, including those associated with the EZchip acquisition, and merit increases. The increase in trade show and promotions was due primarily to higher trade show exhibit costs. The increase in other expenses primarily reflects higher depreciation expense, amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets associated with the EZchip acquisition and facilities costs. 
  For a further discussion of share-based compensation included in sales and marketing expense, see  Share-based Compensation Expense  below. 
  General and Administrative. 
  The following table presents details of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated: 

General and administrative expenses were   $13.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $10.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $2.6 million  , or approximately   23%  . The increase in salaries and benefits expenses was primarily related to headcount additions, including those associated with the EZchip acquisition, merit increases, and higher accrued bonuses under our annual discretionary bonus awards program. The increase in professional services expenses was primarily related to human resources services, consulting and outsourcing fees. The increase in other expenses was primarily related to higher facilities costs. 
  For further discussion of share-based compensation included in general and administrative expense, see  Share-based Compensation Expense  below.

Share-based Compensation Expense. 
  The following table presents details of our share-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income: 

Share-based compensation expenses were   $17.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30,     2016  , compared to   $12.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   37%  . The increase was primarily attributable to RSUs granted to existing employees during 2016 as part of our annual review process, RSUs assumed and granted to employees in conjunction with the acquisition of EZchip, and RSUs granted to new hires.  
  At   September 30,     2016   there was   $136.5 million   of total unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements. The weighted-average period over which the unearned share-based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately   2.8   years. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense. Future share-based compensation expense and unearned share-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions. 
  Other income (loss), net.   Other income (loss), net in the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   was a loss of   $1.6 million   as compared to income of   $0.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,   2015. The change was primarily attributable to   $2.2 million   of interest expense associated with the Term Debt and a reduction of   $0.3 million   in net foreign exchange losses.  
  Provision for Taxes on Income.   Our provision for taxes on income was   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   as compared to   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  . 
  Our effective tax rate was   6.8%   and   5.3%   for   three months ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   three months ended     September 30,     2016  , the difference between the   6.8%   effective tax rate and the 35% federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the tax holiday in Israel, reversal of unrecognized tax positions due to statutes of limitations and foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rates, partially offset by the accrual of unrecognized tax positions, interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions, non-tax-deductible expenses such as share-based compensation expense, and losses generated from subsidiaries without tax benefits. 
  We assess our ability to recover our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider available positive and negative evidence including our recent cumulative losses, our ability to carry-back losses against prior taxable income and our projected financial results. We also consider, commensurate with objective verifiability, the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance may be recorded in the event it is deemed to be more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset cannot be realized. Previously established valuation allowances may also be released in the event it is deemed to be more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset can be realized. Any release of valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit which will positively impact our operating results.

Comparison of the   Nine Months Ended     September 30,     2016   to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30,     2015    
  The following tables represent our total revenues for the nine months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   by product type and interconnect protocol: 

Revenues.   Revenues were   $635.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $481.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $154.6 million  , or approximately   32%  . The year-over-year revenue increase in 2016 from 2015 was primarily attributable to increased demand for our Ethernet adapters and incremental revenues from the EZchip acquisition derived from sales of ICs. Revenues from our InfiniBand products also increased primarily due to increased sales into HPC and cloud markets. Revenues from InfiniBand EDR products increased as customers continued transitioning from FDR and lower data rate products to the EDR product generation. The increase in other product revenues was primarily due to higher revenue from support. The 2016 revenues are not necessarily indicative of future results. 
  Gross Profit and Margin.   Gross profit was   $407.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $343.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $63.5 million  , or approximately   18%  . Gross margin decreased to   64.1%   in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   from approximately   71.4%   in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in intangible asset amortization costs of   $31.9 million   and inventory step-up amortization costs of   $8.3 million  , both related to the EZchip acquisition. Gross margin for 2016 is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
  Research and Development. 
  The following table presents details of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated: 

Research and development expenses were   $237.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $186.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $50.4 million  , or approximately   27%  . The increase  
  
   35 

in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to headcount additions, including those associated with the EZchip acquisition, merit increases, and higher accrued bonuses under our annual discretionary bonus award program. The increase in development and tape-out costs was attributable to higher material costs as a result of our development activities. The increase in other expenses reflects higher professional service expenses, depreciation expense, amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets, and facilities costs. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to devote more resources to develop new products, meet the changing requirements of our customers, expand into new markets and technologies and hire additional personnel. 
  For a further discussion of share-based compensation included in research and development expense, see  Share-based Compensation Expense  below. 
  Sales and Marketing. 
  The following table presents details of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods indicated: 

Sales and marketing expenses were   $98.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $70.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $27.5 million  , or approximately   39%  . The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to headcount additions, including those associated with the EZchip acquisition, and merit increases. The increase in trade shows and promotions was due primarily to higher trade show exhibit costs and related travel costs. The increase in other expenses primarily reflects higher depreciation expense, amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets associated with the EZchip acquisition and facilities costs. 
  For a further discussion of share-based compensation included in sales and marketing expense, see  Share-based Compensation Expense  below. 
  General and Administrative. 
  The following table presents details of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated: 

General and administrative expenses were   $54.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   compared to   $31.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   $23.6 million  , or approximately   75%  . The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to headcount additions, including those associated with the EZchip acquisition, merit increases and higher accrued bonuses under our annual discretionary bonus award program. The increase in professional services expenses was related to investment banking costs, consulting expenses and other professional fees related to the EZchip acquisition, litigation settlement costs and legal fees. The increase in other expenses was primarily related to higher depreciation and facilities costs. 
  For further discussion of share-based compensation included in general and administrative expense, see  Share-based Compensation Expense  below.

Share-based Compensation Expense. 
  The following table presents details of our share-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income: 

Share-based compensation expenses were   $53.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $37.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , representing an increase of   43%  . The increase was primarily attributable to RSUs granted to existing employees during 2016 as part of our annual review process, RSUs assumed and granted to employees in conjunction with the acquisition of EZchip, RSUs granted to new hires, and expenses related to the acceleration of EZchip RSUs for employees terminated on the closing date.  
  Other income (loss), net.   Other income (loss), net in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   was a loss of   $4.4 million   as compared to a loss of   $1.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,   2015. The change was primarily attributable to   $5.4 million   in interest expense associated with the Term Debt and a   $0.9 million   decrease in interest income and net losses on sale of investments, partially offset by a   $3.2 million   impairment loss on an equity investment in a privately held company in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . 
  Provision for Taxes on Income.   Our provision for taxes on income was   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   as compared to   $4.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . 
  On January 4, 2016 the Israeli Government legislated a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from   26.5%   to   25%  , effective in 2016. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 were measured using the   26.5%   tax rate. In 2016, we measured deferred tax assets and liabilities using the   25%   tax rate. In the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a change in the corporate income tax rates from   26.5%   to   25%   which resulted in a reduction of $  1.3 million   to our deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase in our income tax expense.  
  Our effective tax rate was   25.6%   and   8.1%   for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016  , the difference between the   25.6%   effective tax rate and the 35% federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the tax holiday in Israel, reversal of unrecognized tax positions due to statutes of limitations and foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rates, partially offset by the accrual of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions, non-tax-deductible expenses such as share-based compensation, losses generated from subsidiaries without tax benefit and the reduction of deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in the Israeli corporate income tax as discussed above. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30,     2016  , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of   $55.5 million   and short-term investments of   $236.9 million  . In our first quarter ended March 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of EZchip and acquired its cash of approximately   $87.5 million   and short term investments of   $108.9 million  . We financed the acquisition and related transaction expenses with cash on hand and with $280.0 million from a variable-interest rate three-year Term Debt. At   September 30, 2016  , the total amount of future payments related to the Term Debt was estimated at   $265.6 million  . After taking into consideration expected increases in operating expenses and increases in capital expenditures to support our infrastructure and growth, we expect our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operating and financing activities will be sufficient to fund our operations and both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements arising from the Term Debt. 
  We are an Israeli company and as of   September 30,     2016   our subsidiaries outside of Israel held approximately   $16.5 million   in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
  
   37 

Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and working capital balances at   September 30,     2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was   2.8  :1 at   September 30,     2016   and   4.9  :1 at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by our operating activities amounted to   $142.1 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016  . Net cash provided by our operating activities was attributable to net income of   $9.5 million   adjusted by net non-cash items of   $127.3 million   and changes in assets and liabilities of   $5.3 million   (excluding the changes to assets and liabilities as a result of the EZchip acquisition). Non-cash expenses consisted primarily of   $73.3 million   of depreciation and amortization,   $53.9 million   of share-based compensation, and   $1.3 million   of deferred income taxes. The   $5.3 million   cash inflow from changes in assets and liabilities, excluding the changes to the assets and liabilities as a result of the EZchip acquisition, is attributed to an increase of   $15.1 million   in accrued liabilities and other liabilities primarily related to deferred revenue, a decrease in inventory of   $12.6 million  , a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of   $5.3 million   and an increase in accounts payable of   $4.9 million   due to timing of payments. These were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of   $32.7 million  , primarily due to higher revenues and the timing of revenues within the quarter. 
  Net cash provided by our operating activities amounted to   $115.8 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to net income of   $49.7 million   adjusted by net non-cash items of   $69.4 million   and changes in assets and liabilities of   $3.3 million  . The non-cash items consisted primarily of $37.8 million of share-based compensation, $30.5 million of depreciation and amortization, and $3.2 million of loss on impairment of an equity investment in a private company, partially offset by gains on investments of $2.2 million. The $3.3 million cash decrease from changes in assets and liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in inventories of $24.0 million as a result of our effort to fulfill forecasted sales and in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.5 million, which were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $2.1 million primarily due to the timing of payments, and an increase of $18.8 million in accrued and other liabilities primarily due to increased deferred revenue.  
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $618.5 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016  . Cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to   $698.5 million   of net cash used to acquire EZchip and   $32.7 million   for purchases of property and equipment. These uses were partially offset by net proceeds from sales, maturities and purchases of short-term investments of   $121.0 million  . 
  Net cash used by investing activities was   $42.8 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used by investing activities was primarily attributable to net purchases of short-term investments of   $8.6 million  , the release of restricted cash of   $3.6 million  , purchases of property and equipment of   $37.0 million  , and   $0.6 million   purchases of severance-related insurance policies. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $268.6 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016  . Cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to   $280.0 million   of proceeds from the Term Debt and   $21.6 million   in proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares through our employee equity incentive plans. These were offset by   $27.0 million   of principal payments on the Term Debt,   $5.5 million   of debt issuance costs and   $0.5 million   of principal payments on capital lease obligations. 
  Our financing activities generated   $16.1 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds of   $17.0 million   from issuance of ordinary shares through our employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations of   $0.8 million  . 
  
   38 

Contractual Obligations 
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at   September 30,     2016   and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: 

Purchase commitments.   Purchase commitments are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase orders for inventory are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our subcontractors within an eight to twelve week period. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.  
  Term Debt including interest.   Term Debt commitment represents principal and interest payable. For additional information about the Term Debt, see note 13 "Term Debt" in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  .  
  Other Commitments 
  We also have contingent commitments primarily related to a facility lease agreement based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and royalty payment contingencies based on revenue we may generate from the sales of certain products, the know-how of which was funded by Israeli government grants. For additional information about other commitments, see note 8 "Commitments and Contingencies" in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  .  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  See note 1, "The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent accounting pronouncements" in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting standards, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30,     2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Interest rate fluctuation risk 
  Investments.   Our investments include cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, money market funds and interest bearing investments in government debt securities, commercial paper and corporate bonds with an average remaining maturity of up to 12 months. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and ensure liquidity while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. By policy, we limit the amount of our credit exposure through diversification and restricting our investments to highly rated securities. At the time of purchase, our investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and type of security, except U.S. Treasury or agency securities. Highly rated long-term securities are defined as having a minimum Moody's, Standard   Poor's or Fitch rating of A2 or A, respectively. Highly rated short-term securities are defined as having a minimum Moody's, Standard   Poor's or Fitch rating of P-1, A-1 or F-1, respectively. We have not experienced any significant losses on our cash equivalents or short-term investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 1% change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
  Term Debt.   At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $253.0 million   in principal of variable-interest rate Term Debt outstanding. The impact to our interest expense and pre-tax earnings over the next twelve months, based on hypothetical increases or decreases in LIBOR is as follows: 

The modeling technique used above measures the change in interest expense arising from selected potential changes in LIBOR. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of minus 25 basis points, plus 50 basis points, plus 100 basis points, and plus 150 basis points, which are representative of potential movements in the U.S. Federal Funds rate and the Euro Dollar Rate.  
  Foreign currency exchange risk  
  We derive all of our revenues in U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency in all of our foreign locations. However, a significant portion of our headcount related expenses, consisting principally of salaries and related personnel and facilities expenses, are denominated in new Israeli shekels ("NIS"). This foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar against the NIS. Furthermore, we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in NIS. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against the NIS, we will experience a negative impact on our net income. 
  To protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we have established a balance sheet and anticipated transaction risk management program. Currency derivative instruments and natural hedges are generally utilized in this hedging program. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our hedging program reduces, but does not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements. If we were to experience a strengthening of USD against NIS of 10%, the impact on assets and liabilities denominated in NIS, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would result in a loss before taxes of approximately $0.2 million at   September 30, 2016  . There would also be an impact on the unhedged portion of the future operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had derivative contracts in place of approximately 341.7 million NIS, or approximately   $89.5 million   based upon the exchange rate on that day. The derivative contracts cover a significant portion of future NIS denominated operating expenses expected to occur over the next twelve months. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across a number of major financial institutions. However, under current market conditions, failure of one or more of these financial institutions is possible and could result in incurred losses. 
  
   40 

Inflation related risk 
  We believe that the rate of inflation in both Israel and the United States has not had a material impact on our business to date. Our cost in Israel in U.S. dollar terms will increase if inflation in Israel exceeds the devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in Israel. 
   
  ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO (principal executive officer) and CFO (principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
  As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide the reasonable assurance described above. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  
   41 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  See note 8, "Commitments and Contingencies Legal proceedings" in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, for a full description of legal proceedings and related contingencies and their effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We may, from time to time, become a party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We may also be indirectly affected by administrative or court proceedings or actions in which we are not involved, but which have general applicability to the semiconductor industry. 
   
  ITEM 1A   RISK FACTORS 
  The following risk factors, in addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the other information set forth in this report and our other filings with the SEC, could harm our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as decrease the price of our ordinary shares. We caution the reader that these risk factors, in addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Our management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can they assess the extent to which any of the risk factors or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. 
  Risks Related to Our Business  
  We depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of any one of these customers will adversely affect our revenues.  
  A small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , sales to Hewlett-Packard accounted for   17%   of our total revenues, while sales to our top ten customers accounted for   55%   of our revenues. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, sales to Hewlett-Packard accounted for   14%   of our total revenues, while sales to our top 10 customers accounted for   58%   of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to Hewlett-Packard accounted for 14% of our total revenues, while sales to our top ten customers accounted for 57% of our revenues. Because the majority of servers, storage, communications, infrastructure equipment and embedded systems are sold by a relatively small number of vendors, we expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of customers to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our customers, including our most significant customers, are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our products and may cancel orders with limited potential penalties. If any of our large customers reduces or cancels its purchases from us for any reason, it could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.  
  We are susceptible to additional risks from our international operations.  
  We derived 49% and 45% of our revenues in the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, from sales outside North America. As a result, we face additional risks from doing business internationally, including:  
             
    reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;  
                
    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  
                
    longer sales and payment cycles;  
                
    greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;  
                
    adverse economic conditions;  
                
    seasonal reductions in business activity;  
                
    potentially adverse tax consequences;  
                
    laws and business practices favoring local competition;  
                
    costs and difficulties of customizing products for foreign countries;  
                
    compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties;  
                
    compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;  
     
   42 

compliance with export control and regulations;  
                
    licenses, tariffs, other trade barriers, transit restrictions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;  
                
    restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments;  
                
    foreign currency exchange risks;  
                
    fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions;  
                
    political and economic instability;  
                
    variance and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations; 
                
    natural disasters and public health emergencies; and 
                
    trade and travel restrictions. 
     A significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with various and differing anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws in China. In addition, the anti-corruption laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conflict with each other. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and other policies prohibit us and our employees from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and from engaging in unethical business practices, including kick-backs to or from purely private parties. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of such laws and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures. Any violations of these anti-corruption or trade control laws, or even allegations of such violations, can lead to an investigation, which could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, and lead to significant costs and expenses, including legal fees. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these laws and regulations, we could suffer severe fines and penalties, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our reputation, sales activities or stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or trade control laws and regulations. 
  Our principal research and development facilities are located in Israel, and our directors, executive officers and other key employees are located primarily in Israel and the United States. In addition, we engage sales representatives in various countries throughout the world to market and sell our products in those countries and surrounding regions. If we encounter any of the above risks in our international operations, we could experience slower than expected revenue growth and our business could be harmed.  
  The results of the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. 
  In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our ordinary shares. 
  The government tax benefits that we currently receive require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs. 
  Some of our operations in Israel have been granted "Approved Enterprise" and "Beneficiary Enterprise" status by the Investment Center in the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry (formerly the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor) and the Israeli Income Tax Authority, which makes us eligible for tax benefits under the Israeli Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959. The availability of these tax benefits is subject to certain requirements, including, among other things, making specified investments in fixed assets and equipment, financing a percentage of those investments with our capital  
  
   43 

contributions, complying with our marketing program which was submitted to the Investment Center, filing of certain reports with the Investment Center, limiting manufacturing outside of Israel and complying with Israeli intellectual property laws. If we do not meet these requirements in the future, these tax benefits may be cancelled and we could be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon. The tax benefits that our current "Approved Enterprise" and "Beneficiary Enterprise" program receives may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at all. If these tax benefits were reduced or eliminated, the amount of taxes that we pay would likely increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if we increase our activities outside of Israel, for example, by acquisitions, our increased activities may not be eligible for inclusion in Israeli tax benefit programs. 
  If we elect to distribute dividends out of income derived from "Approved Enterprise" operations during the tax exemption period, we will be subject to tax on the gross amount distributed. The tax rate will be the rate which would have been applicable had we not been granted the beneficial status. This rate is generally between 10% and the corporate tax rate in Israel, depending on the percentage of our shares held by foreign shareholders. The dividend recipient is subject to withholding tax at the source at the reduced rate applicable to dividends from Approved Enterprises, which is 15% if the dividend is distributed during the tax exemption period (subject to the applicable double tax treaty) or within 12 years after the period. This 12 year limitation does not apply to foreign investment companies. These dividend tax rules may also apply to our acquisitions if they are made with cash from tax benefited income. 
  We have significant intangible assets and goodwill. Consequently, the future impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill, if any, may significantly impact our profitability. 
  Our intangible assets and goodwill are significant. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had recorded $765 million of intangible assets, net and goodwill primarily related to our past acquisitions. Intangible assets and goodwill are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually. The impairment of any goodwill and other intangible assets may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations. 
  Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares  
  The price of our ordinary shares may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our ordinary shares may decline.  
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , our shares traded as low as $39.53 per share and as high as $52.15 per share. During the twelve month period ended   September 30, 2016   our shares traded as low as $37.05 and as high as $55.80 per share.
