Forward Looking Information     

   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Report ),
including  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  in Item 2, contains forward-looking statements about the
business, financial condition and prospects of TOR Minerals International, Inc.
(the  Company ).  The actual results of the Company could differ materially
from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks
and uncertainties including, without limitation, changes in demand for the
Company s products, changes in competition, economic conditions, fluctuations
in exchange rates, changes in the cost of energy, fluctuations in market price
for titanium dioxide ( TiO 2  ) pigments, interest rate fluctuations,
changes in the capital markets, changes in tax and other laws and governmental
rules and regulations applicable to the Company s business, and other risks
indicated in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
including those set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K under
Item 1A. Risk Factors.  These risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of
the Company to control, and, in many cases, the Company cannot predict all of
the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ
materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.  When used
in this report, the words  believes,   estimates,   plans,   expects, 
 anticipates,   foresees,   intends,   may,   likely,   should  and similar expressions
as they relate to the Company or its management are intended to identify
forward-looking statements.

TOR Minerals International, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

Note 1.   

Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates    

  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial
statements (the  financial statements ) have been prepared in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 
The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of TOR Minerals
International, Inc. ( TOR ,  we ,  us ,  our  or the  Company ) and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, TOR Processing and Trade, BV ( TPT ) and TOR
Minerals Malaysia, Sdn. Bhd. ( TMM ).  All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.  All adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the condensed consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods presented have been made.  Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to SEC rules and regulations.  These financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2015, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
SEC on March 7, 2016.  Operating results for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending
December 31, 2016.  

Income Taxes    

  The Company records income taxes using the liability
method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  

Income taxes consisted of federal income tax expense of
approximately $23,000, state income tax expense of approximately $1,000 and
foreign tax expense of approximately $118,000 for the three month period ended September
30, 2016, as compared to a federal tax expense of approximately $237,000, state
tax expense of approximately $5,000 and foreign tax benefit of approximately $220,000
for the same three month period in 2015.    

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, income
taxes consisted of federal income tax benefit of approximately $71,000, state
income tax expense of approximately $4,000 and foreign tax expense of
approximately $232,000, as compared to a federal tax benefit of approximately $31,000,
state tax expense of approximately $5,000 and foreign tax benefit of
approximately $106,000 for the same nine month period in 2015.    

When accounting for uncertainties
in income taxes, we evaluate all tax years still subject to potential audit
under the applicable state, federal and foreign income tax laws.  We are
subject to taxation in the United States, Malaysia and The Netherlands.  Our
federal income tax returns in the United States are subject to examination for
the tax years ended December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2015.  Our state tax
return, which is filed in Texas, is subject to examination for the tax years
ended December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2015.  Our tax returns in various
non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to examination for various tax years dating
back to December 31, 2011.  

As of January 1, 2016, we did not
have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no change during the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016.  In addition, we did not recognize any
interest and penalties in our financial statements during the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016.  If any interest or penalties related to any
income tax liabilities are imposed in future reporting periods, we expect to
record both of these items as components of income tax expense.

Short-term Debt   

U.S. Operations     

  On December 31, 2010, the Company
entered into a credit agreement with American Bank, N.A. (the  Lender ) which
established a $1,000,000 line of credit (the  Line ), and on March 1, 2012, the
Line was increased from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000.  On May 15, 2013, the Company
and the Lender entered into the Second Amendment to the credit agreement which
reduced the minimum interest rate floor from 5.5% to 4.5%.  On May 15, 2015,
the Company and the Lender entered into the Fifth Amendment to the credit agreement
which extended the Line from October 15, 2015 to October 15, 2016.    

On June 23, 2016, the Company and the
Lender amended and restated the credit agreement (the  Agreement ).  Under the
terms of the Agreement, the Lender extended the maturity date on the Line from
October 15, 2016 to October 15, 2017.  In addition, the Company requested that
the Lender reduce the Line from $2,000,000 to $1,000,000.  Under the terms of
the Agreement, the Company is required to maintain positive net earnings before
taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization and all other non-cash charges on a
rolling four-quarter basis.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants
at September 30, 2016.  

Under the terms of the Agreement, the
amount the Company is entitled to borrow under the Line is subject to a
borrowing base, which is based on the loan value of the collateral pledged to
the Lender to secure the indebtedness owing to the Lender by the Company.  Amounts
advanced under the Line bear interest at a variable rate equal to one percent
per annum point above the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate as such prime rate
changes from time to time, with a minimum floor rate of 4.5%.  At September 30,
2016, no funds were outstanding on the Line.  

European Operations     

  On July 13, 2015, TPT amended the short-term banking
facility (the  Amended Agreement ) with Rabobank.  Under the terms of the
Amended Agreement, the TPT line of credit was reduced from  1,100,000 to  500,000
($1,236,000 to $562,000 at September 30, 2016) and interest was changed from a
variable interest rate of bank prime plus 2.8% to the average 1-month EURIBOR
plus the bank margin of 3.3%, which was 2.9% at September 30, 2016.  No funds
were outstanding on the TPT line of credit at September 30, 2016.  

Asian Operations     

  On August 24, 2015, TMM amended its short-term banking
facility with HSBC to extend the maturity date from June 30, 2015 to June 30,
2016.  TMM is currently negotiating with HSBC to extend the maturity date to June
30, 2017. The HSBC facility includes the following in RM:  (1) overdraft line
of credit of RM 500,000 ($121,000 at September 30, 2016); (2) an import/export
line ( ECR ) of RM 10,460,000 ($2,533,000 at September 30, 2016); and (3) a
foreign exchange contract limit of RM 5,000,000 ($1,211,000 at September 30,
2016).  At September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance on the ECR was RM 3,000,000
($726,000 at September 30, 2016) at a current interest rate of 5.0%; and the
outstanding balance on the overdraft line of credit was RM 330,000 ($80,000 at
September 30, 2016) at a current interest rate of 7.85%.  

On August 15, 2014, TMM amended its short term banking
facility with RHB Bank Berhad ( RHB ) to extend the maturity date from March
24, 2014 to April 1, 2015.  TMM is currently negotiating with RHB to extend the
maturity date to April 21, 2017.  The RHB facility includes the following:  (1)
an overdraft line of credit up to RM 1,000,000 ($242,000 at September 30, 2016);
(2) an ECR of RM 7,300,000 ($1,768,000 at September 30, 2016); (3) a bank
guarantee of RM 1,200,000 ($291,000 at September 30, 2016); and (4) a foreign
exchange contract limit of RM 25,000,000 ($6,054,000 at September 30, 2016). 
At September 30, 2016, no funds were outstanding on the RHB facility.  

The banking facilities with both HSBC and RHB bear an
interest rate on the respective overdraft facilities at 1.25% over bank prime,
and the respective ECR facilities bear interest at 1.0% above the funding rate
stipulated by the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad.  The ECR facilities,
which are a government supported financing arrangement specifically for
exporters, are used by TMM for short-term financing of up to 180 days against
customers  and inter-company shipments.  

The borrowings under both the HSBC and the RHB short-term
credit facilities are subject to certain subjective acceleration covenants
based on the judgment of the banks and a demand provision that provides that
the banks may demand repayment at any time.  A demand provision is customary in
Malaysia for such facilities.  The loan agreements are secured by TMM s
property, plant and equipment.  However, if demand is made by HSBC or RHB, we
may be unable to refinance the demanded indebtedness, in which case, the
lenders could foreclose on the assets of TMM.  While repatriation is allowed in
the form of dividends, the credit facilities prohibit TMM from paying
dividends, and the HSBC facility further prohibits loans to related parties
without the prior consent of HSBC.

Fair Value Measurements   

The following table summarizes the valuation of our
financial instruments recorded on a fair value basis as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015.  The Company did not hold any non-financial assets
and/or non-financial liabilities subject to fair value measurements at September
30, 2016 or at December 31, 2015.  The fair value of our financial instruments
as of September 30, 2016, was zero.

Our foreign currency derivative financial instruments mitigate foreign currency
exchange risks and include forward contracts.  The forward contracts are
marked-to-market at each balance sheet date with any resulting gain or loss
recognized in income as part of the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange
rates included under  Other Expense  on the Company s consolidated statement of
operations.  The fair value of the currency forward contracts is determined
using Level 2 inputs based on the currency rate in effect at the end of the
reporting period.  

The fair value of the Company s debt is based on estimates
using standard pricing models and Level 2 inputs, including the Company s
estimated borrowing rate, that take into account the present value of future
cash flows as of the consolidated balance sheet date.  The computation of the
fair value of these instruments is performed by the Company.  The carrying
amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s long-term debt, including
current maturities, are summarized below:  

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and
cash equivalents, trade receivables, payables and accrued liabilities, accrued
income taxes and short-term borrowings approximate fair values due to the short-term
nature of these instruments; accordingly, these items have been excluded from
the above table.

Calculation of Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share   

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share:  

For the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2016, approximately 130,000 employee stock options were excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings per share as the exercise price was greater
than the market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be
anti-dilutive.  

For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015,
approximately 146,000 employee stock options were excluded from the calculation
of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Segment Information   

The Company and its subsidiaries operate in the business of
pigment manufacturing and related products in three geographic segments  
United States, European and Asian.  Our chief operating decision maker, or
CODM, regularly reviews financial information about our segments in order to
allocate resources and evaluate performance.  

Product sales of inventory between the U.S., European and Asian
operations are based on inter-company pricing, which includes an inter-company
profit margin.  The segment income (loss), included in the table below, from each
location is reflective of these inter-company prices, as is inventory at the
Corpus Christi location prior to elimination adjustments.  Such presentation is
consistent with the internal reporting reviewed by the Company s chief
operating decision maker.  The elimination entries include an adjustment to the
cost of sales resulting from the adjustment to ending inventory to eliminate
inter-company profit, and the reversal of a similar adjustment from a prior
period.  To the extent there are net increases/declines period over period in
Corpus Christi inventories that include an inter-company component, the net
effect of these adjustments can decrease/increase location profit.  

Sales from the subsidiary to the parent company are
based upon profit margins which represent competitive pricing of similar
products.  Intercompany sales consist primarily of ALUPREM , Synthetic Rutile, HITOX 
and TIOPREM .  

A summary of the Company s manufacturing operations by
geographic segment is presented below:

Stock Options and Equity Compensation Plan   

For the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded stock-based employee compensation expense of $45,000
and $130,000, respectively, as compared to $29,000 and $104,000 for the same
three and nine month periods of 2015, respectively.  This compensation expense
is included in  selling, general and administrative expenses  in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  

The Company granted 49,000 and 6,000 stock options during
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $180,000
of compensation expense related to non-vested awards.  This expense is expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one year.

Note 8.   

Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments   

The Company has exposure to
certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including financial,
market, political and economic risks.  The following discussion provides
information regarding our exposure to the risks of changing foreign currency
exchange rates.  The Company has not entered into these contracts for trading
or speculative purposes in the past, nor do we currently anticipate entering
into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future.  The
foreign exchange contracts are used to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and
to cover underlying exposures.  

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts    

  We manage the risk of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, primarily at our Malaysian operation, through
the use of foreign currency contracts.  Foreign currency exchange contracts are
used to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows
resulting from transactions in foreign currencies, including sales and
purchases transacted in a currency other than the functional currency, will be
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.  We report the fair value of
the derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair
value are recognized in earnings in the period of the change.  

At September 30, 2016, we marked
these contracts to market resulting in a zero balance to be included on the
consolidated balance sheets as the outstanding contracts were perfectly hedged.  

The following table summarizes
the gross fair market value of all derivative instruments, which are not
designated as hedging instruments, and their location in our consolidated
balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, in thousands:  

For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
  Condition and Results of Operations   

Company Overview    

  We are a global producer of high performance, specialty
mineral products focused on product innovation and technical support.  Our
specialty mineral products, which include flame retardant and smoke suppressant
fillers, engineered fillers, and TiO 2 -color hybrid pigments, are
designed for use in plastics, coating and paint applications, as well as a wide
range of other industrial applications. With operations in the United States,
Europe and Asia, our mission is to bring high value products and superior
levels of service to our customers to help ensure their success.  

Our U.S. operation, located in Corpus Christi, Texas, is
also the global headquarters for the Company.  The U.S. operation manufactures HITOX,
BARTEX, HALTEX/OPTILOAD and TIOPREM.  TPT, our European operation, located in
Hattem, The Netherlands, manufactures ALUPREM alumina based products and BARYPREM
and our Asian operation, located in Ipoh, Malaysia, manufactures HITOX and
TIOPREM.  

Operating expenses in the foreign locations are primarily in
local currencies.  Accordingly, we have exposure to fluctuation in foreign
currency exchange rates.  These fluctuations impact the translation of sales,
earnings, assets and liabilities from local currencies to the U.S. Dollar.  

Our business is closely correlated with the construction
industry and its demand for materials that use pigments, such as paints and
plastics.  This has generally led to higher sales in our second and third
quarters due to increases in construction and maintenance during warmer
weather.  Also, pigment consumption is closely correlated with general economic
conditions.  When the economy is in an expansionary state, there is typically
an increase in pigment consumption, while a slowdown in the economy typically
results in decreased pigment consumption.  When the construction industry or
the economy is in a period of decline, TOR's sales and profits are likely to be
adversely affected.  

We manage our business in three geographical segments
  United States, European and Asia (See Note 6 to our condensed consolidated
financial statements).  Product sales of inventory between the U.S., European
and Asian operations are based on inter-company pricing, which includes an
inter-company profit margin.  Our chief operating decision maker, or CODM,
regularly reviews financial information about our segments in order to allocate
resources and evaluate performance.  Our CODM assesses segment performance
based on Segment sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net
income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, bad debt
expense, foreign currency gains and losses, income taxes, and other items which
management does not believe reflect the underlying performance of the segment.

Operations 

Below are our results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

TOR Minerals International, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations 

Results of Operations     

The Company and its subsidiaries
operate in three geographic segments.  Product sales between the U.S., Asian
and European operations are based on inter-company pricing which includes an
inter-company profit margin.  The inter-company sales are excluded from our
consolidated sales and from the sales of each of our three geographic segments.  

Net Sales    :  Consolidated net sales increased approximately
12% and 1% for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, as compared to the same three and nine month periods of 2015. 
The increase was primarily due to a decrease in selling price and the impact of
the change in foreign currency exchange rates as both the Euro and the Malaysian
Ringgit weakened against the U.S. Dollar.  

Below is a summary of our consolidated products sales for
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in
thousands).  

ALUPREM    sales increased 31% for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to an increase in volume of 35%,
which was partially offset by a decrease in selling price of 4%.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, ALUPREM
sales increased 21%, primarily due to an increase in volume of 24%, which was
partially offset by a decrease in selling price 3%.  

ALUPREM volume increased as a result of an increase in our
customer base as well as an increase in orders from existing customers in both
the U.S. and European markets, while the decrease in selling price relates to a
U.S. customer.  The selling price for this customer will continue to be below
last year s selling price for the balance of 2016.  The order pattern of our
largest ALUPREM customers can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and
does not necessarily follow a normal seasonal pattern.    

HITOX    sales decreased 21% for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to a reduction in volume of 11% and a 10%
reduction in selling price.    

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, HITOX
sales decreased 25%, primarily due to a reduction in volume of 15%, a reduction
of 8% in selling price and the impact of the change in the foreign currency
exchange rates of 2% as the Malaysian Ringgit weakened against the U.S.
Dollar.    

The decrease in sales volume and selling price of HITOX are
primarily due to the continued weakness in the global TiO 2  market,
as well as aggressive pricing pressure from producers of white TiO 2 
in China.  We expect this pressure to continue to affect both volume and
pricing of our global TiO 2  product sales for the balance of the year,
and we expect conditions in the TiO 2  market to remain difficult for
the next several years.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations 

BARTEX /BARYPREM     sales increased
8% for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to
increases in volume and product mix of 6% and 2%, respectively, primarily related
to orders from both new and existing customers.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, BARTEX/BARYPREM
sales decreased 1%, primarily due to a decrease in volume of 2%, which was
partially offset by a shift in product mix of 1%.  The decrease in volume was
primarily related to a reduction in orders from one of our large U.S. BARTEX
customers, which was partially offset by an increase in volume at our European
operation.  

HALTEX /OPTILOAD     sales increased 50% and 24% for the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily due
to an increase in volume of 61% and 27%, respectively, which was offset by a
shift in product mix of 11% and 3%, respectively.  The increase in volume was
primarily due to an increase in our customer base, as well as an increase in
requirements for existing customers.  

TIOPREM    sales increased 16% for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in volume of 52%,
which was partially offset by a shift in product mix of 36%.  The increase in
volume was primarily related to the timing of existing customers  inventory
requirements.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, TIOPREM
sales increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in volume of 31%, which was
partially offset by a reduction in selling price 21% and the impact of the
change in foreign currency of 1% as the Malaysian Ringgit weakened against the
U.S. Dollar.   

Synthetic Rutile ( SR )      For the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016, there were no sales of SR to third parties. 
For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, our collective SR
sales revenue from third-party customers was approximately $14,000.  While
producers of white TiO 2  in China have contributed to the overall
weakness in the global TiO 2  market, we typically only produce SR for
our own internal consumption.  Separately, in 2015, we made a strategic
decision to take our SR production capacity out of service.  We are currently
supplementing our existing SR inventory with product produced by alternate
sources.  By making this strategic move, we expect cost savings as well as a
reduction in our SR inventory levels over the next 12 months.  

Other Product    sales decreased 68% and 43% for the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily due
to a decrease in volume and selling price in the U.S. and Asia.

U.S. Operations     

Below is a summary of net sales for our U.S. operation for
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in
thousands).  All inter-company sales have been eliminated.  

ALUPREM    sales increased 54% for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to an increase in volume of 61%,
which was partially offset by a decrease in selling price of 7%.    

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, ALUPREM
sales increased 32%, primarily due to an increase in volume of 44%, which was
partially offset by a decrease in selling price of 12%.    

The change in volume and selling price primarily relate to a
significant U.S. customer.  While the order pattern of this customer can vary significantly
from quarter to quarter, the selling price will continue to be below last
year s price for the balance of 2016.  

HITOX    sales decreased 28% for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to reductions in volume and selling price
of 19% and 9%, respectively.    

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, HITOX
sales decreased 33%, primarily due to reductions in volume and selling price of
25% and 8%, respectively.  

The decrease in sales volume and selling price of HITOX are
primarily due to the continued weakness in the global TiO 2  market,
as well as aggressive pricing pressure from producers of white TiO 2 
in China.  We expect this pressure to continue to affect both volume and
pricing of our global TiO 2  product sales for the balance of the
year, and we expect conditions in the TiO 2  market to remain
difficult for the next several years.  

BARTEX    sales increased 4% for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to increases in volume and product mix
of 2% and 2%, respectively.    

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, BARTEX
sales decreased 3%, primarily due to a decrease in volume of 4%, which was
partially offset by a shift in product mix of 1%.  The decrease in volume was
primarily related to a reduction in orders from one of our large U.S. BARTEX
customers, which was partially offset by an increase in volume at our European
operation.  

HALTEX/OPTILOAD    sales increased 50% and 24% for the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily due
to an increase in volume of 61% and 27%, respectively, which was offset by a
shift in product mix of 11% and 3%, respectively.  The increase in volume was
primarily due to an increase in our customer base, as well as an increase in
requirements for existing customers.  

TIOPREM    sales for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 increased 8% and 16%, respectively, primarily due to an
increase in volume of 50% and 40%, respectively, which was offset by a shift in
product mix of 42% and 24%, respectively.  
   
   Other Product    sales for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 decreased 68% and 39%, respectively, due to a decrease
in volume of 63% and 35%, respectively, and a decrease in selling price of 5%
and 4%, respectively.

Operations 

European Operations     

TPT manufactures and sells ALUPREM to third-party customers,
as well as to our U.S. operations for distribution to our North American
customers.  TPT purchases HITOX from our Asian operation and TIOPREM from our
U.S. operation for distribution in Europe.  The following table represents
TPT s sales (in thousands) for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 to third-party customers.  All inter-company sales have been
eliminated.  

ALUPREM    sales in Europe increased 6% for the three
month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in sales
volume of 7%, which was partially offset by a change in product mix of 1%.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, ALUPREM
sales increased 8%, primarily due to changes in product mix and sales volume of
4% and 4%, respectively.  

The increase in volume and change in product mix for
European ALUPREM sales revenue is primarily related to an increase in demand by
existing and new customers as well as an expansion in the diversity of our
ALUPREM products.  

BARYPREM    sales in Europe increased 36% for the three
month period ended September 30, 2016 due to an increase in volume of 35% and the
impact of the change in foreign currency which increased sales revenue 1% as
the Euro strengthened against the U.S. Dollar.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, BAYPREM
sales increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in volume of 13%, which was
partially offset by a change in product mix of 1%.  

HITOX    sales in Europe increased 17% during the three
month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in volume
of 23%, which was partially offset by a decrease in selling price of 6%.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, HITOX
sales increased 5%, primarily due to an increase in volume of 13%, which was
partially offset by a decrease in selling price of 7% and the impact of the
change in foreign currency which decreased sales revenue 1%.  

The European HITOX sales continue to be impacted by the
overall weakness in the global TiO 2  market.  

TIOPREM    sales decreased 100% for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, due to a decrease in volume primarily related
to the timing of orders from existing customers.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, TIOPREM
sales decreased 34%, primarily due to decreases in volume and selling price of
19% and 15%, respectively.

Asian Operations     

TMM manufactures and sells HITOX and TIOPREM to third-party
customers, as well as to our U.S. and European operations.  The following table
represents TMM s sales (in thousands) for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 to third-party customers.  All inter-company
sales have been eliminated.  

HITOX    sales in Asia decreased 14% for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in selling price
of 15%, which was partially offset by an increase in volume of 1%.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, HITOX
sales decreased 9%, primarily due to a decrease in selling price and the impact
of the change in foreign currency of 9% and 8%, respectively, which was
partially offset by an increase in volume of 8%.  

The HITOX market in Asia continues to decline due to the
weakness in the TiO2 market, as well as the entry into the TiO 2 
market by producers of white TiO 2  in China.  We expect this pressure
to continue to affect pricing of our global TiO 2  product sales for
the balance of the year, and we expect conditions in the TiO 2  market
to remain difficult for the next several years.  

TIOPREM    sales in Asia increased for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016, due to an increase in volume.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, TIOPREM
sales decreased 23%, primarily due to a decrease in volume and the impact of
the change in foreign currency of 12% and 11%, respectively.  

Synthetic Rutile ( SR )            For the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016, there were no sales of SR to third
parties.  For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, our collective

Other Consolidated Results     

Gross Margin     :     The following table
represents our net sales, cost of sales and gross margin for the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, in thousands.  

For each of the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016, gross margin increased approximately 4% as compared to the same three
and nine month period of 2015, primarily due to higher production volume and
improved efficiencies, primarily at TPT, which increased the gross margin approximately
2%, and the elimination of idle plant costs related to the SR plant at TMM improved
the gross margin approximately 2%.  

Selling, General, Administrative and Expenses
( SG A )     :     SG A expense increased approximately 13% during
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to increases
in professional fees, sales expense and salaries of approximately 5%, 4% and
3%, respectively.  

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, SG A
expense decreased approximately 2%, primarily related to a decrease in selling
expense of approximately 8%, which was partially offset by increases in
salaries and professional fees of approximately 4% and 2%, respectively.  

Interest Expense     :     Net interest expense
increased approximately $6,000 for the three month period ended September 30,
2016, primarily due to an increase in our average long-term financing at our
European Operation, and decreased $37,000 for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016 due to a decrease in our average long-term and short-term financing
at the U.S. and Asian operations, which was partially offset by an increase at
the European operation.  

Income Taxes     :    Income taxes consisted of
federal income tax expense of approximately $23,000, state income tax expense
of approximately $1,000 and foreign tax expense of approximately $118,000 for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a federal tax expense
of approximately $237,000, state tax expense of approximately $5,000 and
foreign tax benefit of approximately $220,000 for the same three month period
in 2015.    

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, income
taxes consisted of federal income tax benefit of approximately $71,000, state
income tax expense of approximately $4,000 and foreign tax expense of
approximately $232,000, as compared to a federal tax benefit of approximately $31,000,
state tax expense of approximately $5,000 and foreign tax benefit of
approximately $106,000 for the same nine month period in 2015.  

The increase in income tax expense for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016, relates to an increase in taxable income for
the three and nine month periods of 2016.

U.S. Operations     

  On December 31, 2010, the Company
entered into a credit agreement with American Bank, N.A. (the  Lender ) which
established a $1,000,000 line of credit (the  Line ), and on March 1, 2012, the
Line was increased from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000.  On May 15, 2013, the Company
and the Lender entered into the Second Amendment to the credit agreement which
reduced the minimum interest rate floor from 5.5% to 4.5%.  On May 15, 2015,
the Company and the Lender entered into the Fifth Amendment to the credit
agreement which extended the Line from October 15, 2015 to October 15, 2016.    

On June 23, 2016, the Company and
the Lender amended and restated the credit agreement (the  Agreement ).  Under
the terms of the Agreement, the Lender extended the maturity date on the Line
from October 15, 2016 to October 15, 2017.  In addition, the Company requested
that the Lender reduce the Line from $2,000,000 to $1,000,000.  Under the terms
of the Agreement, the Company is required to maintain positive net earnings
before taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization and all other non-cash
charges on a rolling four-quarter basis.  The Company was in compliance with
all covenants at September 30, 2016.  

Under the terms of the Agreement, the
amount the Company is entitled to borrow under the Line is subject to a
borrowing base, which is based on the loan value of the collateral pledged to
the Lender to secure the indebtedness owing to the Lender by the Company. 
Amounts advanced under the Line bear interest at a variable rate equal to one
percent per annum point above the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate as such prime
rate changes from time to time, with a minimum floor rate of 4.5%.  At
September 30, 2016, no funds were outstanding on the Line.  

European Operations     

  On July 13, 2015, TPT amended the short-term banking
facility (the  Amended Agreement ) with Rabobank.  Under the terms of the
Amended Agreement, the TPT line of credit was reduced from  1,100,000 to
 500,000 ($1,236,000 to $562,000 at September 30, 2016) and interest was changed
from a variable interest rate of bank prime plus 2.8% to the average 1-month
EURIBOR plus the bank margin of 3.3%, which was 2.9% at September 30, 2016.  No
funds were outstanding on the TPT line of credit at September 30, 2016.

  On August 24, 2015, TMM amended its short-term banking
facility with HSBC to extend the maturity date from June 30, 2015 to June 30,
2016.  TMM is currently negotiating with HSBC to extend the maturity date to June
30, 2017. The HSBC facility includes the following in RM:  (1) overdraft line
of credit of RM 500,000 ($121,000 at September 30, 2016); (2) an import/export
line ( ECR ) of RM 10,460,000 ($2,533,000 at September 30, 2016); and (3) a
foreign exchange contract limit of RM 5,000,000 ($1,211,000 at September 30,
2016).  At September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance on the ECR was RM
3,000,000 ($726,000 at September 30, 2016) at a current interest rate of 5.0%;
and the outstanding balance on the overdraft line of credit was RM 330,000
($80,000 at September 30, 2016) at a current interest rate of 7.85%.

TOR Minerals International, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations 

The banking facilities with both
HSBC and RHB bear an interest rate on the respective overdraft facilities at
1.25% over bank prime, and the respective ECR facilities bear interest at 1.0%
above the funding rate stipulated by the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia
Berhad.  The ECR facilities, which are a government supported financing
arrangement specifically for exporters, are used by TMM for short-term
financing of up to 180 days against customers  and inter-company shipments.  

The borrowings under both the HSBC and the RHB short-term
credit facilities are subject to certain subjective acceleration covenants
based on the judgment of the banks and a demand provision that provides that
the banks may demand repayment at any time.  A demand provision is customary in
Malaysia for such facilities.  The loan agreements are secured by TMM s
property, plant and equipment.  However, if demand is made by HSBC or RHB, we
may be unable to refinance the demanded indebtedness, in which case, the
lenders could foreclose on the assets of TMM.  While repatriation is allowed in
the form of dividends, the credit facilities prohibit TMM from paying
dividends, and the HSBC facility further prohibits loans to related parties
without the prior consent of HSBC.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

  Cash and cash equivalents increased $2,269,000 from December
31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Operating activities provided $3,063,000 and
financing activities provided $100,000; and we used $894,000 in investing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Operating Activities    

  Below are the major changes in working capital affecting
cash provided by operating activities during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016.  

Trade Accounts Receivable     :     Accounts
receivable used cash of $751,000 during the first nine months of 2016.  The increase
in accounts receivable is primarily related to the timing of sales between the
fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, primarily at the U.S. operation. 
Accounts receivable increased $704,000 and $53,000 at the U.S. operation and at
TPT, respectively, and decreased $6,000 at TMM.   

Inventories     : 
	Inventories provided cash of $1,105,000 during the first nine months of
	2016.  Inventories at the U.S. operation decreased $355,000, primarily
	related to a decrease in raw materials.  TMM s inventory decreased
	approximately $1,482,000, primarily related to a decrease in raw materials
	and work in progress.  TPT s inventory increased approximately $732,000,
	primarily related to an increase in raw materials.    

Other Current Assets     :     Other current assets used
cash of $5,000 during the first nine months of 2016.  Current assets at the U.S.
operation increased $37,000.  TMM s current assets increased $84,000, primarily
related to the timing of insurance premiums.  TPT s current assets decreased $116,000,
primarily due to timing of a VAT tax refund and a reduction in equipment
deposits, which were partially offset by an increase related to the timing of
insurance premiums.

Investing Activities    

  We used cash of $894,000 in investing activities during the first
nine months of 2016 related to equipment purchases and plant expansion at our U.S.
and European locations.  Net investments are as follows:  

Property, Plant and Equipment    

U.S. Operation     :     We invested approximately $251,000
during the first nine months of 2016 for new production equipment designed to

Financing Activities    

  Financing activities provided cash of $100,000 during the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016.  Significant factors relating to
financing activities include the following:  

Lines of Credit    

U.S. Operation:      Borrowings on our U.S. line of
credit were not utilized by the Company during the nine month period ended September

credit were not utilized during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.

$1,398,000 from the issuance of 527,681 shares of common stock related to the
exercise of detachable warrants, with an exercise price of $2.65.  The warrants
were issued in May 2009 with our six percent (6%) convertible subordinated
debentures and matured May 4, 2016.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations   

  No material changes have been made to the     Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations     noted in the Company s 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Item 4.    

Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

  Under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of
the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms; and (ii) to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes in Internal Controls    

  During the last fiscal quarter, there were no changes in the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over
financial reporting.

Item 2.    

Unregistered Sales
  of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

As reported in the
Company s filing on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on May 2, 2016, on April 29, 2016, three holders, two of whom are directors of
the Company and another who is a greater than 5% shareholder, exercised 377,360
warrants which were issued in August 2009.  In addition, several other holders
exercised 128,304 warrants.  Upon exercise and receipt of the aggregate
exercise price of $1,340,010, the Company issued 505,664 shares of common stock
to the investors.    

Prior to maturity on May
4, 2016, two other holders exercised 22,017 warrants with an aggregate exercise
price of $53,345, which increased the total shares of common stock issued to
527,681 at an aggregate exercise price of $1,398,355.  The Company used the proceeds
for working capital purposes.  

No underwriters were
involved in the foregoing sale of securities and there were no expenses related
to the issuance.  The common stock to be issued upon exercise of the warrants
was issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section
4(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, based on the private sale of
securities.  The sale of the common stock issued upon exercise of these
warrants was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-175054), filed with the SEC on June 30, 2011.
