NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION:    
  SYNNEX Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, herein referred to as  SYNNEX  or the  Company ) is a business process services company headquartered in Fremont, California and has operations in North and South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. 
  The Company operates in   two   segments: Technology Solutions and Concentrix. The Technology Solutions segment distributes a broad range of information technology ( IT ) systems and products and also provides systems design and integration solutions. The Concentrix segment offers a portfolio of strategic solutions and end-to-end global business outsourcing services focused on customer engagement strategy, process optimization, technology innovation, front and back-office automation and business transformation to clients in   ten   identified industry verticals. 
  The accompanying interim unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements as of   August 31, 2016   and for the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015   have been prepared by the Company in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The amounts as of   November 30, 2015   have been derived from the Company s annual audited financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the financial position of the Company and its results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   November 30, 2015  .  
  The results of operations for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending November 30,   2016  , or any future period and the Company makes no representations related thereto. 

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:    
  The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   November 30, 2015  . There have been no material changes to these accounting policies. For a discussion of the significant accounting policies, please see the discussion in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   November 30, 2015  . 
  Concentration of credit risk    
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative instruments. 
  The Company s cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments are transacted and maintained with financial institutions with high credit standing and the compositions and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. Through   August 31, 2016  , the Company had not experienced any credit losses on such deposits and derivative instruments.    
  Accounts receivable include amounts due from customers and original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) vendors primarily in the technology industry. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers  financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally requires no collateral. The Company also maintains allowances for potential credit losses. In estimating the required allowances, the Company takes into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio, the existence of a limited amount of credit insurance and specifically identified customer and vendor risks. Through   August 31, 2016  , such losses have been within management s expectations.    
  One customer accounted for   12%   and   10%   of the Company's total revenue during the three and nine months ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively. During both the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015  , no customer accounted for   10%   or more of the Company's total revenue. Products purchased from the Company s largest OEM supplier, HP Inc. (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) ( HP ), accounted for approximately   16%   and   17%   of total revenue during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   27%   and   25%   of total revenue during the   three   and   nine

months ended   August 31, 2015  , respectively. During the three and nine months ended   August 31, 2015  , HP included both HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. 
  As of both   August 31, 2016   and November 30,   2015  ,   no   customer comprised   10%   of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance.  
  Book overdrafts 
  Book overdrafts, representing checks issued in excess of balances on deposit in the applicable bank accounts and which have not been paid by the applicable bank at the balance sheet date are classified as  Borrowings, current  in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the terms of the Company s banking arrangements, the respective financial institutions are not legally obligated to honor the book overdraft balances. The Company s policy is to report the change in book overdrafts as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed based on the weighted-average method. Inventories are comprised of finished goods and work-in-process. Finished goods include products purchased for resale, system components purchased for both resale and for use in the Company s systems design and integration business, and completed systems. Work-in-process inventories are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. 
  Recently issued accounting pronouncements    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an amendment to the statement of cash flows. It addresses eight specific cash flow issues to clarify the presentation and classification of cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice exists. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued a new credit loss standard that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP. The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard which revises various aspects of accounting for leases. The most significant impact to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements relates to the recognition by a lessee of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of its leases other than short-term leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. For income statement purposes, operating leases will result in a straight line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. This accounting standard will be applicable to the Company at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is

permitted. The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption and is currently evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements upon the adoption of this new standard. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. With respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the most significant impact relates to the accounting for equity investments (other than those that are consolidated or accounted under the equity method) which will be measured at fair value through earnings. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted only for certain provisions. The amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with other amendments related specifically to equity securities without readily determinable fair values applied prospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on a company's balance sheet. The new standard should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. Consistent with existing guidance, the new guidance requires an acquirer to disclose the nature and amount of measurement period adjustments. In addition, companies are required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the adjustment recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The new standard should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date. For public business entities, the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory. It replaces the current lower of cost or market test with the lower of cost or net realizable value test. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If the cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new standard may be applied prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB clarified that for a line-of-credit arrangement, a company can continue to defer and present the debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequent amortization of debt issuance costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard for contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of this standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB amended this accounting standard and postponed the implementation date to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 is permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. This accounting standard will be applicable to the Company at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements upon the adoption of this new standard. 

NOTE 3 ACQUISITION: 
  On August 1, 2016, the Company acquired   100%   of the Minacs group of companies ( Minacs ), which provide integrated business process outsourcing services, for a preliminary purchase price of   $435,635  , subject to certain post-closing adjustments. As of August 31, 2016, the Company had paid   $425,903   and was obligated to pay an amount of   $9,732   in cash. This remaining amount may be adjusted based upon the final value of the net tangible assets acquired. 
  The acquisition has been included in the Concentrix segment. Minacs provides greater scale and strengthens the Company s position as a top global provider of customer engagement services, enhances domain expertise in Concentrix s automotive industry vertical and accelerates Marketing Optimization and Internet of Things solutions with Minacs  proprietary technology. 
  The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their preliminary fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible assets and preliminary intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill balance is attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities due to domain expertise in the automotive industry vertical and enhanced technology platforms resulting from the acquisition. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, fair value of operating leases assumed, income and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill. The Company expects to continue to obtain information for the purpose of determining the fair value of the net assets acquired at the closing date during the measurement period and the amount of goodwill that will be deductible for tax purposes.

NOTE 6 INVESTMENTS:    
  The carrying amount of the Company s investments is shown in the table below:    

Short-term held-to-maturity investments primarily consist of term deposits with maturities from the date of purchase greater than   three   months and less than   one   year. These term deposits are held until the maturity date and are not traded. Long-term available-for-sale securities primarily consist of investments in other companies  equity securities. Long-term cost-method investments consist of investments in equity securities of private entities. 
  Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value in each reporting period and therefore the carrying value of these securities equals their fair value. For cost-method securities, the Company records an impairment charge when the decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair value of cost-method investments is based on an internal valuation of the investees. 
  The Company recorded a gain of   $0   and   $50   in  Other income (expense), net  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015  , respectively, for changes in the fair value of the Company's trading investments. There were no trading investments during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  . 

NOTE 7 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity risk and credit risk. The Company s transactions in most of its foreign operations are primarily denominated in local currency. The Company enters into transactions, and owns monetary assets and liabilities, that are denominated in currencies other than the legal entity's functional currency. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset a portion of the risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. 
  All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of a derivative are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Other income (expense), net  or as a component of  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below. 
  As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses short-term forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. These forward-exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. The forward exchange contracts are recorded at fair value in each reporting period and any gains or losses, resulting from the changes in fair value, are recorded in earnings in the period of change.  
  In May 2015, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of   $400,000   to economically convert a portion of its variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest expense are recognized in  Other income (expense), net  in the same

period as the related expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in  Other income (expense), net.  
  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent   two  -month time period. Deferred gains and losses in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into  Other income (expense), net.  Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in  Other income (expense), net  unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.  
  Generally, the Company does not use derivative instruments to cover equity risk and credit risk. The Company s policy is not to allow the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The fair values of the Company s derivative instruments are also disclosed in Note 8.  
  The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments as of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  : 

The notional amounts of the foreign exchange forward contracts that were outstanding as of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015   were     $256,876     and     $251,677  , respectively. The notional amounts represent the gross amounts of foreign currency, including the Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen, Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso, Australian Dollar and Philippine Peso, that will be bought or sold at maturity. The contracts mature in   six   months or less. In relation to its forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recorded losses of   $1,668     and   $6,126   during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively, and gains of   $3,518   and   $15,252   during the   three   and   nine   months ended on   August 31, 2015  , respectively, in  Other income (expense), net.  The losses on the Company s foreign currency forward contracts are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged assets or liabilities. 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , the Company recorded losses before tax of   $1,857   and   $8,120  , respectively, and a loss before tax of   $1,050   and   $2,937  , respectively for the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015  , in  Other comprehensive income (loss)  related to changes in the fair value of its derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedging instruments. For the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , there was no hedge ineffectiveness related to these derivative instruments. For the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , there were no gains or losses recognized in earnings associated with an underlying exposure that did not, or was not expected to, occur; nor are there any anticipated in the normal course of business within the next twelve months.  
  In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements. If derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement had been netted in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the total derivative asset and liability positions would have been reduced by   $1,506   each as of   August 31, 2016   and   $1,168   each as of November 30,   2015  . 
  Credit exposure for derivative financial instruments is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties  obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. We manage the potential risk of credit losses

through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing and selection of counterparties from a limited group of financial institutions. 

NOTE 8 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:    
  The Company s fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:     
  Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;  
  Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;  
  Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).  
  The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company s investments and financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:     

The Company's cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments in money market funds and term deposits with maturity periods of three months or less. Restricted cash relates primarily to restrictions under bank guarantees, borrowing arrangements and the Minacs acquisition arrangement.     The carrying values of the cash equivalents approximate fair value since they are near their maturity. Investments in available-for-sale securities consist of equity securities and are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices. The fair values of forward exchange contracts are measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers. Fair values of interest rate swaps are measured using standard valuation models using inputs that are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, including LIBOR spot and forward rates. The effect of nonperformance risk on the fair value of derivative instruments was not material as of   August 31, 2016   and November 30,   2015  . 
  The acquisition-related contingent consideration liability represented the future potential earn-out payments relating to an acquisition. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was based on the Company s probability assessment of the established profitability measures during the earn-out period ranging from   one   to   three   years from the date of the acquisition. The liability was settled during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  .

The carrying values of held-to-maturity securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate fair value due to their short maturities and interest rates which are variable in nature. The carrying value of the Company's term loans approximate their fair value since they bear interest rates that are similar to existing market rates. 
  During the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , there were no transfers between the fair value measurement category levels. 

NOTE 9 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARRANGEMENTS:    
  The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program to provide additional capital for its operations in the United States (the  U.S. Arrangement ). The U.S. Arrangement has a maturity date of November 4, 2016. One of the Company s subsidiaries, which is the borrower under the U.S. Arrangement, can borrow up to a maximum of   $600,000   based upon eligible trade accounts receivable generated by the parent company and one of its United States subsidiaries. The U.S. Arrangement includes an accordion feature to allow requests for an increase in the lenders' commitment by an additional   $100,000  . The effective borrowing cost under the U.S. Arrangement is a blended rate that includes prevailing dealer commercial paper rates and the daily London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), plus a program fee of   0.375%   p  er annum based on the used portion of the commitment, and a facility fee of   0.40%   per annum payable on the aggregate commitment of the lenders. As of   August 31, 2016  ,   $91,500   was outstanding under the U.S. Arrangement. There were no borrowings outstanding as of   November 30, 2015  . 
  Under the terms of the U.S. Arrangement, the Company and one of the Company s United States subsidiaries sell, on a revolving basis, their receivables (other than certain specifically excluded receivables) to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. The borrowings are funded by pledging all of the rights, title and interest in and to the receivables acquired by the Company's bankruptcy-remote subsidiary as security. Any borrowings under the U.S. Arrangement are recorded as debt on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As is customary in trade accounts receivable securitization arrangements like the U.S. Arrangement, where some of the loans are funded through one or more lender s affiliated asset-backed commercial paper programs, a credit rating agency's downgrade of the third party issuer of commercial paper or of a back-up liquidity provider (which provides a source of funding if the commercial paper market cannot be accessed) could result in an increase in the Company's cost of borrowing or loss of the Company's financing capacity under these programs if the commercial paper issuer or liquidity back-up provider is not replaced, or if the lender whose commercial paper issuer or liquidity back-up provider is not replaced does not elect to offer the Company an alternative rate. Loss of such financing capacity could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
  In January 2016, the Company entered into an uncommitted supply-chain financing program with a United States financial institution under which trade accounts receivable of a certain customer may be acquired, without recourse, by the financial institution. Available capacity under this program is dependent on the level of our trade accounts receivable with this customer and the financial institution s willingness to purchase such receivables. As of   August 31, 2016  , accounts receivable sold to and held by the financial institution under this program were   $58,238  . During the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , discount fees of   $318   and   $696   related to the sale of trade accounts receivable under this facility, respectively, were included in  Interest expense and finance charges, net  in the consolidated statement of operations. 
  The Company also has other financing agreements in North America with various financial institutions ( Flooring Companies ) to allow certain customers of the Company to finance their purchases directly with the Flooring Companies. Under these agreements, the Flooring Companies pay to the Company the selling price of products sold to various customers, less a discount, within approximately   15   to   30   days from the date of sale. The Company is contingently liable to repurchase inventory sold under flooring agreements in the event of any default by its customers under the agreement and such inventory being repossessed by the Flooring Companies. Please see Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies for further information.

  Employees of SYNNEX Infotec were also covered by a multi-employer plan until fiscal year 2015. The Company recognized expense for this plan based on scheduled employer contributions. Employees could also make contributions to this plan.

During the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , the Company contributed   $90   and   $252   to the defined contribution plan.  
  The Company has a 401(k) Plan (the  Plan ) under which eligible employees may contribute up to the maximum amount as provided by law.

NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: 
  The Company leases certain of its facilities under operating lease agreements, which expire in various periods through 2025. Future minimum rental obligations under noncancellable lease agreements as of   August 31, 2016   were as follows: 

During the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , rent expense was   $26,395   and   $76,998  , respectively. During the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015  , rent expense was $  24,198   and   $69,444  , respectively. Sublease income was immaterial for each of the periods presented and is immaterial for the amounts entitled to be received in future periods under non-cancellable sublease arrangements. 
  The Company was contingently liable as of   August 31, 2016   under agreements to repurchase repossessed inventory acquired by flooring companies as a result of default on floor plan financing arrangements by the Company's customers. These arrangements are described in Note 9     Accounts Receivable Arrangements and do not have expiration dates. As the Company does not have access to information regarding the amount of inventory purchased from the Company still on hand with the customer at any point in time, the Company s repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated. Losses, if any, would be the difference between the repossession cost and the resale value of the inventory. There have been no repurchases through   August 31, 2016   under these agreements and the Company is not aware of any pending customer defaults or repossession obligations. The Company believes that, based on historical experience, the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to these inventory repurchase obligations is remote. 
  From time to time, the Company receives notices from third parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking indemnification, payment of money or other actions in connection with claims made against them. Also, from time to time, the Company has been involved in various bankruptcy preference actions where the Company was a supplier to the companies now in bankruptcy. In addition, the Company is subject to various other claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company is currently not involved in any material proceedings. 
  In December 2009, the Company sold China Civilink (Cayman), which operated in China as HiChina Web Solutions, to Alibaba.com Limited. In conjunction with this sale, the Company has recorded a contingent indemnification liability of   $4,122  . 
  Guarantees    
  The Company, as the ultimate parent, guaranteed the obligations of SYNNEX Investment Holdings Corporation up to   $35,035   in connection with the sale of China Civilink (Cayman), which operated in China as HiChina Web Solutions, to Alibaba.com Limited. The guarantee expires in fiscal year 2018. 
  The Company does not believe that the above commitments and contingencies will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Our portfolio of services includes end-to-end process outsourcing to customers in various industry vertical markets delivered through omni-channels that include both voice and non-voice mediums and in more than 40 languages. Our portfolio of solutions and services support our clients and their customers globally. 
  From a geographic perspective, approximately   74%   and   73%   of our total revenue was from the United States for the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   76%   and   74%   for the three and nine months ended   August 31, 2015  , respectively. The revenue attributable to countries is based on geographical locations from where products are delivered or from where customer service contracts are managed. Approximately   41%   and   48%   of our net property and equipment was located in the United States as of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , respectively. As of   August 31, 2016  , we had approximately   107,000   full-time and temporary employees worldwide.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   from our disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   November 30, 2015  . For more information on all of our critical accounting policies, please see the discussion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   November 30, 2015   and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Acquisitions 
  We continually seek to augment organic growth in both our business segments with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our existing capabilities. We also divest businesses that we deem no longer strategic to our ongoing operations. In our Technology Solutions business we seek to enhance our supply chain and integration capabilities, acquire new OEM relationships and the services we provide to our OEM suppliers and customers. In our Concentrix segment we seek to extend the geographic reach of our operations, particularly in targeted markets, and make investments in branding and thought leadership, and in attracting and developing talent-to further enhance our key capabilities, process expertise and competitiveness in our key verticals. 
  Fiscal year 2016 acquisition 
  On August 1, 2016,     we acquired the Minacs group of companies ( Minacs ), which provide integrated business process outsourcing services, for a preliminary purchase price of     $435.6 million  , subject to certain post-closing adjustments. As of August 31, 2016, we had paid   $425.9 million   and were obligated to pay an amount of     $9.7 million     in cash.  
  The purchase price allocation consisted of   $67.2 million   of net tangible assets,   $147.1 million   of intangible assets and   $221.4 million   of goodwill. The purchase price allocation is preliminary, subject to finalization of valuation procedures. 
  The acquisition has been included in the Concentrix segment. The acquisition provides greater scale and strengthens our position as a top global provider of customer engagement services, enhances domain expertise in Concentrix' automotive industry vertical and accelerates Marketing Optimization and Internet of Things solutions with Minacs' proprietary technology.

Results of Operations    
  The following table sets forth, for the indicated periods, data as percentages of revenue:    

Certain non-GAAP financial information 
  In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including: 
             
    Revenue in constant currency, which is revenue adjusted for the translation effect of foreign currencies so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company's business performance. Revenue in constant currency is calculated by translating the revenue for the three and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , in local currency using the comparable prior periods' currency conversion rates. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. 
                
    Non-GAAP operating income, which is operating income as adjusted to exclude acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring costs and amortization of intangible assets. 
                
    Non-GAAP operating margin, which is Non-GAAP operating income (as defined above) divided by revenue. 
                
    Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, which is Non-GAAP operating income as defined above after excluding depreciation. 
                
    Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share ( EPS ), which is diluted EPS excluding the per share, tax effected impact of (i) acquisition and integration expenses, (ii) restructuring costs, and (iii) amortization of intangible assets. 
     Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods and for planning and forecasting in future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in some cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to,  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, because these non-GAAP measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Information: 

_____________________________________ 
    
  (1) The tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments was calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for the periods presented. 
    
  (2) The sum of the components of Non-GAAP Diluted EPS may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.

Three and Nine Months Ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015    
  Revenue    

In our Technology Solutions segment, we distribute in excess of   30,000   technology products (as measured by active SKUs) from more than   300   IT, CE and OEM suppliers to more than   20,000   resellers. The prices of our products are highly dependent on the volumes purchased within a product category. The products we sell from one period to the next are often not comparable because of rapid changes in product models and features. The revenue generated in our Concentrix segment relates to global business services process optimization, customer engagement strategy and back office automation. Inter-segment elimination represents services and transactions generated between our reportable segments that are eliminated on consolidation. 
  Revenue in our Technology Solutions segment increased during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to seasonally strong demand in our fiscal third quarter for our systems design and integration solutions primarily in the United States and United Kingdom and higher sales in Canada, partially offset by weaker demand in Japan. Revenue in our Technology Solutions segment during the three months ended August 31, 2016 also benefited from foreign currency translation, primarily from the strengthening of the Japanese Yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian Dollar. Revenue during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation, primarily from the weakening of the Canadian Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen. On a constant currency basis, revenue in our Technology Solutions segment during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   increased   9.0%   and   4.3%  , respectively. 
  Revenue in our Concentrix segment increased during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the Minacs acquisition effective August 1, 2016, offset partially by the planned lapsing of a government contract. The Minacs acquisition contributed $36.2 million of revenue during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  . This increase was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation, primarily from the weakening of the British Pound, Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupee, which was partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen. On a constant currency basis, revenue in the Concentrix segment excluding revenue contributed from the Minacs acquisition increased   5.0%   and 3.0% during the   three   and nine months ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively. 
  Gross Profit 

Our gross margin is affected by a variety of factors, including our sources of revenue by segments, competition, average selling prices, mix of products and services we sell, our customers, product costs along with rebate and discount programs from our suppliers, reserves or settlement adjustments, freight costs, charges for inventory losses, acquisitions and divestitures of business units and fluctuations in revenue. Concentrix margins, which are generally higher than those in our Technology Solutions segment, can be impacted by additional lead time for programs to be fully scalable, and transition and initial set-up costs. 
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

Gross profit during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 increased compared to the corresponding prior year periods primarily due to higher sales in both segments and improved margins in our Concentrix segment. 
  Gross profit in our Technology Solutions segment increased during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year period, primarily due to seasonally strong demand for our system design and integration solutions in the United States and the United Kingdom. Gross margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the prior year period as a result of product mix. Gross profit during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was consistent with the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, gross profit in the Technology Solutions segment increased $2.3 million during the nine months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year period. Gross margin decreased during the nine months ended August 31, 2016, primarily due to foreign currency exchange benefits associated with our system design and integration solutions recorded during the   nine   months ended August 31, 2015 and changes in product mix. 
  Gross profit in our Concentrix segment increased during both the   three   and nine months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the Minacs acquisition and the improved performance from one previously loss-making contract. This contract generated profit of $7.5 million and $0.3 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, respectively, while the contract incurred losses of $5.0 million and $20.3 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2015, respectively. Gross margin in our Concentrix segment improved during both the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the contract discussed above and the lapsing of one government contract that had lower than average gross margin. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs such as salaries, commissions, bonuses, share-based compensation and temporary personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs incurred in relation to the acquisition and integration of businesses, cost of facilities, utility expenses, professional fees, depreciation on our capital equipment, bad debt expense, amortization of our intangible assets, and marketing expenses, offset in part by reimbursements from our OEM suppliers. 
  The increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , compared to the prior year periods, was primarily the result of the Minacs acquisition and higher depreciation and facility costs of $2.8 million and $17.8 million, respectively, to support Concentrix growth. We also incurred $0.3 million and $4.3 million of restructuring costs primarily related to lease termination and employee related costs for closed business activities in three Concentrix delivery centers in North America during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016, respectively. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weakening of the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Indian Rupee and Philippine Peso. The increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses was also offset by lower amortization of intangible assets of $0.7 million and $5.3 million during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively. In addition, acquisition and integration expenses increased $0.3 million and decreased $4.1 million in our Concentrix segment during the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively, compared to prior year periods.

Operating income 

The operating income and margin in our Technology Solutions segment during the   three   months ended August 31, 2016 increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher sales volume and effective management of our operating expenses. Technology Solutions' operating income during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was consistent with the prior year period and operating margin decreased due to product mix and the foreign currency exchange benefits associated with systems design and integration solutions recorded during the prior year period. 
  The operating income and margin in our Concentrix segment increased during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year period primarily due to the improved profit and margin from the previously loss-making contract discussed above. Operating income and margin decreased during the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to prior year period, primarily due to higher depreciation and facility costs and $4.3 million of restructuring and site closure costs. The decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily due to the weakening of the Indian Rupee and Philippines Peso, and improvement in gross profit associated with the previously loss-making contract and the impact of the Minacs acquisition.  
  Interest Expense and Finance Charges, Net 

Amounts recorded in interest expense and finance charges, net, consist primarily of interest expense paid on our lines of credit and other debt, fees associated with third party accounts receivable flooring arrangements and the sale or pledge of accounts receivable through our securitization facilities, offset by income earned on our cash investments.  
  Our interest expense and finance charges, net, during the three and nine months ended   August 31, 2016   increased compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of additional borrowings during the three months ended August 31, 2016 to fund the Minacs acquisition and higher interest rates on our term loan in the United States. In May 2015, we borrowed an additional $411.3 million under an increased term loan commitment in the United States and paid down our United States securitization arrangement and revolving line of credit to secure higher credit availability. The term loan carries a higher rate of interest than our revolving lines of credit and our accounts receivable securitization arrangement. At the same time, we entered into step-up interest rate swaps, which effectively converted a portion of our floating rate term loan in the United States to a fixed interest rate, which is higher than the prevailing floating rate. The fixed rate on the swaps steps up to a higher rate each year.

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Amounts recorded as other income (expense), net, include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, investment gains and losses (including those in our deferred compensation plan) and other non-operating gains and losses. 
  The decrease in other income (expense), net, during the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses and impair losses of our cost-method investments, partially offset by a $0.9 million benefit received from a class-action legal settlement in our Technology Solutions segment.  
  The increase in other income (expense), net, during the nine months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a   $5.0 million   benefit received from class-action legal settlements in our Technology Solutions segment. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  Income taxes consist of our current and deferred tax expense resulting from our income earned in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. 
  Our effective tax rate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   was   34.9%   and   35.8%  , respectively, compared to   35.2%   and   36.0%   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   changed relative to the prior year periods due to the reversal of certain tax reserves as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitation in certain tax jurisdictions and the mix of income in different geographic regions  . 
  Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to others, which is recognized for the portion of our subsidiaries  equity not owned by us. The change in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the   three   and   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   as compared to the prior year periods was not material to our results of operations.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Cash Flows    
  Our business is working capital intensive. Our working capital needs are primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory. We rely heavily on term loans, accounts receivable arrangements, our securitization program and our revolving lines of credit for our working capital needs. We have financed our growth and cash needs to date primarily through cash generated from operations and financing activities. 
  To increase our market share and better serve our customers, we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions. We expect that such expansion would require an initial investment in working capital, personnel, facilities and operations. These investments or acquisitions would likely be funded primarily by our existing cash and cash equivalents, additional borrowings, or the issuance of securities. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $275.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016  , primarily due to net income of   $149.7 million  , adjustments for non-cash items of   $78.4 million  , a decrease in accounts receivable of   $226.7 million   and an increase in accounts payable of   $70.4 million  . These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in inventories of   $224.8 million  . The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower days sales outstanding in our  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

Technology Solutions segment as of August 31, 2016 compared to November 30, 2015, while the increase in accounts payable and inventories over the same period was due to increased demand for our systems design and integration solutions. The adjustments for non-cash items consist primarily of amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $557.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015  , primarily due to net income of   $146.4 million  , adjustments for non-cash items of   $102.8 million  , a decrease in accounts receivables of   $481.4 million   and a decrease in inventories of   $47.4 million  . These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of   $204.4 million   and an increase in other assets of   $32.0 million  . The decrease in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories was primarily due to lower revenue in our Technology Solutions segment during the three months ended   August 31, 2015   compared to the three months ended November 30, 2014. The increase in other assets was primarily due to higher tax receivables as of   August 31, 2015  . The adjustments for non-cash items consist primarily of amortization, depreciation, unrealized foreign currency exchange losses and stock-based compensation expense. 
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   was   $412.2 million  , primarily due to the payments of   $404.5 million   to acquire Minacs and capital expenditures of   $95.2 million   primarily to support growth in our Concentrix segment. This cash outflow was partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of   $85.9 million   as restrictions on our lockbox collections under our borrowing arrangements were removed during the period. 
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015   was   $63.9 million  , primarily due to our capital expenditures during the period of   $71.5 million   primarily to support growth in our Concentrix segment and a   $30.7 million   increase in restricted cash due to the timing of our lockbox collections under our borrowing arrangements. This cash outflow was offset, in part, by the receipt of   $37.3 million   towards working capital and other post-closing adjustments related to the acquisition of the customer care business of International Business Machines Corporation.  
  Net cash provided by financing activities during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2016   was   $23.0 million  , consisting primarily of   $82.6 million   of net proceeds from our securitization arrangements and revolving lines of credit, partially offset by   $31.9 million   repayments of our term loans, capital leases and other borrowings and   $23.8 million   of dividend payments. 
  Net cash used in financing activities during the   nine   months ended   August 31, 2015   was   $348.2 million  , consisting primarily of   $642.9 million   net repayments of our securitization arrangements and revolving lines of credit and   $88.1 million   decrease in book overdrafts, partially offset by   $408.3 million   of proceeds from an increase in our term loan, net of issuance cost.  
  Capital Resources    
  Our cash and cash equivalents totaled   $223.3 million   and   $336.1 million   as of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , respectively. Of our total cash and cash equivalents, the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was   $178.3 million     and   $146.5 million     as of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , respectively.     Repatriation of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to United States federal income taxes. Also, repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. However, we have historically fully utilized and reinvested all foreign cash to fund our foreign operations and expansion. If in the future our intentions change and we repatriate the cash back to the United States, we will report in our consolidated financial statements the impact of the applicable taxes depending upon the planned timing and manner of such repatriation. Presently, we believe that we have sufficient resources, cash flow and liquidity within the United States to fund current and expected future working capital, investment and other general corporate funding requirements. 
  We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents balances, the cash flows expected to be generated from operations and our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months in all geographies. We also believe that our longer-term working capital, planned capital expenditures, anticipated stock repurchases, dividend payments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
  Historically, we have renewed our accounts receivable securitization program and our U.S. credit facility agreement on, or prior to, their respective expiration dates. We have no reason to believe that these arrangements will not be renewed as we continue to be in good credit standing with the participating financial institutions. We have had similar borrowing arrangements with various financial institutions throughout our years as a public company.

On-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  We have an accounts receivable securitization program, or the U.S. Arrangement, to provide additional capital for our operations in the United States. The U.S. Arrangement has a maturity date of November 4, 2016. One of our subsidiaries, which is the borrower under the U.S. Arrangement, can borrow up to a maximum of $600.0 million based upon eligible trade accounts receivable generated by the parent company and one of our United States subsidiaries. The U.S. Arrangement includes an accordion feature to allow requests for an increase in the lenders' commitment by an additional $100.0 million. The effective borrowing cost under the U.S. Arrangement is a blended rate that includes prevailing dealer commercial paper rates and the daily London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a program fee of   0.375%   per annum based on the used portion of the commitment, and a facility fee of   0.40%   per annum payable on the aggregate commitment of the lenders. As of   August 31, 2016  ,   $91.5 million   was outstanding under the U.S. Arrangement. There were no borrowings outstanding as of   November 30, 2015  . 
  Under the terms of the U.S. Arrangement, we and one of our United States subsidiaries sell, on a revolving basis, their receivables (other than certain specifically excluded receivables) to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. The borrowings are funded by pledging all of the rights, title and interest in and to the receivables acquired by our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary as security. Any borrowings under the U.S. Arrangement are recorded as debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As is customary in trade accounts receivable securitization arrangements like the U.S. Arrangement, where some of the loans are funded through one or more lender s affiliated asset-backed commercial paper programs, a credit rating agency's downgrade of the third party issuer of commercial paper or of a back-up liquidity provider (which provides a source of funding if the commercial paper market cannot be accessed) could result in an increase in our cost of borrowing or loss of our financing capacity under these programs if the commercial paper issuer or liquidity back-up provider is not replaced, or if the lender whose commercial paper issuer or liquidity back-up provider is not replaced does not elect to offer us an alternate rate. Loss of such financing capacity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  In November 2013, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement, or the U.S. Credit Agreement, which was comprised of a   $275.0 million   revolving credit facility and a   $225.0 million   term loan. In May 2015, the U.S. Credit Agreement was amended to increase the term loan to   $625.0 million  . We may request incremental commitments to increase the principal amount of revolving loans or term loans available under the U.S. Credit Agreement up to   $350.0 million  . The U.S. Credit Agreement matures in May 2020. Interest on borrowings under the U.S. Credit Agreement can be based on LIBOR or a base rate at our option. Loans borrowed under the U.S. Credit Agreement bear interest, in the case of LIBOR loans, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable LIBOR, plus a margin which may range from 1.50% to 2.25% , based on our consolidated leverage ratios, as determined in accordance with the U.S. Credit Agreement. Loans borrowed under the U.S. Credit Agreement that are not LIBOR loans, and are instead base rate loans, bear interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) the greatest of (A) the Federal Funds Rate plus a margin of 1/2 of 1.0%, (B) LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum, and (C) the rate of interest announced, from time to time, by the agent, Bank of America, N.A, as its  prime rate,  plus (ii) a margin which may range from 0.50% to 1.25%, based on our consolidated leverage ratios as determined in accordance with the U.S. Credit Agreement. The unused revolving credit facility is subject to a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% per annum, based on our consolidated leverage ratios. The outstanding principal amount of the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments, in an amount equal to (a) for each of the first eight full calendar quarters ending after the U.S. Credit Agreement amendment entered in May 2015, 1.25% of the amended principal amount of the term loan, (b) for each of the next four calendar quarters ending thereafter, 1.875% of the amended principal amount of the term loan, (c) for each calendar quarter ending thereafter, 2.50% of the amended principal amount of the term loan and (d) on the May 2020 maturity date of the term loan, the outstanding principal amount of the term loan. Our obligations under the U.S. Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the parent company s and its United States domestic subsidiaries  assets and are guaranteed by certain of our United States domestic subsidiaries. 
  As of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , balances outstanding under the term loan component of the U.S. Credit Agreement were   $593.8 million   and   $617.2 million  , respectively. There were   no   borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of either   August 31, 2016   or   November 30, 2015  . There was   $1.5 million   outstanding as of both   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , in standby letters of credit under the U.S. Credit Agreement.  
  SYNNEX Canada Limited, or SYNNEX Canada, has a revolving line of credit arrangement with a group of financial institutions, or the Canadian Revolving Arrangement which has a maximum commitment of CAD100.0 million, or   $76.3 million  , and includes an accordion feature to increase the maximum commitment by an additional CAD25.0 million, or   $19.1 million  , to CAD125.0 million, or   $95.4 million  , at SYNNEX Canada's request. SYNNEX Canada has granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets in favor of the lender under the Canadian Revolving Arrangement. In addition, we  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

pledged a portion of our stock in SYNNEX Canada as collateral for the Canadian Revolving Arrangement. The interest rate applicable under the Canadian Revolving Arrangement is equal to (i) the Canadian base rate plus a margin of 0.75% for a Base Rate Loan in Canadian Dollars, (ii) the US base rate plus a margin of 0.75% for a Base Rate Loan in U.S. Dollars, and (iii) the Bankers' Acceptance rate, or BA, plus a margin of 2.00% for a BA Rate Loan. The Canadian base rate means the greater of (a) the prime rate determined by a major Canadian financial institution and (b) the one month Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (the average rate applicable to Canadian Dollar bankers' acceptances for the applicable period) plus 1.50%. The US base rate means the greater of (a) a reference rate determined by a major Canadian financial institution for US dollar loans made to Canadian borrowers and (b) the US federal funds rate plus 0.50%. A fee of 0.25% per annum is payable with respect to the unused portion of the commitment. The credit arrangement expires in May 2017. As of   August 31, 2016  , there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the Canadian Revolving Arrangement, and there was   $9.7 million   outstanding as of   November 30, 2015  . The Canadian Revolving Arrangement also provides a sublimit of   $5.0 million   for the issuance of standby letters of credit. As of both   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , there were   no   letters of credit outstanding.  
  SYNNEX Canada has a term loan associated with the purchase of its logistics facility in Guelph, Canada. The interest rate for the unpaid principal amount is a fixed rate of   5.374%   per annum. The final maturity date for repayment of the unpaid principal is April 1, 2017. The balances outstanding on the term loan as of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015   were   $4.3 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively. 
  SYNNEX Infotec has a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions for a maximum commitment of JPY14.0 billion, or   $135.4 million  . The credit agreement is comprised of a   JPY6.0 billion  , or   $58.0 million  , term loan and a   JPY8.0 billion  , or   $77.3 million  , short-term revolving credit facility. The interest rate for the term loan and revolving credit facility is based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ( TIBOR ) plus a margin of 0.70% per annum. The unused line fee on the revolving credit facility is 0.10% per annum. This credit facility expires in November 2018. As of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , the balances outstanding under the term loan component of the facility were   $58.0 million   and   $48.7 million  , respectively. Balances outstanding under the revolving credit facility were   $37.7 million   and   $47.9 million   as of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , respectively. The term loan can be repaid at any time prior to expiration date without penalty. We have guaranteed the obligations of SYNNEX Infotec under this facility. 
  Our Indian subsidiaries have credit facilities with a financial institution to borrow up to an aggregate amount of $14.0 million. The interest rate under the credit facilities is based on LIBOR plus a margin of 0.90% per annum. The credit facilities can be terminated at any time by our Indian subsidiaries or the financial institution. We guarantee the obligations under these credit facilities. As of   August 31, 2016  ,   $10.0 million   was outstanding. As of   November 30, 2015  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities.  
  We also maintain local currency denominated lines of credit with financial institutions at certain locations outside the United States aggregating   $31.7 million  . As of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , we had   no   borrowings outstanding under these various facilities. 
  As of   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , we recorded   $10.7 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in obligations attributable to SYNNEX Infotec for the sale and financing of this subsidiary's approved accounts receivable and notes receivable with recourse provisions and outstanding capital lease obligations.  
  The maximum commitment amounts for local currency credit facilities have been translated into United States Dollars at   August 31, 2016   exchange rates. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have financing programs in the United States and Japan under which trade accounts receivable of certain customers may be sold, without recourse, to financial institutions. Available capacity under these programs is dependent upon the level of our trade accounts receivable eligible to be sold into these programs and the financial institutions  willingness to purchase such receivables. At   August 31, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , we had a total of   $62.6 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively, of trade accounts receivable sold to and held by the financial institutions under these programs. 
  Covenant Compliance    
  Our borrowing arrangements have a number of covenants and restrictions that, among other things, require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants. These covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

financial condition tests. They also limit our ability to incur additional debt, make intercompany loans, pay dividends and make other types of distributions, make certain acquisitions, repurchase our stock, create liens, cancel debt owed to us, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of our business, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, make certain investments, enter into new real estate leases, transfer and sell assets, cancel or terminate any material contracts and merge or consolidate. As of   August 31, 2016  , we were in compliance with all material covenants for the above arrangements.  
  Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations consist of future payments due under our loans, capital leases and operating lease arrangements. As of   August 31, 2016  , there have been no material changes from our disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   November 30, 2015  . For more information on our future minimum rental obligations under noncancellable lease agreements as of   August 31, 2016  , see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Guarantees 
  We, as the ultimate parent, guaranteed the obligations of SYNNEX Investment Holdings Corporation up to   $35.0 million   in connection with the sale of China Civilink (Cayman), which operated in China as HiChina Web Solutions, to Alibaba.com Limited. The guarantee expires in fiscal year 2018.  
  We are contingently liable under agreements, without expiration dates, to repurchase repossessed inventory acquired by flooring companies as a result of default on floor plan financing arrangements by our customers. There have been no repurchases through   August 31, 2016   under these agreements and we are not aware of any pending customer defaults or repossession obligations. As the Company does not have access to information regarding the amount of inventory purchased from the Company still on hand with the customer at any point in time, the Company s repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We negotiate pricing and other material terms on a case-by-case basis with MiTAC Holdings. We have adopted a policy requiring that material transactions with MiTAC Holdings or its related parties be approved by our Audit Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    
  There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the three months ended   August 31, 2016   from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   November 30, 2015  . For further discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, reference is made to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures  
  (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with management s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
