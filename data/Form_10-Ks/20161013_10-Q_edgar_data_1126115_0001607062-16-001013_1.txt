NOTE
1   CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows as of and for the period ended August 31, 2016 and for all periods presented have been made.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s May 31, 2016
audited financial statements as reported in Form 10-K. The results of operations for the period ended August 31, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ended May 31, 2017.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source
of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has realized net
losses since inception totaling $3,236,286. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company
obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital,
it could be forced to cease operations.  

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan
is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet
its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that
the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.

NOTE
3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable,
disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations
of the Company.  

   Recent
Pronouncement   

  On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders  equity, (2) label the financial statements as those
of a development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
in the development stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim
reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.  The Company has elected to early adopt these
amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented
inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.  

NOTE
4   LOAN PAYABLE   

As
of August 31, 2016, the Company has a loan from a non-related party totaling $44,100 which is unsecured, bears interest at 8 percent,
and is due on demand. Interest expense for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was $820 and $702, respectively.  

NOTE
5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

The
financial statements include related party transactions, which as of August 31, 2016, were loans from an officer of the Company
totaling $23,500 for operating activities. No further loans have been advanced during the period ending August 31, 2016. The loans
are due on June 30, 2018, are not collateralized, and bear interest at 8% per annum. These loans accrued interest of $12,287,
and $11,817, as of August 31, 2016, and May 31, 2016, respectively.

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS   

The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) encourages reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information
so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This report contains these types
of statements. Words such as  may,   intend,   expect,   believe,   anticipate, 
 estimate,   project,  or  continue  or comparable terminology used in connection with any
discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking statements
reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Executive
Overview   

We
have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and lack revenues to cover our operating costs. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from
management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional
funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find
a suitable company and acquire or enter into a merger with such company.  

The
type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for long term. We may consider a business
which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or
markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or
operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading
market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which
may occur through a public offering.  

Our
management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business
combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages
of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject
to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth
companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance
that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.  

Our
management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s
plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one
venture against gains from another.  

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions,
rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there
are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors
in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business
combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

At
August 31, 2016, we had cash of $3,988 and total liabilities of $176,889 compared to cash of $1,562 and total liabilities of $168,499
at May 31, 2016. We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During the three
month period ended August 31, 2016 we borrowed $5,500 from a third party to fund our operations and relied upon a stockholder,
for administrative and professional services totaling $1,600. During the year ended May 31, 2016 we borrowed $5,300 from a third
party to fund our operations and relied upon a stockholder, for administrative and professional services totaling $6,900.  

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to
obtaining capital from management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is
no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent
upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such a company.  

The
type of business opportunity that we acquire or merge with will affect our profitability for the long term. We may consider a
business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products
or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial
or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading
market for its securities, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control
which may occur through a public offering.  

During
the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports, and possibly investigating, analyzing
and consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant
stockholders and third parties.  

Results
of Operations    

We
did not record revenues in 2016 or 2015. General and administrative expenses decreased to $4,674 for the three month period ended
August 31, 2016 ( 2017 first quarter ) compared to $5,675 for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 ( 2016
first quarter ). General and administrative expenses represented consulting, administrative, professional services and out
of pocket costs and the 2016 decrease is primarily due to reduced consulting and administrative fees.  

Total
other expense increased to $1,290 for the 2017 first quarter compared to $1,172 for the 2016 first quarter as a result of accrued
interest on loans.  

Our
net loss decreased to $5,964 for the 2017 first quarter compared to $6,847 for the 2016 first quarter. Management expects net
losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.  

Obligations    

We
have relied upon loans and advances to fund our operational expenses. During the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2010, our Director
and President, Greg L. Popp, loaned an aggregate of $23,500 to the Company. On April 20, 2010, these loans were combined into
one promissory note which carries interest at 8%, is not collateralized and matured in June 2012. In June 2016, Mr. Popp extended
the due date of this loan from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2018. These loans accrued interest of $12,287 as of August 31, 2016.  

During
the 2017 first quarter we borrowed $5,500 from a third party for operating expenses. At August 31, 2016 we owe the third party
$44,100 and interest expense for this loan was $3,695. These loans are payable upon demand, are not collateralized and bear interest
at 8% per annum.  

During
the 2017 first quarter First Equity Holdings, Corp. ( First Equity ), a 20% stockholder, provided consulting, administrative
and professional services and provided to, or paid on behalf of the Company, out-of-pocket costs. First Equity billed the Company
$1,600 for its services and advances for the 2017 first quarter. As of August 31, 2016 First Equity s account payable totals
$87,700.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

We
qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the recently enacted JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and
intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other
things, we will not be required to:  

Have
                                         an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section
                                         404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;    

Submit
                                         certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay 
                                         and  say-on-frequency     

Obtain
                                         shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and    

Disclose
                                         certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive
                                         compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to
                                         median employee compensation.    

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated
filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our
ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding
three-year period.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management
to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During
the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information.
Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another
company.  

Changes
to Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined
that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

have limited assets and have had no revenues since inception. We will not receive revenues until we complete an acquisition, reorganization
or merger. We can provide no assurance that any selected or acquired business will produce any material revenues for the Company
or our stockholders, or that any such business will operate on a profitable basis.  

We
will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until we complete a business combination
with a private company. This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase unless we consummate a business
combination with a profitable business. We cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business opportunity and consummate
a business combination, or that any such business will be profitable at the time of its acquisition by the Company, or ever become
profitable.  

There
is currently no trading market for our common stock, and liquidity of shares of our common stock is limited.    

Shares
of our common stock are not registered under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction and are not quoted on any
OTC market. Accordingly, there is no public trading market for the common stock. Further, no public trading market is expected
to develop in the short term. Therefore, outstanding shares of our common stock cannot be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the  Securities Act ) and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. Stockholders may
rely on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 of the Securities Act ( Rule 144 ), subject to certain
restrictions; namely, common stock may not be sold until one year after:  

(i)
the completion of a business combination with a private company after which the Company would cease to be a  shell company 
(as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act); and  

(ii)
the disclosure of certain information on a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the business combination, and
only if the Company has been current in all of its periodic SEC filings for the 12 months preceding the contemplated sale of stock.  

Compliance
with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely
complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions for the securities
received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities
laws.
