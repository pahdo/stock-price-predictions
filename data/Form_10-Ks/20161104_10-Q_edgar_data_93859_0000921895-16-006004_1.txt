Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  

Description of Business   

 The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Biglari Holdings Inc. ( Biglari Holdings  or the  Company ) have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) applicable to
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In our opinion, all adjustments considered
necessary to present fairly the results of the interim periods have been included and consist only of normal recurring adjustments.
The results for the interim periods shown are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire fiscal year. The financial statements
contained herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Biglari Holdings is a holding company
owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including media, property and casualty insurance, and restaurants.
The Company s largest operating subsidiaries are involved in the franchising and operating of restaurants. Biglari Holdings
is founded and led by Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Holdings and its major operating subsidiaries.
The Company s long-term objective is to maximize per-share intrinsic value. All major operating, investment, and capital
allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. 

Principles of Consolidation   

 The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries including Steak n Shake Inc. ( Steak n Shake ),
Western Sizzlin Corporation ( Western ), Maxim Inc. ( Maxim ) and First Guard Insurance Company and its
agency, 1st Guard Corporation (collectively  First Guard ).  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 

Note 2. New Accounting Standards  

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-17,  Interests Held through
Related Parties That Are under Common Control.  ASU 2016-17 amends the consolidation guidance in ASU 2015-02 regarding the treatment
of indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control. We are currently assessing the impact of ASU
2016-17, effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The objective of
the update is to reduce diversity in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in
this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . Topic 326
amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For
available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP; however Topic 326 will
require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. The amendments in this update are effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  The objective of the update
is to improve financial reporting by increasing transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets
and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. It is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the amendments
is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this amended guidance will have on its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

Index   

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities,
along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The amendments in this
update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have a material
effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs . The update requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The
recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The
amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the Company
reclassified $688 from other current assets  to current portion of notes payable and other borrowings. The Company also
reclassified $2,888 from other assets  to other borrowings and long-term notes payable
 to conform to the current year classification. 

In February
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidations Analysis . The amendments in this update provide guidance
under GAAP about limited partnerships, which will be variable interest entities, unless the limited partners have either substantive
kick-out rights or participation rights. It also changes the effect that fees paid to a decision maker or service provider have
on the consolidation analysis and amends how variable interests held by related parties affect the consolidation conclusion. The
amendments in this update are effective for the annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2015. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this update has no material
effect on the Company s financial statements. 

In August 2014,
the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern . The amendments in this update provide guidance
in GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue
as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing
and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update are effective for the annual periods ending after December 15,
2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect,
if any, on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that
requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the
consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about
the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In July 2015, the FASB voted
to defer the effective date of this ASU by one year, which would make the guidance effective for our first quarter fiscal year
2018 financial statements using either of two acceptable adoption methods: (i) retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period
presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying
the guidance recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures. We currently expect to
adopt ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method where the cumulative effect is recognized at the
date of initial application. Our evaluation of ASU 2014-09 is ongoing and not complete. The FASB has issued and may issue in the
future, interpretative guidance, which may cause our evaluation to change. While we anticipate some changes to revenue recognition
for certain transactions, we do not currently believe ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3. Earnings Per Share  

Earnings per share of common stock is
based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The shares of Company stock attributable to our limited
partner interest in The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P.   based on our proportional ownership during this period
  are considered treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet and thereby deemed not to be included in the calculation
of weighted average common shares outstanding. However, these shares are legally outstanding. 

From December 18, 2014 to September
30, 2016, The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P. (collectively, the  investment partnerships ) purchased an
aggregate of 716,237 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans and a tender offer, of which
37,925 shares were purchased during the first nine months of 2016. All of the shares purchased by the investment partnerships remain
legally outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, Mr. Biglari s beneficial ownership of the Company s outstanding common
stock was approximately 51.3%. 

Index   

Note 3. Earnings Per Share   (continued)  

The following table presents a reconciliation
of basic and diluted weighted average common shares. 

The Company s common stock is $0.50 stated value. The
following table presents shares authorized, issued and outstanding. 

Note 4. Investments 

Investments consisted of the following. 

Investment gains/losses are recognized
when investments are sold (as determined on a specific identification basis) or as otherwise required by GAAP. The timing of realized
gains and losses from sales can have a material effect on periodic earnings. However, such realized gains or losses usually have
little, if any, impact on total shareholders  equity because the investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized
gains/losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders  equity.  We believe
that realized investment gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding reported results. Short-term investment gains/losses
have caused and may continue to cause volatility in our results. 

Investments in equity securities and
a related put option of $4,464 are included in other assets and recorded at fair value. 

Index   

Note 5.  Investment Partnerships  

The Company reports on the limited partnership
interests in investment partnerships under the equity method of accounting.  We record our proportional share of equity in
the investment partnerships but exclude Company common stock held by said partnerships.  The Company s pro-rata share
of its common stock held by the investment partnerships is recorded as treasury stock even though they are legally outstanding. 
The Company records gains/losses from investment partnerships (inclusive of the investment partnerships  unrealized gains
and losses on their securities) in the consolidated statements of earnings based on our carrying value of these partnerships.  The
fair value is calculated net of the general partner s accrued incentive fees. Gains and losses on Company common stock included
in the earnings of these partnerships are eliminated because they are recorded as treasury stock.  

The fair value and adjustment for Company
common stock held by the investment partnerships to determine carrying value of our partnership interest is presented below. 

The fair value of the investment partnerships
net of deferred taxes is presented below. 

The Company s proportionate share
of Company stock held by investment partnerships at cost is $352,634 and $332,827 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, and is recorded as treasury stock. 

The carrying value of the partnership
interest approximates fair value adjusted by changes in the value of held Company stock. Fair value is according to our proportional
ownership interest of the fair value of investments held by the investment partnerships. The fair value measurement is classified
as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 

Index   

Note 5.  Investment Partnerships   (continued)  

Gains from investment partnerships recorded in the Company s
consolidated statements of earnings are presented below. 

Non-cash investments were $1,219 (net
of non-cash distributions) for the first nine months of 2016. 

As the general partner of the investment
partnerships, Biglari Capital Corp. ( Biglari Capital ) on December 31 of each year will earn an incentive reallocation
fee for the Company s investments equal to 25% of the net profits over an annual hurdle rate of 6% above the previous high-water
mark. Our policy is to accrue an estimated incentive fee throughout the year; however, no fees are reallocated until the end
of the calendar year. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company accrued incentive fees for Biglari Capital of $191 and $413,
respectively. Our investments in these partnerships are committed on a rolling 5-year basis. Mr. Biglari is the sole owner of Biglari
Capital. 

Summarized financial information for
The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P. is presented below. 

Revenue in the above summarized financial
information of the investment partnerships includes investment income and unrealized gains and losses on investments. The investments
held by the investment partnerships are largely concentrated in the common stock of one investee, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,
Inc. 

Index   

Note 6. Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment is composed of
the following. 

Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangibles 

Goodwill   

 Goodwill consists of the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions. 

A reconciliation of the change in the
carrying value of goodwill is as follows. 

We are required to assess goodwill and
any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have
occurred. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-step approach. The first is the estimation of fair value
of each reporting unit. If step one indicates that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the amount
of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. 

The valuation methodology and underlying
financial information included in our determination of fair value require significant management judgments. We use both market
and income approaches to derive fair value. The judgments in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, comparable market
multiples, long-term projections of future financial performance, and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine
the present value of future cash flows. Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly
different results. No impairment charges for goodwill were recorded in the first nine months of 2016 or 2015. 

Other Intangibles   

 Other intangibles are composed of the
following. 

Index   

Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangibles
  (continued)  

Intangible assets subject to amortization
consist of franchise agreements connected with the purchase of Western as well as rights to favorable leases related to prior acquisitions.
These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated weighted average of useful lives ranging from eight to twelve
years. 

Amortization expense for the first nine
months of 2016 and 2015 was $428 and $431, respectively. Total annual amortization expense for years 2017 through 2019 will approximate
$559 per year. The Company s intangible assets with definite lives will fully amortize in 2020. 

Intangible assets with indefinite lives
consist of trade names, franchise rights as well as lease rights. 

Note 8. Restaurant Operations Revenues  

Restaurant operations revenues were
as follows. 

Note 9. Borrowings  

Notes payable and other borrowings include the following. 

ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs
to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. As of December 31, 2015,
the Company reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs from other assets to notes payable and other borrowings. 

Steak n Shake Credit Facility   

 On March 19, 2014, Steak n Shake and
its subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement. This credit agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in
an aggregate principal amount of $220,000 and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $30,000. 

The term loan is scheduled to mature
on March 19, 2021. It amortizes at an annual rate of 1.0% in equal quarterly installments, beginning June 30, 2014, at 0.25% of
the original principal amount of the term loan, subject to mandatory prepayments from excess cash flow, asset sales and other events
described in the credit agreement. The balance will be due at maturity. The revolver will be available on a revolving basis until
March 19, 2019. 

Index   

Note 9. Borrowings   (continued)  

Steak n Shake has the right to request
an incremental term loan facility from participating lenders and/or eligible assignees at any time, up to an aggregate total principal
amount not to exceed $70,000 if certain customary conditions within the credit agreement are met. 

Borrowings bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to a base rate or a Eurodollar rate (minimum of 1%) plus an applicable margin. Interest on the term loan is based on
a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 3.75% or on the prime rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75%. Interest on loans
under the revolver is based on a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.75% to 4.25% or on the prime rate plus
an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.25%. The applicable margins on revolver loans are contingent on Steak n Shake s
total leverage ratio. The revolver also carries a commitment fee ranging from 0.40% to 0.50% per annum, depending on Steak n Shake s
total leverage ratio, on the unused portion of the revolver. 

The interest rate on the term loan was
4.75% as of September 30, 2016. 

The credit agreement includes customary
affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, as well as a financial maintenance covenant, solely with respect to the
revolver, relating to the maximum total leverage ratio. Steak n Shake s credit facility contains restrictions on its ability
to pay dividends to Biglari Holdings. 

Both the term loan and the revolver
have been secured by first priority security interests in substantially all the assets of Steak n Shake. Biglari Holdings is not
a guarantor under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, $203,648 was outstanding under the term loan, and no amount was
outstanding under the revolver. 

Steak n Shake had $10,188 in standby
letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Western Revolver   

 As of September 30, 2016, Western has
$432 due December 13, 2016. 

Fair Value of Debt   

 The carrying amounts for debt reported
in the consolidated balance sheet did not differ materially from their fair values at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
The fair value was determined to be a Level 3 fair value measurement.

Note 11. Income Taxes 

In determining the quarterly provision
for income taxes, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates,
and available tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Unusual or infrequently occurring
items are separately recognized during the quarter in which they occur. 

Income tax for the third quarter of
2016 was a benefit of $44,129 compared to a benefit of $248 for the third quarter of 2015.  Income tax expense for the
first nine months of 2016 was $5,011 compared to $4,739 for the first nine months of 2015. The variance in income taxes between
the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 is primarily attributable to taxes on income and losses from investment partnerships. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, we had approximately $366 and $413, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in other liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Index   

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies 

We are involved in various legal proceedings
and have certain unresolved claims pending. We believe, based on examination of these matters and experiences to date, that the
ultimate liability, if any, in excess of amounts already provided in our consolidated financial statements is not likely to have
a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In 2013 two shareholders of the
Company filed derivative actions putatively on behalf of the Company against the members of our Board of Directors in the United
States District Courts for the Southern District of Indiana and the Western District of Texas.  The actions were consolidated
in the Southern District of Indiana in 2014.  On March 18, 2015, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Indiana granted a motion to dismiss the derivative actions in favor of the Company.  In addition, the Court issued judgment
on all counts in favor of the Company and its directors.  

 The two shareholders appealed the Southern
District of Indiana Court s March 18, 2015 decision. On February 17, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit affirmed the decision of the District Court dismissing, in their entirety, all claims made against the Company and its
Board of Directors. 

Note 13. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 

The fair values of substantially all
of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting
market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the fair values presented are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts that could be realized in an actual current market exchange. The use of alternative market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels
1 through 3, which are described below. 

Level 1   Inputs represent unadjusted
quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.     

Level 2   Inputs include directly
or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in
active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that
may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities,
prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated
by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash
flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations
and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.     

Level 3   Inputs include unobservable
inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable
inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and we may be unable to corroborate the related
observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that
would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities.     

The following methods and assumptions
were used to determine the fair value of each class of the following assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated
balance sheet: 

Cash equivalents:  Cash equivalents
primarily consist of money market funds which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Equity securities:  The Company s
investments in equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Bonds:  The Company s investments
in bonds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Non-qualified deferred compensation
plan investments:  The assets of the non-qualified plan are set up in a rabbi trust. They represent mutual funds and are classified
within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Derivative instruments:  Options
related to equity securities and interest rate swaps are marked to market each reporting period and are classified within Level
2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Index   

Note 13. Fair Value of Financial
Assets and Liabilities   (continued)  

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities were as follows. 

There were no changes in our valuation
techniques used to measure fair values on a recurring basis. 

Note 14. Related Party Transactions  

In 2013 Biglari Holdings entered into
the following agreements with Mr. Biglari, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: (i) a Stock Purchase Agreement for the sale
of Biglari Capital to Mr. Biglari (the  Biglari Capital Transaction ); (ii) a Shared Services Agreement with Biglari
Capital, and (iii) a First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Incentive Agreement with Mr. Biglari (the  Incentive Agreement
Amendment ). The transactions contemplated thereby were unanimously approved by the independent Governance, Compensation
and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Committee ), which retained separate counsel,
tax/accounting advisors, an independent compensation consultant, and a financial advisor to assist the Committee in the structuring,
evaluation, and negotiation of such transactions. Mr. Biglari is the sole owner of Biglari Capital. 

Shared Services Agreement   

 Connected with the Biglari Capital
Transaction, Biglari Holdings and Biglari Capital entered into the Shared Services Agreement pursuant to which Biglari Holdings
provides certain services to Biglari Capital in exchange for a 6% hurdle rate for Biglari Holdings and its subsidiaries (as compared
to a 5% hurdle rate for all other limited partners) in order to determine the incentive reallocation to Biglari Capital, as general
partner of The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P., under their respective partnership agreements. The incentive reallocation
to Biglari Capital is equal to 25% of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of their applicable hurdle rate
above the previous high-water mark. The Shared Services Agreement runs for an initial five-year term, and automatically renews
for successive five-year periods, unless terminated by either party effective at the end of the initial or the renewed term, as
applicable. The term of the Shared Services Agreement coincides with the lock-up period for the Company s investments in
The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P. under their respective partnership agreements. The Company provided services for
Biglari Capital under the Shared Services Agreement costing an aggregate of $494 for the third quarter of 2016 and $152 for the
third quarter of 2015, and $1,145 for the first nine months of 2016 and $3,943 for the first nine months of 2015.  

Investments in The Lion Fund,
L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P.   
As of September 30, 2016, the Company s investments in The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P. had a fair value of
$837,860. 

Index   

Note 14. Related Party Transactions
  (continued)  

As the general partner of the investment
partnerships, Biglari Capital on December 31 of each year will earn an incentive reallocation fee for the Company s investments
equal to 25% of the net profits over an annual hurdle rate of 6% above the previous high-water mark. Our policy is to accrue
an estimated incentive fee throughout the year; however, no fees are reallocated until the end of the calendar year. The Company
accrued $191 and $413 in incentive fees for Biglari Capital during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Incentive Agreement Amendment   

Also in connection with the Biglari
Capital Transaction, Biglari Holdings and Mr. Biglari entered into the Incentive Agreement Amendment which amends the Amended and
Restated Incentive Agreement with Mr. Biglari to reflect and give effect to the Biglari Capital Transaction, which excludes earnings
by the investment partnerships from the calculation of Mr. Biglari s incentive bonus. 

Under the Amended and Restated Incentive
Agreement Mr. Biglari would receive a payment of approximately $17,000 if an event occurred entitling him to a severance payment. 

License Agreement   

 In 2013 the Company entered into a Trademark
License Agreement (the  License Agreement ) with Mr. Biglari. The License Agreement was unanimously approved by the
Committee. In addition, the license under the License Agreement is provided on a royalty-free basis in the absence of specified
extraordinary events described below. Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries have paid no royalties to Mr. Biglari under
the License Agreement since its inception. 

Under the License Agreement, Mr. Biglari
granted to the Company an exclusive license to use the Biglari and Biglari Holdings names (the  Licensed Marks ) in
association with various products and services (collectively the  Products and Services ). Upon (a) the expiration
of twenty years from the date of the License Agreement (subject to extension as provided in the License Agreement), (b) Mr. Biglari s
death, (c) the termination of Mr. Biglari s employment by the Company for Cause (as defined in the License Agreement), or
(d) Mr. Biglari s resignation from his employment with the Company absent an Involuntary Termination Event (as defined in
the License Agreement), the Licensed Marks for the Products and Services will transfer from Mr. Biglari to the Company, without
any compensation, if the Company is continuing to use the Licensed Marks in the ordinary course of its business. Otherwise, the
rights will revert to Mr. Biglari. 

If (i) a Change of Control (as defined
in the License Agreement) of the Company; (ii) the termination of Mr. Biglari s employment by the Company without Cause;
or (iii) Mr. Biglari s resignation from his employment with the Company due to an Involuntary Termination Event (each, a
 Triggering Event ) were to occur, Mr. Biglari would be entitled to receive a 2.5% royalty on  Revenues 
with respect to the  Royalty Period.  The royalty payment to Mr. Biglari would not apply to all revenues received by
Biglari Holdings and its subsidiaries nor would it apply retrospectively ( i.e. , to revenues received with respect to the
period prior to the Triggering Event). The royalty would apply to revenues recorded by the Company on an accrual basis under GAAP,
solely with respect to the defined period of time after the Triggering Event equal to the Royalty Period, from a covered Product,
Service or business that (1) has used the Biglari Holdings or Biglari name at any time during the term of the License Agreement,
whether prior to or after a Triggering Event, or (2) the Company has specifically identified, prior to a Triggering Event, will
use the name Biglari or Biglari Holdings. 

Revenues  means all revenues
received, on an accrual basis under GAAP, by the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates from the following: (1) all Products
and Services covered by the License Agreement bearing or associated with the names Biglari and Biglari Holdings at any time (whether
prior to or after a Triggering Event). This category would include, without limitation, the use of Biglari or Biglari Holdings
in the public name of a business providing any covered Product or Service; and (2) all covered Products, Services and businesses
that the Company has specifically identified, prior to a Triggering Event, will bear, use or be associated with the name Biglari
or Biglari Holdings. 

The Committee unanimously approved the
association of the Biglari name and mark with all of Steak n Shake s restaurants (including Company operated and franchised
locations), products and brands. On May 14, 2013, the Company, Steak n Shake, LLC and Steak n Shake Enterprises, Inc. entered into
a Trademark Sublicense Agreement in connection therewith. Accordingly, revenues received by the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates
from Steak n Shake s restaurants, products and brands would come within the definition of Revenues for purposes of the License
Agreement. 

Index   

Note 14. Related Party Transactions
  (continued)  

The  Royalty Period  is
a defined period of time, after the Triggering Event, calculated as follows: (i) if, following three months after a Triggering
Event, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates continues to use the Biglari or Biglari Holdings name in connection
with any covered product or service, or continues to use Biglari as part of its corporate or public company name, then the  Royalty
Period  will equal (a) the period of time during which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates continues any
such use, plus (b) a period of time after the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates have ceased all uses of the names Biglari
and Biglari Holdings equal to the length of the term of the License Agreement prior to the Triggering Event, plus three years.
As an example, if a Triggering Event occurs five years after the date of the License Agreement, and the Company ceases all uses
of the Biglari and Biglari Holdings names two years after the Triggering Event, the Royalty Period will equal a total of ten years
(the sum of two years after the Triggering Event during which the Biglari and Biglari Holdings names are being used, plus a period
of time equal to the five years prior to the Triggering Event, plus three years); or (ii) if the Company, its subsidiaries and
affiliates cease all uses of the Biglari and Biglari Holdings names within three months after a Triggering Event, then the  Royalty
Period  will equal the length of the term of the License Agreement prior to the Triggering Event, plus three years. As an
example, if a Triggering Event occurs five years after the date of the License Agreement, and the Company ceases all uses of the
Biglari and Biglari Holdings names two months after the Triggering Event, the Royalty Period will equal a total of eight years
(the sum of the period of time equal to the five years prior to the Triggering Event, plus three years). Notwithstanding the above
methods of determining the Royalty Period, the minimum Royalty Period is five years after a Triggering Event. 

The Company and its subsidiaries have
paid no royalties to Mr. Biglari under the License Agreement since its execution. 

The actual amount of royalties paid
to Mr. Biglari following the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as defined in the License Agreement) would depend on the Company s
revenues during the applicable period following the Triggering Event, and, therefore, depends on material assumptions and estimates
regarding future operations and revenues. Assuming for purposes of illustration a Triggering Event occurred on December 31, 2015,
using revenue from fiscal year 2015 as an estimate of future revenue and calculated according to terms of the License Agreement,
Mr. Biglari would receive approximately $20,500 in royalty payments annually. At a minimum, the royalties would be earned on revenue
generated from January 1, 2016 through December 19, 2021. Royalty payments beyond the minimum period would be subject to the licensee's
continued use of the licensed marks. 

Note 15. Business Segment Reporting  

Our reportable business segments are
organized in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. 

Our restaurant operations includes Steak
n Shake and Western. As a result of the acquisitions of First Guard and Maxim, the Company reports segment information for these
businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, other business activities not specifically identified with reportable business
segments were presented in corporate expenses. Such other business activities are now presented in  other  within
total operating businesses. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. We report our earnings
from investment partnerships separate from our corporate expenses. 

We assess and measure segment operating
results based on segment earnings as disclosed below. Segment earnings from operations are neither necessarily indicative of cash
available to fund cash requirements, nor synonymous with cash flow from operations.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

(dollars in thousands except per share data)  

Overview  

Biglari Holdings Inc. ( Biglari
Holdings  or the  Company ) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business
activities, including media, property and casualty insurance, and restaurants. The Company s largest operating subsidiaries
are involved in the franchising and operating of restaurants. Biglari Holdings is founded and led by Sardar Biglari, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Holdings and its major operating subsidiaries. The Company s long-term objective is to
maximize per-share intrinsic value. All major operating, investment, and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company
and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. 

The Lion Fund II, L.P., a private investment
partnership of which Mr. Biglari controls the general partner, purchased 37,925 shares of Biglari Holdings common stock from January
4, 2016 through September 30, 2016 pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. As of September 30, 2016, Mr. Biglari s beneficial
ownership of the Company s outstanding common stock was approximately 51.3%. 

Net earnings (loss) attributable to
Biglari Holdings shareholders for the third quarters and first nine months of 2016 and 2015 are disaggregated in the table that
follows. Amounts are recorded after deducting income taxes. 

Our restaurant businesses include Steak
n Shake Inc. ( Steak n Shake ) and Western Sizzlin Corporation ( Western ). As of September 30, 2016, Steak
n Shake comprised 417 company-operated restaurants and 166 franchised units. Western comprised 3 company-operated restaurants and
64 franchised units. 

Our insurance business is composed of
First Guard Insurance Company and its agency, 1st Guard Corporation (collectively  First Guard ), which we acquired
on March 19, 2014. First Guard is a direct underwriter of commercial trucking insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking
liability insurance to truckers. 

Our media business is composed of Maxim
Inc. ( Maxim ). We acquired certain assets and liabilities of Maxim on February 27, 2014. Maxim s business lies
principally in media and licensing.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (continued)  

Restaurants  

Steak n Shake and Western comprise 650
company-operated and franchised restaurants as of September 30, 2016. 

Earnings of our restaurant operations
are summarized below. 

(1)    Cost of food, restaurant operating costs and rent expense are
                                         expressed as a percentage of net sales.    

(2)    General and administrative, marketing, other expenses and depreciation
                                         and amortization are expressed as a percentage of total revenue.    

Index   

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (continued)  

Net sales during the third quarter
and the first nine months of 2016 were $203,701 and $603,850, respectively, representing an increase of $198 over the third
quarter and $1,899 over the first nine months of 2015. Steak n Shake s same-store sales increased 0.2% whereas customer
traffic decreased 0.2% during the third quarter. Steak n Shake s same store sales increased 0.4% whereas customer
traffic decreased 0.8% during the first nine months. The term  same-store sales  refers to the sales of
company-operated units open at least 18 months at the beginning of the current period and have remained open through the end
of the period. 

Franchise royalties and fees
during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 increased 23.5% and 16.6%, respectively,  compared to those in 2015.  Steak n
Shake opened thirteen franchise units and closed one franchise unit during the third quarter of 2016. Western closed one
franchise unit during the third quarter of 2016. The increase in sales during 2016 is primarily attributable to the
revenue from Steak n Shake units opened during 2016 and 2015.  

Cost of food in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2016 was $57,409 or 28.2% of net sales and $167,968 or 27.8% of net sales compared to the third quarter and
first nine months in 2015 of $59,353 or 29.2% of net sales and $176,207 or 29.3% of net sales. The decrease as a percent of net
sales during 2016 was primarily attributable to lower beef costs. 

Restaurant operating costs during the
third quarter of 2016 were $100,199 or 49.2% of net sales compared to $96,498 or 47.4% of net sales in 2015. Restaurant operating
costs during the first nine months of 2016 were $297,145 or 49.2% of net sales compared to $284,710 or 47.3% of net sales in 2015.
Costs as a percent of net sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 increased principally due to higher
wages and benefits. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 were $28,415 or 13.6% of total revenues and $85,095 or 13.7% of
total revenues, respectively. The expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 were $28,624 or 13.7% of total revenues and $85,025
or 13.8% of total revenues, respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased by $1,926 and $5,734 during the third quarter and first
nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to decreased personnel expenses. Marketing increased by
$1,787 and $4,377 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods during 2015. Marketing expense
increased primarily due to an increase in promotional advertising during the first and third quarters of 2016.

Insurance  

First Guard is a direct underwriter
of commercial trucking insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking liability insurance to truckers. Earnings of our insurance
business are summarized below. 

First Guard s insurance products are marketed primarily
through direct response methods via the Internet or by telephone.  First Guard s cost-efficient direct response marketing
methods enable it to be a low-cost trucking insurer. 

Pre-tax underwriting gain was $1,046 and $4,211 in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2016. The increase in pre-tax underwriting gain for the first nine months was mainly based on
higher premiums written.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (continued)  

Media  

Maxim s business lies principally
in media and licensing. Earnings of our media operations are summarized below. 

We acquired Maxim with the idea of transforming
the brand. We have been rebuilding Maxim s media business, both in print and in digital, as well as developing a licensing
business. We have been making adjustments in operations to reduce dramatically the high fixed costs inherent in the media business.
The magazine developed the Maxim brand, a franchise we are utilizing to build cash-generating businesses, namely licensing royalties
related to consumer products, services, and events. Management expects to become profitable towards the end of the fourth quarter,
2016. 

We have taken the risk on the belief
that the probability for gain in value more than justifies the risk of loss.  

Investment Partnership Gains (Losses)  

Earnings (loss) from our investments
in partnerships are summarized below. 

The Company recorded after-tax losses
from investment partnerships of $64,231 during the third quarter of 2016 and after-tax gains of $6,990 during the third quarter
of 2015. During the first nine months of 2016 the Company recorded after-tax gains from investment partnerships of $19,229 compared
to $19,547 for the first nine months of 2015. The volatility of the gains and losses during the various periods is attributable
to changes in market values of investments held by the investment partnerships. 

Certain of the investment partnerships
hold the Company s common stock as investments. The Company s pro-rata share of its common stock held by the investment
partnerships is recorded as treasury stock even though these shares are legally outstanding. Gains and losses on Company common
stock included in the earnings of these partnerships are eliminated.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (continued)  

Interest Expense  

The Company s interest expense
is summarized below. 

Interest expense during the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016 was $2,831 and $8,626, respectively. The expense in 2016 remained relatively flat compared to the third quarter
and first nine months of 2015 which were $2,966 and $8,969, respectively. The outstanding balance under Steak n Shake s credit facility
on September 30, 2016 was $203,648 with a 4.75% interest rate. 

Corporate  

Corporate expenses exclude the activities
in the restaurant, insurance, media and other companies. Corporate expenses, net of tax, during the third quarter
of 2016 of $1,007 remained relatively constant  compared to net expenses of $1,194 during the third quarter
of 2015. During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 corporate expenses, net of tax, were $4,376 and $7,577, respectively. The decrease
in expenses during 2016 was primarily attributable to lower legal expenses. 

Income Tax Expense  

Income tax for the third quarter of
2016 was a benefit of $44,129 compared to a benefit of $248 for the third quarter of 2015.  Income tax expense for the
first nine months of 2016 was $5,011 compared to $4,739 for the first nine months of 2015. The variance in income taxes between
the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 is primarily attributable to taxes on income and losses from investment partnerships. 

Financial Condition  

Our balance sheet continues to maintain
significant liquidity. Our consolidated shareholders  equity on September 30, 2016 was $460,879 compared to $451,372 on December
31, 2015. Shareholders  equity increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily because of net earnings
of $28,551. The increase from net earnings was offset by an increase in treasury stock of $19,797 attributable primarily to purchases
of Biglari Holdings common stock by The Lion Fund II, L.P. 

Consolidated cash and investments are
summarized below. 

Liquidity   

Cash provided by operating activities
during the first nine months of 2016 was $55,956 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $34,581 during 2015. The
increase was primarily a result of an increase of distributions from the investment partnerships of $11,265 and an increase in
net earnings adjusted for non-cash items of $6,709. 

Index   

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (continued)  

Net cash used in investing activities
during the first nine months of 2016 of $23,860 primarily consisted of investments in investment partnerships of $14,150 and capital
expenditures of $6,795. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2015 of $107,611 was primarily because
of investments in investment partnerships of $88,500, purchases of bonds (net of maturities) of $10,828 and capital expenditures
of $8,416. 

Net cash used in financing activities
was $13,245 during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to $6,219 during 2015. The increase in cash used in financing activities
is primarily due to an additional $7,077 payment of long-term debt made during the first nine months of 2016. 

We intend to meet the working capital
needs of our operating subsidiaries principally through anticipated cash flows generated from operations, cash on hand, existing
credit facilities, and the sale of excess properties and investments. We continually review available financing alternatives. 

Steak n Shake Credit Facility  

 On March 19, 2014, Steak n Shake and
its subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement. This credit agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in
an aggregate principal amount of $220,000 and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $30,000. 

The term loan is scheduled to mature
on March 19, 2021. It amortizes at an annual rate of 1.0% in equal quarterly installments, beginning June 30, 2014, at 0.25% of
the original principal amount of the term loan, subject to mandatory prepayments from excess cash flow, asset sales and other events
described in the credit agreement. The balance will be due at maturity. The revolver will be available on a revolving basis until
March 19, 2019. 

Steak n Shake has the right to request
an incremental term loan facility from participating lenders and/or eligible assignees at any time, up to an aggregate total principal
amount not to exceed $70,000 if certain customary conditions within the credit agreement are met. 

Borrowings bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to a base rate or a Eurodollar rate (minimum of 1%) plus an applicable margin. Interest on the term loan is based on
a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 3.75% or on the prime rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75%. Interest on loans
under the revolver is based on a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.75% to 4.25% or on the prime rate plus
an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.25%. The applicable margins on revolver loans are contingent on Steak n Shake s
total leverage ratio. The revolver also carries a commitment fee ranging from 0.40% to 0.50% per annum, according to Steak n Shake s
total leverage ratio, on the unused portion of the revolver. 

As of September 30, 2016, the interest
rate on the term loan was 4.75%. 

The credit agreement includes customary
affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, as well as a financial maintenance covenant, solely with respect to the
revolver, relating to the maximum total leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants. Steak
n Shake s credit facility contains restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to Biglari Holdings. 

Both the term loan and the revolver
have been secured by first priority security interests on substantially all the assets of Steak n Shake. Biglari Holdings is not
a guarantor under the credit facility. At September 30, 2016, $203,648 was outstanding under the term loan, and no amount is outstanding
under the revolver. 

Steak n Shake had $10,188 in standby
letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Western Revolver  

 As of September 30, 2016, Western has
$432 due December 13, 2016.

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (continued)  

Critical Accounting Policies   

 Management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain accounting policies require management
to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in
our consolidated financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially
significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements
will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. There have been no material changes
to critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Effects of Governmental Regulations
and Inflation   

 Most Restaurant operations employees
are paid hourly rates related to minimum wage laws. Any increase in the legal minimum wage would directly increase our operating
costs. We are also subject to various laws related to zoning, land use, health and safety standards, working conditions, and accessibility
standards. Any changes in these laws that require improvements to our restaurants would increase our operating costs. 

Inflation in food, labor, fringe benefits,
energy costs, transportation costs and other operating costs directly affect our operations. 

The federal healthcare reform legislation
that became law in March 2010 (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [ PPACA ]) mandates menu labeling
of certain nutritional aspects of restaurant menu items such as caloric, sugar, sodium, and fat content. Altering our recipes in
response to such legislation could increase our costs and/or change the flavor profile of our menu offerings, which could have
an adverse impact on our results of operations. Additionally, if our customers perceive our menu items to contain unhealthy caloric,
sugar, sodium, or fat content, our results of operations could be further adversely affected. 

Additionally, minimum employee health
care coverage mandated by state or federal legislation, such as the PPACA, could significantly increase our employee health benefit
costs or require us to alter the benefits we provide to our employees. While we are assessing the potential impact the PPACA will
have on our business, certain of the mandates in the legislation are not yet effective. If our employee health benefit costs increase,
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to offset these costs through increased revenue or reductions in other costs,
which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

 For detailed information regarding recently
issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2,  New
Accounting Standards  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q. 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements   

 This report includes forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In general, forward-looking statements include
estimates of future revenues, cash flows, capital expenditures, or other financial items, and assumptions underlying any of the
foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations regarding future events and use words such
as  anticipate,   believe,   expect,   may,  and other similar terminology. A forward-looking
statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may
not occur. Investors should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this
report. These forward-looking statements are all based on currently available operating, financial, and competitive information
and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety
of factors, many beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, Risk Factors
of our annual report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise them, except as may be required by law.

ITEM 3.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      

The majority of our investments are
conducted through investment partnerships which generally hold common stocks. We also hold marketable securities directly. Through
investments in the investment partnerships we hold a concentrated position in the common stock of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,
Inc. A significant decline in the general stock market or in the prices of major investments may produce a large net loss and decrease
in our consolidated shareholders  equity. Decreases in values of equity investments can have a materially adverse effect
on our earnings and on consolidated shareholders  equity. 

We prefer to hold equity investments
for very long periods of time so we are not troubled by short-term price volatility with respect to our investments. Our interests
in the investment partnerships are committed on a rolling 5-year basis, and any distributions upon our withdrawal of funds will
be paid out over two years (and may be paid in kind rather than in cash). Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation.
Consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value.
A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the market price of our investments would result in a respective increase or decrease
in the carrying value of our investments of $49,006 along with a corresponding change in shareholders  equity of approximately
7%. 

Borrowings on Steak n Shake s
credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to a base rate or a Eurodollar rate (minimum of 1%) plus an applicable
margin. Interest on the term loan is based on a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 3.75% or on the prime rate plus an
applicable margin of 2.75%. Interest on loans under the revolver is based on a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging
from 2.75% to 4.25% or on the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.25%. At September 30, 2016, a hypothetical
100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would not have a significant impact on our net earnings. 

We have had minimal exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations in the third quarter of 2016. 

ITEM 4.         Controls and Procedures      

Based on an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)), our Chief Executive Officer and Controller
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or that
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part
II Other Information   

Item 1.             lEGAL PROCEEDINGS          

Information in response to this Item
is included in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1 Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and is incorporated
herein by reference. 

Item 1A.             Risk Factors          

An investment in the common stock of
any company involves a degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described in the Company s
annual report on Form 10 K filed with the SEC, as well as the risks subsequently disclosed in our reports filed with the
SEC, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that
we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm the Company s business, financial condition,
and results of operations. The occurrence of risk factors could harm the Company s business, financial condition, and results
of operations. The trading price of the Company s common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties,
and stockholders may lose part or all of their investment. 

The following material changes in the
risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for 2015.  

We are a  controlled company 
within the meaning of the NYSE rules and may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.    

 Because Mr. Biglari beneficially owns
more than 50% of the Company s outstanding voting stock, we are considered a  controlled company  pursuant to
New York Stock Exchange rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain director independence and board committee
requirements. 

Item 2.       Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

The following table presents information
on purchases of our common stock during the third quarter of 2016 by The Lion Fund II, L.P. and Sardar Biglari, each of whom may
be deemed to be an  affiliated purchaser  as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. On May 10, 2016, The Lion Fund II, L.P. entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan (the  Purchase Plan ) pursuant
to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the Purchase Plan, a broker dealer will make periodic
purchases of up to an aggregate of 68,000 shares of the Company s common stock on behalf of The Lion Fund II, L.P. at prevailing
market prices, subject to the terms of the Purchase Plan.
