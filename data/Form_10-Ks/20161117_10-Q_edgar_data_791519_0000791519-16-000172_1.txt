STAPLES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  
  (Unaudited) 

Note A       Basis of Presentation    
    
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Staples, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Staples  or  the Company ).  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  These financial statements are for the period covering the   13   and   39   weeks ended   October 29, 2016   (also referred to as the    third quarter of     2016  " and "  year-to-date     2016  ") and the period covering the   13   and   39   weeks ended   October 31, 2015   (also referred to as the    third quarter of     2015    and "  year-to-date     2015  ").   
    
  These financial statements have been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods.  In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  For a more complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other information, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   ("Annual Report").    
    
  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.  Our business is somewhat seasonal, with sales and profitability historically higher during the second half of our fiscal year due to the back-to-school, holiday and January back-to-business seasons. 

Note B       Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
    
  In March 2016, a pronouncement was issued that aims to simplify several aspects of accounting and reporting for share-based payment transactions.  One provision requires that excess income tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payments be recognized within income tax expense in the statement of income, rather than within additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact that this provision, which is to be applied prospectively, will have on its financial statements.  The Company does not expect the other provisions within the pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial statements.  The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted.    
    
  In August 2016, a pronouncement was issued that addresses diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance provides clarity around the cash flow classification for eight specific issues in an effort to reduce the current and potential future diversity in practice. The standard, which is to be applied retrospectively, will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In October 2016, a pronouncement was issued that aims to reduce the diversity in practice and complexity associated with accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party.  The new pronouncement stipulates that an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.   The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted in the first interim period only. The amendments are to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note C       Strategic Initiatives, Restructuring and Related Charges    
  Staples 20/20 Plan     
  In May 2016 the Company announced a strategic plan under which it plans to: 
             
    focus on its North American operations, in particular on the mid-market sector by accelerating growth in services and products beyond office supplies 
                
    increase productivity and preserve profitability in its retail stores

     Table of Contents  
  STAPLES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

pursue acquisitions of business-to-business service providers and companies specializing in categories beyond office supplies 
                
    execute a new multi-year cost savings plan which is expected to generate approximately   $300 million   of annualized pre-tax cost savings by the end of 2018, primarily by reducing product costs and increasing our mix of higher margin Staples Brand products, driving productivity in our supply chain, and evolving our pricing and promotional strategies.  
     Following the termination of its merger agreement with Office Depot and the announcement of the 20/20 Plan, the Company and Ron Sargent mutually agreed it was the right time to transition to new management, and therefore the Company announced in May 2016 that Mr. Sargent would step down from the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective June 14, 2016.  The Company and Mr. Sargent entered into a letter agreement providing for monthly payments of   $166,740   for a period of 24 months commencing February 2017, as well as certain benefits with an estimated cost of   $875,000  .  The Company recorded a liability for these severance benefits in the second quarter of 2016, the related cost for which is included in Restructuring charges in the condensed consolidated statement of income. 
  During the third quarter of   2016  , the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $5 million   related to the 20/20 Plan, primarily related to severance benefits associated with strategic changes in the Company's International Operations segment. No material cash payments were made during the third quarter of 2016 related to these charges. 
  In connection with the   $300 million   cost savings plan, in the second quarter of 2016 the Company incurred charges  of   $6 million   related to exiting certain product categories in its North American retail stores, of which   $4 million   is included in Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs and   $2 million   is included in Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see   Note D   -   Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets  ).   No similar costs were incurred in the third quarter of 2016. 
  In the third quarter and year-to-date 2016, the Company incurred   $5 million   and   $10 million   of costs in connection with exploring strategic alternatives for its European operations.  These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
  As the Company continues to execute its 20/20 Plan, additional charges may be incurred.  The nature and timing of the  charges will depend upon the actions that are taken, and cannot be estimated at this time.   
  2014 Restructuring Plan   
  In 2014 the Company announced a plan to close at least   225   retail stores in North America by the end of fiscal year 2015. Pursuant to this plan, the Company closed   242   stores in 2014 and   2015  .  This plan has been extended and the Company expects to close at least   50   additional stores in North America during   2016  .  In connection with these additional closures, in 2016 the Company currently expects to incur charges of approximately   $15 million   to   $30 million   for contractual lease obligations, less than   $5 million   for severance and up to   $10 million   in other associated costs.  These charges relate to the Company's North American Stores   Online segment.  
  In   2014   the Company also initiated a cost savings plan to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately   $500 million   by the end of fiscal   2015  .  Actions related to the cost savings plan were largely complete as of the end of 2015. 
  During the third quarter and year-to-date   2016  , the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $2 million   and   $16 million   related to the closure of retail stores, primarily related to lease obligations associated with the closed stores.  These charges relate to the Company's North American Stores   Online segment. 
  During year-to-date 2016, the Company recorded adjustments to reduce the employee-related liabilities by   $5 million  , primarily as a result of certain changes to the scope of planned initiatives and actual forfeitures being higher than previous estimates.  During year-to-date 2016, the Company also recorded adjustments to reduce contractual obligations by   $4 million  , reflecting lease terminations that were negotiated during this period.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The table below shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability balances for each major type of cost associated with the 2014 Restructuring Plan (in millions): 

In addition to the contractual obligations shown in the table above, the Company also has a related liability of   $11 million   and   $8 million   recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  , which primarily represents amounts previously accrued to reflect rent expense on a straight-line basis for leased properties which the Company has now ceased using. 
    
  For the restructuring liabilities associated with the 2014 Restructuring Plan,   $25 million   of contractual obligations are included within Other long-term obligations and the remaining balances are included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   October 29, 2016  .  The Company expects that payments related to employee-related liabilities will be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company anticipates that payments related to facility lease obligations will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025. 
    
  In the third quarter and year-to-date   2015  , the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $22 million   and   $87 million  , respectively, related to the 2014 Restructuring Plan.  These charges primarily related to the restructuring of the Company's North American delivery operations and general and administrative functions in Europe and at its corporate headquarters. The Company also recorded   $8 million   of charges for accelerated depreciation and impairment of long-lived assets in year-to-date 2015, primarily related to the closure of facilities supporting the Company's North American delivery operations.  
    
  The table below shows how the restructuring charges would have been allocated if the Company had recorded the expenses within the functional departments of the restructured activities (in millions):

Note D       Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets    
    
  Long-Lived Assets  
       
  The Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of   $44 million   and   $2 million   during the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The charges during the third quarter of 2016 include   $30 million   related to an intangible asset associated with the Company's International Operations segment, which the Company concluded was impaired based on assessments of future cash flows and the fair value of the asset using the income approach.  The charges during the third quarter of 2016 also include   $14 million   primarily related to assets at retail stores in Europe that have not been identified for closure.  The Company determined the carrying values of these assets were not recoverable from future cash flows, primarily as a result of declining sales.  The   $2 million   of charges during the third quarter of 2015 related to the closure of North American retail stores.  The charges during the third quarter of 2016 primarily relate to the International Operations segment, while the charges in the third quarter of 2015 related to the North American Stores   Online segment. 
    
  During the   year-to-date     2016   and year-to-date   2015  , the Company recorded total long-lived asset impairment charges of    $74 million   and   $25 million  , respectively.  The   $74 million   of charges recorded during the   year-to-date     2016   includes   $30 million   related to the impairment of the intangible asset,   $27 million   related to the impairment of assets at European retail stores, and   $17 million   related to the impairment of assets at North American retail stores.  The   $25 million   of charges recorded during the year-to-date   2015   included   $22 million   related to the disposal of information technology assets related to the Company's North American Stores   Online segment, and   $3 million   related to assets at North American retail stores.     
    
  The charges related to retail stores were based on measurements of the fair value of the impaired assets derived using the income and market approaches. The measurements determined using the income approach incorporated Level 3 inputs as defined in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ("ASC Topic 820"). The Company considered the expected net cash flows to be generated by the use of the assets, as well as the expected cash proceeds from the disposition of the assets, if any.  
    
  Goodwill    
       
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing and concluded that no impairment charges were required at that time.  In the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year 2015, the Company disclosed that its Europe Online reporting unit, which had   $266 million   of goodwill as of January 30, 2016, was at an increased risk for future impairment.   
  As a result of changes in its organizational structure and the centralization of certain functions, in the first quarter of 2016 the Company combined its Europe Online and Europe Contract businesses into a single reporting unit ("Europe Delivery").  In the first quarter of 2016 the Company disclosed that Europe Delivery, which is a component of the Company s International Operations segment, was at an increased risk for future impairment charges.  Europe Delivery had associated goodwill of   $630 million   as of the second quarter of 2016. 
  In the second quarter of 2016, based on continued adverse business trends and following changes in the Company s strategic plans post termination of the proposed Office Depot merger, the Company identified certain factors that now indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Europe Delivery reporting unit was lower than its carrying value.  These factors included: 
             
    Europe Delivery continued to experience operating challenges during the second quarter of 2016, and expected further challenges in the near to mid-term as a result of delays in its restructuring and transformation activities. 
                
    Britain s decision in June 2016 to exit the European Union ( Brexit ) resulted in increased uncertainty in the economic and political environment in Europe. 
                
    In May 2016, Staples announced a strategic plan under which it would focus on its North American businesses, reducing its emphasis on International Operations.  The Company announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its European operations, and hired outside advisors to evaluate a potential sale of the business. 
                
    Information obtained in the second quarter during the process of marketing the European business for sale, including the likely absence of strategic buyers and the indications of value received from potential financial buyers.

The Company concluded its European operations did not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of the end of the second quarter of 2016.  Based on its consideration of the factors above, the Company concluded it was necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2016 for the Europe Delivery reporting unit pursuant to the guidelines of ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other".    
  In the first step of the impairment test, the Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the income and market approaches, specifically the discounted cash flow ( DCF ) and guideline public company methods.  In the past the Company has not relied upon the market approach because it believed there was an insufficient number of relevant guideline companies and comparable transactions.  As a result of additional information that became available in connection with Staples  current efforts to evaluate a potential sale of its European operations, the Company concluded that the use of a market approach would be appropriate given objective evidence obtained regarding reasonable ranges of market multiples. 
  The key assumptions and estimates used in the DCF method included: 
             
    The reporting unit's projections for financial results over a fifteen year period, which reflected management's expectations of the development time for the reporting unit s online businesses to grow to sufficient scale and replace the legacy catalog businesses.  The reporting unit s fair value is most sensitive to assumptions related to sales growth and operating profit rates, which represent estimates based on current and projected sales mix, profit improvement opportunities, and market conditions.   The projections used in the current year model also now included estimates of the costs a financial buyer would incur to operate the business on a standalone basis, and reduced savings as a result of the delays in the execution of its restructuring and transformation plans. 
                
    The discount rate, which is used to measure the present value of the reporting unit s projected future cash flows, including those relating to the reporting unit's terminal value. The discount rate is based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") that reflects market and industry data as well as risk factors specific to the reporting unit that are likely to be considered by a market participant.  The WACC represents the Company s estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. 
       
  The key assumptions and estimates used in the guideline public company method included: 
             
    Selection of guideline companies that are reasonably similar to the Europe Delivery reporting unit in terms of industry, financial and risk profiles.  The Company concluded there was limited publicly available information related to European companies that are similar in nature to its European operations.  Therefore, the Company used large multi-national companies in the guideline public company analysis. 
                
    Determination of an appropriate market multiple.  The Company assessed the business enterprise values of the guideline companies in relation to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ).  The Company then evaluated an appropriate multiple to apply to its Europe Delivery reporting unit, taking into consideration differences between the guideline companies and the reporting unit in terms of growth trends and profitability. 
       
  Based on its review of the valuations indicated by each of the income and market approaches, the Company concluded it was appropriate to weight each approach 50% to determine the valuation of the reporting unit.  The resulting fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, and therefore the reporting unit failed step one of the impairment test. 
    
  In the second step of the impairment test, the Company assigned the reporting unit s fair value to its individual assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized assets or liabilities, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.  If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge. The fair value estimates incorporated in step two for intangible assets were primarily based on the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods.   For owned real property, the Company used a combination of the income and market approaches to determine fair value.   
  The valuation methodologies used in step two incorporated unobservable inputs reflecting significant estimates and assumptions made by management.  Accordingly, the Company classified these measurements as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Key inputs included expected sales growth rates, customer attrition rates, operating income margins, market-based royalty rates, and discount rates. 
  Based on the results of the second step in the impairment test, the Company determined that the reporting unit s   $630 million   of goodwill was fully impaired, and therefore it recorded an impairment charge of this amount in the second quarter of 2016.

  STAPLES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill during year-to-date 2016 are as follows (in millions): 

The Company's International Operations segment had accumulated goodwill impairment charges of   $1.81 billion   and   $1.18 billion   as of October 29, 2016 and January 30, 2016, respectively. 
  As of the end of the third quarter of 2016, the Company was still in the process of evaluating a potential sale of its European operations, as well as other strategic options.  Therefore, as of the end of the third quarter the Company concluded that its European operations did not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. A decision regarding a potential sale is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.  If the Company were to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2016 that its European operations qualified to be classified as held for sale, the Company would expect to record charges at that time, which could be material.  As of October 29, 2016 the Company s European operations had long-lived assets of   $0.2 billion   which may become impaired at the time the business is classified as held for sale.  In the event a transaction is completed, additional charges would be expected related to   $0.6 billion   that is currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet, reflecting cumulative translation losses and potential losses associated with the curtailment and settlement of pension obligations.   These balances could change materially depending on, among other factors, the final sale price for the European operations, future changes in foreign exchange rates and market interest rates, the extent and form of disposition of the pension obligations, and the future operating results of the European operations. 

Note E       Sale of Businesses and Assets    
    
  In April 2016, Staples entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and transfer certain liabilities related to its commercial printing solutions business (Staples Print Solutions, or  SPS ) for cash consideration of   $85 million  . The transaction closed on July 5, 2016.  The sale price was subject to a working capital adjustment that is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Excluding the impact of pension settlements as discussed below, the Company recognized a loss of   $48 million   on the sale of SPS, of which   $32 million   and   $16 million   was recognized in the first and second quarters of 2016, respectively.  The loss recognized in the first quarter of 2016 represented a full write-down of the   $19 million   of goodwill and   $13 million   of long-lived assets associated with this business unit.  The loss is included in (Loss) gain on sale of businesses and assets, net in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  SPS was a component of the Company s North American Commercial segment.    
    
  In addition, as a result of the sale of SPS, the Company planned to settle SPS s pension obligations and terminate its pension plan, the benefits under which were previously frozen.  In connection with the settlements, the Company recognized a loss of   $2 million   in the third quarter of 2016, which is included  in (Loss) gain on sale of businesses and assets, net in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  The Company expects to recognize additional losses of approximately   $5 million   to   $10 million   during the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the full settlement of the remaining pension obligation.

SPS s pretax income in 2016 through the date of disposal was   $10 million  .  SPS's pretax income in the   third quarter   and   year-to-date   2015 was   $5 million   and   $17 million  , respectively.  The table below shows the major classes of SPS s assets and liabilities at the time of the disposition (in millions):   

During the   year-to-date   2015, the Company sold certain property and equipment in Europe and a small business in Australia, recognizing a net gain of   $3 million  .  

Note F      Income Taxes    
    
  The Company's effective tax rate in the year-to-date   2016   was   (7.3)%  , which compares with   28.8%   in the year-to-date   2015  .  The low tax rate in year-to-date   2016   is primarily attributable to the impact of a   $630 million   goodwill impairment charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to the Company's Europe Delivery reporting unit (see   Note D   -   Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets  ), the majority of which is not tax deductible. 

Note G           Debt and Credit Agreements    
    
  The Company has a   $1 billion   revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program that allows it to issue up to   $1 billion   of unsecured commercial paper notes from time to time, and for which the revolving credit facility serves as a back-up.  See Note F - Debt and Credit Agreements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 for more information on the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.    
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company borrowed and repaid   $180 million   under the revolving credit facility.  There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility during the third quarter of   2016  .   
    
  The Company borrowed under its commercial paper program during the   third quarter   of 2016.  The maximum amount outstanding under the commercial paper program during the   third quarter   of 2016 was   $188 million  . Borrowings outstanding under the Company's commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility by a commensurate amount.  As of   October 29, 2016  , there was no commercial paper outstanding.   

Note H       Fair Value Measurements    
    
  ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement), then priority to quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market (Level 2 measurement), then the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). 
    
  The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other current liabilities and short-term debt approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature.  The carrying values of the Company's capital lease and commercial paper obligations approximate fair value.

The following table shows the difference between the financial statement carrying value and fair value of the Company's debt obligations as of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016   (in millions).  The fair values of these notes were determined based on quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1 measurements. 

From time to time, the Company invests in money market funds that are measured and recorded in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis.  The fair values are based on quotes received from third-party banks and are classified as Level 1 measurements.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the fair value of these investments, which are classified as Cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, was   $120 million  .  There were no material money market investments as of   January 30, 2016  .  
    
  There were no other material assets or liabilities measured at fair value. 

Note I       Proposed Acquisition of Office Depot    
    
  On February 4, 2015, Staples announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Office Depot, a global supplier of office products, services and solutions for the workplace.  On December 7, 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canadian Commissioner of Competition each filed lawsuits against the Company and Office Depot, seeking to block the proposed merger and prevent the acquisition from closing.  On May 10, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Federal Trade Commission s request for a preliminary injunction against the proposed acquisition, and as a result Staples and Office Depot terminated the merger agreement on May 16, 2016.  Per the terms of the merger agreement, on May 19, 2016 Staples paid Office Depot a   $250 million   break-up fee.  
       
  In connection with the termination of the merger agreement, Staples also terminated the previously announced agreement to sell customer contracts representing more than   $550 million   of revenue and related assets to Essendant Inc. 
  In year-to-date fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred expenses of   $24 million   and   $33 million   in connection with the proposed transaction, primarily related to professional services associated with seeking regulatory clearances.  These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. The Company also incurred fees and interest related to term loan financing for the transaction, as discussed below. 
  Transaction financing   
    
  In connection with the Company's proposed acquisition of Office Depot, during 2015 Staples obtained commitments for a   5  -year   $3 billion   asset-based revolving credit facility and a   6  -year   $2.75 billion   term loan.   On February 2, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive term loan agreement with a syndicate of lenders, and Barclays as administrative agent and collateral agent, under which it borrowed   $2.5 billion   in the first quarter of 2016.  The   $2.475 billion   of net proceeds from the term loan were deposited into escrow accounts.   
    
  As a result of the termination of the merger agreement, the agreements governing the term loan and commitments for the asset-based revolving credit facility were terminated, and on May 13, 2016 the   $2.5 billion   par value of the term loan was repaid to the lenders.  The receipt of the   $2.475 billion   of net proceeds and subsequent repayment of the loan at par are not reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, given that the proceeds were deposited directly into escrow rather than into the Company's unrestricted cash accounts, and were repaid to the lenders directly from escrow.  
    
  The Company paid interest and fees related to these sources of financing of   $156 million   in year-to-date 2016.  Of this amount,   $91 million   was accrued in 2015; and   $39 million   was recorded as interest expense in   year-to-date     2016  , respectively; and   $26 million   was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2016, related to the acceleration of the unamortized balances of the   $25 million   original issue discount ("OID") and   $2 million   of deferred financing costs related to the term loan.  The Company also earned   $2 million   of interest income on the amounts held in escrow.  
    
  During year-to-date 2016 the Company made cash payments totaling   $66 million   into the escrow accounts, representing deposits for the   1.0%   OID and for the monthly interest payments related to the term loan.  These amounts are included in Increase in restricted cash within the Investing Activities section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for year-to-date 2016.  Of the   $156 million   of total interest and fees paid during year-to-date 2016: 
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  
  STAPLES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

$68 million   was paid directly from the escrow accounts to the lenders (representing the   $66 million   paid into escrow plus the   $2 million   of interest income earned on the funds held therein).  Because these payments were made directly from escrow, they are considered non-cash operating activities that are not reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.   
                
       $88 million   was paid from Staples unrestricted cash accounts.  This amount is reflected in the Operating activities section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for year-to-date 2016.   
       
  There were no amounts remaining in escrow as of October 29, 2016. 

Note J       Equity Based Employee Benefit Plans    
    
  Staples offers its associates share ownership through certain equity-based employee compensation and benefit plans.  In connection with these plans, Staples recognized   $15 million   and   $47 million   in compensation expense for the   third quarter   and   year-to-date     2016  , respectively, and   $15 million   and   $49 million   in compensation expense for the   third quarter   and   year-to-date     2015  , respectively.  As of   October 29, 2016  , Staples had   $82 million   of unamortized stock compensation expense associated with these plans which will be expensed over the period through   September 2019  .   
    
  Under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company may grant restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively,  Restricted Shares ) and non-qualified stock options to associates.    
    
  Restricted shares 
  The following table summarizes the activity during the   year-to-date     2016   related to Restricted Shares:

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 

Performance shares 
    
  The Company has entered into performance share arrangements with certain executives.  Each arrangement covers a three year performance period.  Payout under these arrangements may range from   25%   to   200%   of target for each performance metric, depending on actual performance.  Any award earned based on performance achieved may be increased or decreased by   25%   if the Company's cumulative total shareholder return ("TSR") over the three year performance period is in the top or bottom one-third of the S P 500 TSR, respectively.  Shares earned, if any, will be issued on a fully-vested basis at the conclusion of the three-year performance period only if the grantee is still actively employed by or serving as a consultant to the Company at that time, with certain exceptions for retirement, death, disability, and termination without cause.  
  For the arrangements entered into in April 2016, vesting is based on cumulative performance over a three year period comprising fiscal years 2016 to 2018, and is   50%   based on achieving certain operating income growth targets and   50%   based on achieving certain return on net assets percentage targets.   As of October 29, 2016, the aggregate target number of shares for this award is   0.9 million  , net of forfeitures, with a grant-date fair value of $  9 million  . 
  For the arrangements entered into in April of 2013 and March of 2014 and March of 2015, vesting for these awards is based on performance achieved in each fiscal year, with metrics established at the beginning of each year, and is   50%   based on satisfaction of certain sales growth metrics and   50%   based on achievement of certain return on net assets percentage targets.   The following summarizes activity related to these awards during year-to-date 2016: 
             
    April 2013 award:   Upon completion of the three-year performance period, in April 2016 a total of   0.8 million   shares were issued on a fully vested basis, which reflects a   25%   reduction related to the TSR multiplier.       
      Stock options 
  No stock options were granted during   year-to-date     2016  .  During   year-to-date     2016   no stock options were exercised.  
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  Staples offers its associates the opportunity for share ownership pursuant to the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  During   year-to-date     2016   and   2015  , the Company issued    2.1 million   shares and   1.3 million   shares, respectively, pursuant to this plan. 

Note K       Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans    
    
  The Company sponsors pension plans that cover certain employees in Europe and the U.S.  The benefits due to U.S. plan participants are frozen.  A number of the defined benefit plans outside the U.S. are funded with plan assets that have been segregated in trusts.  Contributions are made to these trusts, as necessary, to meet legal and other requirements.   
    
  The Company also sponsors an unfunded post-retirement life insurance benefit plan, which provides benefits to eligible U.S. executives based on earnings, years of service and age at termination of employment.

For the   third quarter   of   2016  , approximately   18 million   equity instruments were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For   year-to-date     2016  , approximately   30 million   equity instruments were excluded as the Company has recorded a net loss for the period. For the   third quarter   and   year-to-date     2015  , approximately   18 million   and   20 million   equity instruments, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Note N       Segment Reporting    
        
  Staples has   three   reportable segments:  North American Commercial, North American Stores   Online and International Operations.  
    
  The following is a summary of sales and business unit income by reportable segment and a reconciliation of business unit income to income before income taxes for the   third quarter   and   year-to-date     2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

Note O       Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  The Company has investigated, with the assistance of outside experts, a data security incident involving unauthorized access into the computer systems of PNI Digital Media Ltd ("PNI"), a subsidiary of the Company, which the Company acquired in July 2014.  PNI, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, provides a software platform that enables retailers to sell personalized products such as photo prints, photo books, calendars, business cards, stationery and other similar products. PNI s customers include a number of major third party retailers, as well as affiliates of the Company. The investigation determined that an unauthorized party entered PNI s systems and was able to deploy malware on some of PNI s servers supporting its clients. The malware was designed to capture data that end users input on the photosites. Some of PNI's affected customers have notified certain of their users of a potential compromise of the users' payment card information and/or other personal information. PNI took prompt steps to contain the incident, including disabling the retailer photosites or online payment transactions for a period while the incident was being investigated, and to further enhance the security of its retailer customers' data. To date the Company has incurred incremental expenses of   $18 million   related to the incident. The expenses reflect professional service fees incurred by the Company, claims by PNI's retailer customers and litigation settlement amounts. Additional losses and expenses relating to the incident are probable; however, at this stage, the Company does not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate such losses and expenses. The types of losses and expenses that may result from the incident include, without limitation: claims by PNI s retailer customers, including indemnification claims for losses and damages incurred by them; claims by end-users of PNI s services, including class action lawsuits that have been filed, and further class action lawsuits that may be filed, in Canada and the United States; investigations and claims by various regulatory authorities in Canada and the United States; investigation costs; remediation costs; and legal fees.  The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for additional losses or expenses at the time or times when it is both probable that any loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable. Such losses may be material to our results of operations and financial condition. The Company maintains network-security insurance coverage, which the Company expects would help mitigate the financial impact of the incident.

In December 2014, the Company announced that the investigation into its previously announced data security incident had determined that malware deployed by criminals to some point of sale systems at   115   of the Company s more than   1,400   U.S. retail stores may have allowed access to transaction data at those affected stores. As a result, cardholder names, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card verification codes for approximately   1.16 million   payment cards may have been affected.   Upon detection, the Company immediately took action to eradicate the malware and commenced an investigation into the incident, working closely with payment card companies and law enforcement and with the assistance of outside data security experts.  The Company also has taken steps to further enhance the security of its point of sale systems, including the use of new encryption tools. The Company continues to evaluate cybersecurity policies and practices to mitigate the risk of future incidents.  Expenses incurred to date related to this incident have not been material. It is reasonably possible that the Company may incur additional expenses or losses in connection with the incident; however, at this time the Company is unable to reasonably estimate any such additional expenses or losses.  In addition, the Company maintains network-security insurance coverage, which it expects would help mitigate any material financial impact. 
    
  In 2013 the Company completed the sale of its European Printing Systems Division ("PSD"), recognizing a preliminary loss on disposal of   $81 million   that is subject to the impact of a working capital adjustment to the purchase price.  On April 22, 2015, the purchaser commenced litigation in Amsterdam District Court claiming that it was entitled to a purchase price adjustment of    60 million  .  On April 22, 2015, the Company made a payment to the purchaser of approximately    4 million   (the amount of the purchase price adjustment it believed was appropriate) and the purchaser reduced its claim accordingly.  The purchaser further reduced its claim to    52 million   in response to expert reports submitted by the Company in the court case.  The court held a hearing on December 1, 2015, and on January 13, 2016, it issued a judgment rejecting the purchaser's claims in their entirety and awarding costs to the Company.  The purchaser filed a notice of appeal on February 15, 2016, which the Company opposed.  The Court held a hearing on the appeal on September 14, 2016, and its ruling is pending.  If the purchaser prevails on appeal, it could result in an adjustment, which may be material, to the loss we recorded for the transaction. 
    
  In 2012, plaintiff Bobby Dean Nickel filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Company and its subsidiary, Staples Contract   Commercial, Inc. The lawsuit alleged that Nickel s 2011 termination was based on his age (over 40).  In August 2013, the trial court denied summary judgment on the age discrimination claim, but granted it as to all other claims.  On February 26, 2014, after trial, the jury returned a verdict in plaintiff s favor, awarding him approximately   $3 million   in compensatory damages and approximately   $22 million   in punitive damages.  The Company filed a series of post-trial motions asking the trial court to vacate the jury verdict and order a new trial or, if the verdict is not vacated, to reduce the amount of damages awarded through the process of remittitur.  The trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the punitive damages assessed against Staples, Inc., reducing the total judgment to approximately   $16 million  . The trial court also awarded Nickel approximately   $1 million   in attorneys  fees and costs.  The Company filed an appeal with the California Court of Appeal in November 2015 and the matter was heard in April 2016.  On May 26, 2016, the Court of Appeal ruled against the Company, and subsequently denied the Company s Request for Rehearing.  On July 5, 2016, Staples filed a Petition for Review with the California Supreme Court.  On July 19, 2016, Nickel filed his Answer to the Petition for Review and on July 28, 2016, Staples filed its Reply to Nickel s Answer to the Petition for Review.  The Supreme Court denied the petition for review on August 10, 2016. Staples subsequently paid approximately   $22 million   to satisfy the outstanding judgment, including interest and Nickel's attorney's fees and costs.  
    
  From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation arising from the operation of its business that is considered routine and incidental to its business. The Company estimates exposures and establishes reserves for our estimated significant liabilities that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies could be unexpected or differ from the Company s reserves. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that a loss in excess of the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of   October 29, 2016   would have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition, or cash flows.

  Divestiture of Staples UK Retail business 
    On November 16, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which it will sell its retail business in the United Kingdom ( Staples UK Retail ) for nominal proceeds.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In connection with this transaction, the Company expects to recognize a loss estimated at   $70   -   $80 million   during the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of certain ongoing lease obligations which the Company will continue to guarantee. The Company expects to recognize a liability in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the fair value of the guarantees, the impact of which will be reflected in the amount of the loss recognized related to the divestiture.  At this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the liability, which could material. 
  Staples UK Retail generated sales of   $302 million   during 2015 and   $177 million   during the year-to-date 2016, with operating losses of   $17 million   and   $6 million   during those same periods.   
  Acquisition of Capital Office Products 
  On November 7, 2016, the Company acquired Capital Office Products, which delivers office-related supplies to commercial customers in the southeastern U.S.  Capital Office Products, which will be a component of the Company s North American Commercial segment, had revenues of approximately   $106 million   during the twelve month period ending October 31, 2016.

Results of Operations  
    
  Major contributors to our   third quarter of     2016   results, as compared to the results for the   third quarter of     2015  , are reviewed in detail in the Consolidated Performance and Segment Performance discussions and are summarized below:   

We generated   $5.4 billion   in sales, a   decrease   of   4.2%  ;      

North American Commercial sales   decreased     2.9%   and business unit income rate   increased   to   8.1%   from   7.9%  ; 

North American Stores   Online sales   decreased     4.5%   and business unit income rate increased to   7.8%   from   7.7%  ; 

International Operations sales   decreased     7.2%   and business unit income rate increased to 0.7% from break-even;  

Net income for the   third quarter of   2016 reflects pre-tax charges of   $44 million   for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, $11 million of costs related to our strategic plans, and a $2 million loss on disposal of businesses and assets. 

See the non-GAAP reconciliations in the "Non-GAAP Measures" section further below.  
    
  Outlook 
    
  For the fourth quarter of   2016  , we expect sales to decrease versus the fourth quarter of   2015  , which reflects, in part, the divestiture of non-core businesses.  We expect to achieve fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.23 to $0.26 for the fourth quarter of   2016  .  This reflects continued progress on our cost savings initiatives, offset by increased investments to accelerate growth in the mid-market sector. Our earnings guidance excludes potential charges related to our strategic plans, including restructuring and related initiatives as well as the ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives for our European operations.  For the full year 2016, we expect to generate approximately $700 million of free cash flow, excluding the after-tax impact to operating cash flow of approximately $340 million of charges associated with financing for the proposed acquisition of Office Depot and costs associated with the termination of the Office Depot merger agreement.  Our guidance reflects the following material trends, events, uncertainties and strategic actions:   

We operate a portfolio of businesses.  We plan to accelerate growth in Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business, where we have momentum and best in class offerings to build on.  At the same time we are focused on maximizing profitability and reducing risk in our underperforming North American retail and European businesses. 
                
    Our guidance assumes that we will close at least 50 retail stores in North America in 2016 as an extension of our store closure plan announced in 2014, in light of ongoing declines in comparable store sales. We will evaluate our remaining store portfolio on an ongoing basis as performance and market conditions change. 
                
    We plan to accelerate growth in our delivery businesses, focusing on providing services and products beyond office supplies that are targeted toward mid-market business customers. 
                
    We have experienced ongoing weakness in our European businesses, which we expect to continue.  We are currently exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations.  The strategic actions that are ultimately taken (if any) may trigger the recognition of additional charges, as discussed in   Note D   -   Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Any additional charges are not reflected in our guidance. 
                
    Our profitability is affected by changes in the mix of products and services we sell, and the prices at which we sell them. We plan to preserve profitability through reducing product costs, optimizing promotions, increasing the mix of Staples Brand products, and reducing operating expenses, which we expect will generate approximately $300 million of annualized pre-tax cost savings by the end of 2018.  The profit improvement anticipated in 2016 under these initiatives has been reflected in our guidance.

Termination of Office Depot Merger Agreement 
  On February 4, 2015, Staples announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Office Depot, a global supplier of office products, services and solutions for the workplace.  On December 7, 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canadian Commissioner of Competition each filed lawsuits against the Company and Office Depot, seeking to block the proposed merger and prevent the acquisition from closing.  On May 10, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Federal Trade Commission s request for a preliminary injunction against the proposed acquisition, and as a result Staples and Office Depot terminated the merger agreement on May 16, 2016.   See   Note I   -   Proposed Acquisition of Office Depot   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to costs associated with terminating the merger agreement and interest and fees associated with the related financing agreements.  
    
  Non-GAAP Measures 
    
    In our analysis of the results of operations and in our outlook, we have referred to certain non-GAAP financial measures for sales, net income, earnings per share, effective tax rate, and free cash flow (which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures). The presentation of these results should be considered in addition to, and should not be considered superior to, or as a substitute for, the presentation of results determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing meaningful information that facilitates the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the operating results of our business against prior year results and our operating plan, and to forecast and analyze future periods. We recognize there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as they may reduce comparability with other companies that use different methods to calculate similar non-GAAP measures. We generally compensate for these limitations by considering GAAP as well as non-GAAP results. In addition, management provides a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. With respect to our earnings per share and free cash flow guidance, we have not provided guidance on a GAAP basis given that our current estimates for charges to be incurred related to our strategic and restructuring plans, and the potential related impact on cash flow, cannot be reasonably estimated.  
    
  For the non-GAAP measures related to results of operations, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are shown below (amounts in millions, except per share data):

  Consolidated Performance 
       
  Third Quarter of     2016   Compared to the   Third Quarter of     2015 
    
  Sales:    Sales for the   third quarter of     2016   were   $5.4 billion  , a   $238 million   or   4.2%     decrease   from the   third quarter of     2015  .  The sales decline was primarily driven by approximately a 2% decrease resulting from the divestiture of our Staples Print Solutions business ("SPS") in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease in North American comparable store sales, decreasing sales in our European businesses, and an approximate 1% negative impact associated with store closures in North America.  Partly offsetting the impact of these items was a 1% favorable impact related to sales growth in North American Commercial, excluding the impact of the sale of SPS, and continued strong sales growth in China.  Declines in ink and toner, office supplies, business machines and technology accessories and mobility were partly offset by growth in facilities supplies, food and breakroom supplies and technology products. 
    
  Gross Profit:    Gross profit as a percentage of sales was   26.9%   for the   third quarter of     2016   compared to   27.2%   for the   third quarter of     2015  , a decrease of 30 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by increased supply chain costs and the unfavorable impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. 
     
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:    Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   by   $85 million   or   7.3%   from the   third quarter of     2015   to the   third quarter of     2016  .  The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation expense.  Selling, general and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2016 included $5 million of costs associated with exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations, and the expense for the   third quarter of   2015 included $12 million of costs for legal and professional services associated with our proposed acquisition of Office Depot. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were   20.1%   in the   third quarter of     2016   compared with   20.8%   in the   third quarter of     2015  . 
    
    Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets  :  See   Note D   -   Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges recognized in the third quarters of   2016   and   2015  . 
    
    Restructuring and Related Charges  :  See   Note C   -   Strategic Initiatives, Restructuring and Related Charges   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the restructuring charges recognized in the third quarters of   2016   and   2015  .   
    
  (Loss) Gain Related to Sale of Business and Assets, net:     See   Note E   -   Sale of Businesses and Assets   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the loss recognized in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Other Income (Expense), Net:    Other income (expense), net was an expense of   $4 million   in the   third quarter of     2016   compared to an expense of   $8 million   for the   third quarter of     2015  .  The change primarily reflects lower investment losses associated with our supplemental executive retirement plan in the   third quarter of   2016 compared with the   third quarter of   2015. 
    
  Interest Expense  :  Interest expense   decreased   to   $11 million   for the   third quarter of     2016   from   $40 million   for the   third quarter of     2015  .   Interest expense during the third quarter of 2015 reflected interest and fees of $28 million related to financing arrangements associated with our proposed acquisition of Office Depot (see   Note I   -   Proposed Acquisition of Office Depot   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).

     Table of Contents  

Income Taxes:    Our effective tax rate was   36.9%   in the   third quarter of     2016   compared with   27.0%   in the   third quarter of     2015  .  Excluding the impact of items shown in the tables included above in the "Non-GAAP Measures" section, our effective tax rate was 35.5% in the   third quarter of     2016   and 33.5% the   third quarter of     2015  .  The increase in our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the   third quarter of   2016 compared with the prior year quarter is primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of earnings. 
    
  Our effective tax rate in any year is impacted by the geographic mix of earnings.  Additionally, certain foreign operations are subject to both U.S. and foreign income tax regulations, and as a result, income before tax by location and the components of income tax expense by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.  The difference between the federal statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate is driven primarily by the foreign rate differential in our entities in Canada and the Netherlands.   
       
  Year-to-date     2016   Compared to the   Year-to-date     2015 
    
  Sales:    Sales for   year-to-date     2016   were   $15.2 billion  , a   $583 million   or   3.7%     decrease   from   year-to-date     2015  .  The sales decline was primarily driven by a decrease in North American comparable store sales, decreasing sales in our European businesses, a 1% unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, and an approximate 1% negative impact associated with store closures in North America.  Sales were favorably impacted by 1% due to growth in North American Commercial, excluding the impact of the sale of SPS.  Declines in ink and toner, business machines and technology accessories, office supplies and mobility were partly offset by growth in facilities supplies, food and breakroom supplies, promotional products, technology products and copy and print services. 
    
  Gross Profit:    Gross profit as a percentage of sales was   25.8%   for   year-to-date     2016   compared to   26.2%   for   year-to-date     2015  , a decrease of 36 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross margin rates in our North American Commercial and International segments, increased supply chain costs, and the unfavorable impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:    Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   by   $189 million   or   5.5%   from   year-to-date     2015   to   year-to-date     2016  .   The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation expense and lower marketing expense, partially offset by $24 million of costs associated with our proposed acquisition of Office Depot, $17 million of costs related to litigation, and $10 million of costs incurred in connection with exploring strategic alternatives for our European operations. Selling, general and administrative expense for year-to-date 2015 included $33 million in legal and professional fees associated with our proposed acquisition of Office Depot.  As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were   21.5%   in   year-to-date     2016   compared with   21.9%   for   year-to-date     2015  . 
    
    Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets  :  See   Note D   -   Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges recognized during the year-to-date   2016   and   2015  . 
    
    Restructuring Charges  :  See   Note C   -   Strategic Initiatives, Restructuring and Related Charges   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the restructuring charges recognized during year-to-date   2016   and   2015  .  
    
  (Loss) Gain on Sale of Businesses and Assets, net:    See   Note E   -   Sale of Businesses and Assets   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the gains and losses recognized in year-to-date 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Other Income (Expense), Net:    Other income (expense), net was income of   $3 million   for   year-to-date     2016   compared to an expense of   $9 million   for   year-to-date     2015  .   The increased income in   year-to-date     2016   compared with the prior year was primarily due to increased investment gains associated with our supplemental executive retirement plan. 
    
  Interest Expense  :  Interest expense   decreased   to   $71 million   for   year-to-date     2016   from   $90 million   for   year-to-date     2015  .  Interest expense during year-to-date 2016 and 2015 reflected interest and fees of $39 million and $56 million, respectively, related to financing arrangements associated with our proposed acquisition of Office Depot (see   Note I   -   Proposed Acquisition of Office Depot   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).    
    
  Income Taxes:    Our effective tax rate was   (7.3)%   in   year-to-date     2016   compared with   28.8%   in   year-to-date     2015  .  The primary driver of the low tax rate in year-to-date 2016 was the $630 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Europe Delivery reporting unit, the majority of which is not tax deductible.  Excluding the impact of items shown in the tables included above in the "Non-GAAP Measures" section, our effective tax rate was 35.5% in   year-to-date     2016    and 33.5%   year-to-date     2015  .  The increase in our non-GAAP effective tax rate in   year-to-date     2016   compared with the prior year is primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of earnings.

Segment Performance 
    
  We have   three   reportable segments:  North American Commercial, North American Stores   Online and International Operations.  See   Note N   -   Segment Reporting   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of business unit income to income before income taxes. 
    
  Third Quarter of     2016   Compared to the   Third Quarter of     2015 
    
  The following tables provide a summary of our sales and business unit income by reportable segment for the   third quarter of     2016   and   2015  :  

North American Commercial:    Sales   decreased   by   $63 million   or   2.9%   for the   third quarter of     2016  .  The decline was primarily due to a 4% decrease resulting from the divestiture of SPS, partially offset by organic growth in Staples Business Advantage, our North American contract business.  Increased sales of facilities supplies, food and breakroom supplies and technology products were partially offset by declines in ink and toner and office supplies. 
    
  Business unit income as a percentage of sales   increased   to   8.1%   for the   third quarter of     2016   from   7.9%   for the   third quarter of     2015  . This increase was primarily driven by lower compensation expense, partially offset by increased supply chain costs and lower gross margin rates. 
    
  North American Stores   Online:    Sales   decreased   by   $117 million   or   4.5%   for the   third quarter of     2016  . This decrease was driven by a 4% decline in comparable stores sales, resulting primarily from lower customer traffic, and an approximate 1% negative impact from store closures.  Sales for Staples.com decreased 1%.  Comparable sales, which combines comparable store sales and Staples.com growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, declined 3%.  Declines in ink and toner, business machines, technology accessories, and mobility were partially offset by growth in computers and facilities supplies. 
     
  Business unit income as a percentage of sales   increased   to   7.8%   for the   third quarter of     2016   from   7.7%   for the    third quarter of     2015  .  The increase was driven by improved gross margin rates partially offset by the negative impact of lower sales on fixed costs. 
       
  International Operations:    Sales   decreased   by   $58 million   or   7.2%   for the   third quarter of     2016  .  The decrease was driven by a decline in our European delivery businesses, a   $20 million   unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, and a 10% decline in comparable store sales in Europe, which primarily reflects a decrease in customer traffic.  These declines were partially offset by continued growth in our contract business in China. 
    
  Business unit income as a percentage of sales was   0.7%   for the   third quarter of     2016   compared to   0.0%   for the   third quarter of     2015  .  The increase in income was primarily driven by improved profitability in Europe.

Year-to-date     2016   Compared to the   Year-to-date     2015    
    
  The following tables provide a summary of our sales and business unit income by reportable segment for   year-to-date     2016   and   2015  :  

North American Commercial:    Sales   decreased   by   $60 million   or   0.9%   for   year-to-date     2016  . The decline was primarily due to a 2% decrease resulting from the divestiture of SPS and a $12 million negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by organic growth in Staples Business Advantage.  Increased sales of facilities supplies, food and breakroom supplies, promotional products and copy and print were partially offset by decreased sales of ink and toner, paper and office supplies. 
    
  Business unit income as a percentage of sales was   7.4%   for   year-to-date     2016   compared to   7.0%   for   year-to-date     2015  . This increase was primarily driven by lower compensation expense and marketing expense, partially offset by lower gross margin rates and increased supply chain costs. 
    
  North American Stores   Online:   Sales   decreased   by   $362 million   or   5.1%   for   year-to-date     2016  . This decrease was driven by a 4% decline in comparable stores sales resulting primarily from lower customer traffic in the U.S., an approximate 1% negative impact from store closures, and a $43 million negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.  Sales were flat in Staples.com. Comparable sales, which combines comparable store sales and Staples.com growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, declined 3%.  Declines in business machines and technology accessories, ink and toner, mobility and office supplies were slightly offset by growth in facilities supplies.   
    
  Business unit income as a percentage of sales declined to   4.0%   for   year-to-date     2016   from   4.3%   for   year-to-date     2015  . The decrease was primarily driven by the negative impact of lower sales on fixed costs, partially offset by  lower compensation expense,  lower marketing expense and increased gross margin rates. 
    
    International Operations:    Sales   decreased   by   $161 million   or   6.8%   for   year-to-date     2016  .  The decrease was driven by a decline in our European delivery businesses, a   $67 million   unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates and an 10% decline in comparable store sales in Europe, which primarily reflects a decrease in customer traffic.  These declines were partially offset by continued growth in our contract business in China. 
    
  Business unit loss as a percentage of sales was   1.2%   for   year-to-date     2016   compared to   1.8%   for   year-to-date     2015  .  The  reduced rate of loss was primarily driven by improved profitability in Europe.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 
    
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Preparation of these statements requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. Some of our accounting policies require estimates which may have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements. A summary of our critical accounting policies and significant estimates may be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 ("Annual Report"). There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in that report.  
    
  In our Annual Report, we disclosed that our Europe Online reporting unit, which had $266 million of goodwill as of January 30, 2016, was at an increased risk for future impairment charges.  In our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016, we disclosed that we combined our Europe Online and Europe Contract businesses into a single reporting unit ("Europe Delivery") with aggregate goodwill of $647 million as of April 30, 2016, and stated that the Europe Delivery reporting unit was at an increased risk for future impairment charges.  In the second quarter of 2016, based on continued adverse business trends and following changes in the Company s strategic plans post termination of the proposed Office Depot merger, we concluded that certain factors indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Europe Delivery reporting unit was now lower than its carrying value, and accordingly we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit.  As a result of this test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $630 million in the second quarter of 2016, representing the full amount of goodwill associated with this reporting unit at the time of the test.  See   Note D   -   Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the indicators of impairment for this reporting unit, as well as the valuation approaches used by management and the related key assumptions and estimates in steps one and two of the impairment test.  The goodwill impairment test incorporated a significant amount of judgment on the part of management, including significant estimates and assumptions relating to projected long-term rates of growth, customer attrition, and profitability; selection of guideline companies and market multiples; market-based royalty rates; market values of real property; and discount rates. 
    
  The Company s U.S. Stores   Staples.com reporting unit ( USS O ) had $628 million of associated goodwill as of the end of the third quarter of 2016.  The Company s retail stores in the U.S. have continued to experience declines in sales and profits due to changes in customer buying patterns, with customers increasingly shopping at online retailers.  In addition, growth for Staples.com has been weaker than expected.  The Company continues to undertake initiatives to improve the productivity of its retail stores in the U.S. and increase customer traffic and conversion at Staples.com, while pursuing cost savings opportunities.  However, as a result of our consideration of these trends, at the end of the second quarter of 2016 we concluded the USS O reporting unit was at an increased risk for a future goodwill impairment charge.  The USS O reporting unit continues to be at an increased risk of an impairment charge as of the end of the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  In our Annual Report, we also disclosed that our China and Australia reporting units, which have $74 million and $50 million of goodwill as of October 29, 2016, respectively, were at an increased risk for future impairment charges.   We continue to closely monitor these reporting units during 2016. 
    
  The Company will perform its annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Cash provided by operations was   $630 million   for the   year-to-date     2016   compared to   $703 million   for the   year-to-date     2015  ,   a decrease   of   $73 million  .  The   year-to-date     2016   cash flows from operations reflect the payment of the $250 million merger termination fee to Office Depot, and the payment of $88 million of interest and fees related to the financing agreements associated with the proposed merger, partly offset by cash savings attributable to tax benefits related to these items.   The impact of these items was partly offset by favorable changes in working capital. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities was   $141 million   for the   year-to-date     2016   compared to   $227 million   for the   year-to-date     2015  ,   a decrease   of   $86 million  .  Capital expenditures during the   year-to-date     2016   declined by $57 million compared with  the   year-to-date     2015  , which reflects the impact of focused spending on strategic priorities and, in part, timing of expenditures.  In the year-to-date 2016, we received net proceeds of $83 million related to the sale of our Staples Print Solutions business.  Also in the   year-to-date     2016  , in connection with financing arrangements associated with our proposed acquisition of Office Depot, we transferred $66 million of cash into escrow accounts, which was disbursed directly to the lenders and underwriters as payment of interest and fees incurred.   

29 

     Table of Contents  

Cash used in financing activities was   $244 million   for   year-to-date     2016   compared to   $310 million   for   year-to-date     2015  , a decrease of   $66 million  .  The decrease primarily is attributable to higher net payments on borrowings in the first nine months of 2015 compared with the first nine months of 2016.  We paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share in year-to-date 2016 and 2015, for an aggregate payment of   $233 million   in year-to-date 2016 compared with   $231 million   in year-to-date 2015. 
    
  Sources of Liquidity 
    
  To cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various initiatives, we utilize cash generated from operations and borrowings available under various credit facilities and a commercial paper program.  At   October 29, 2016  , we had  approximately   $2.15 billion   in total cash and funds available through credit agreements, which consisted of   $1.07 billion   of available credit and   $1.08 billion   of cash and cash equivalents.    
    
  Of the   $1.08 billion   in cash and cash equivalents, approximately   $636 million   is held at entities located in jurisdictions outside the United States, and for which there could be tax consequences if such amounts were moved out of these jurisdictions or repatriated to the United States.  We currently intend to use these cash and cash equivalents to finance the obligations and current operations of our foreign businesses.  The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.  
    
  Our available credit includes   $1 billion   of maximum borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility with Bank of America and other lending institutions.  We did not borrow under our revolving credit facility during the third quarter of 2016.    
    
  We have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to   $1 billion   of unsecured commercial paper notes from time to time, and for which our   $1 billion   revolving credit facility serves as a back-up.  Borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility by a commensurate amount.  The maximum amount outstanding under the commercial paper program during the third quarter of 2016 was $188 million. As of October 29, 2016, there was no commercial paper outstanding.  See   Note F  -   Debt and Credit Agreements   in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 for more information on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.  
    
  We also have various other lines of credit under which we may currently borrow a maximum of   $79 million  .  At   October 29, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of   $4 million  , leaving   $75 million   of available credit at that date.   
       
  During year-to-date   2016  , we entered into $23 million of capital lease obligations.  
    
  A summary, as of   October 29, 2016  , of balances available under our credit agreements and debt outstanding is presented below (in millions): 

At   October 29, 2016  , there has not been a material change to the amounts and timing of maturity of contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report. 
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of   October 29, 2016  , nor did we utilize any during   year-to-date     2016  .  
    
  We expect that our cash generated from operations, together with our current cash, funds available under our existing credit agreements and other alternative sources of financing, will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, obligations associated with our restructuring and transformation initiatives, and other operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months.

Uses of Capital 
    
  We did not repurchase any shares in year-to-date 2016.  The remaining authorization under our existing share repurchase program is   $373 million  .  We plan to balance our allocation of capital for open-market share repurchases with allocations for merger and acquisition opportunities. We consider many types of acquisitions for their strategic and other benefits. We plan to focus on acquisitions of business-to-business service providers and companies specializing in categories beyond office supplies. 
    
  We are committed to maintaining our current quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. We paid a dividend of $0.12 per share during the third quarter of 2016, and we expect the total value of quarterly cash dividend payments for fiscal   2016   to be $0.48 per share.  While it is our intention to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends for 2016 and beyond, any decision to pay future cash dividends will be made by our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, financial condition and other factors. 
    
  We expect a moderate decrease in capital spending in   2016   compared with   2015   as we focus spending on strategic priorities.  We expect that operating cash flows will be the primary source of funds for our capital expenditures. 

Inflation and Seasonality 
    
  While neither inflation nor deflation has had, nor do we expect them to have, a material impact upon our consolidated operating results, we may see price increases in certain categories from time to time.  Our business is somewhat seasonal, with sales and profitability historically higher during the second half of our fiscal year due to the back-to-school, holiday and January back-to-business seasons. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , there have been no material changes to the interest rate and foreign exchange risk information disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 30, 2016.  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated, as of   October 29, 2016  , the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, which were designed to be effective at the reasonable assurance level.  The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   October 29, 2016  , management, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level at that date. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   October 29, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time, we are involved in litigation arising from the operation of our business that is considered routine and incidental to our business.  We do not believe the results of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  The risks described in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (the "Form 10-K") and Part II, Item 1A, of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC since the Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.  If any of these risks actually occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline materially and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
