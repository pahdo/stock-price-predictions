1. Overview 
  Basis of presentation 
  Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company  or  Cooper Standard ), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. ( CSA U.S. ), is a leading manufacturer of sealing, fuel and brake delivery, fluid transfer, and anti-vibration systems. The Company s products are primarily for use in passenger vehicles and light trucks that are manufactured by global automotive original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and replacement markets. The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through its subsidiaries. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form  10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Annual Report ), as filed with the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. These financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations of the Company. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. The operating results for the interim period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. In preparing these financial statements, the Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued. 
  Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, and the Company adopted this guidance during the second quarter of 2016. The provisions related to forfeitures were adopted on a modified retrospective basis to record actual forfeitures as they occur in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, and the impact from adoption resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of   $473   to retained earnings. Provisions related to income taxes were adopted prospectively from January 1, 2016, and resulted in a tax benefit of   $3,212   for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Provisions related to the statement of cash flows have been adopted prospectively and result in the recognition of excess tax benefits in cash provided by operating activities.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement - Period Adjustments  . This ASU requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to estimated amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined and not restate prior amounts disclosed. This guidance was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . This ASU amends the consolidation guidance under U.S. GAAP. This guidance was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently issued accounting pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The amendments provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, thereby reducing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The guidance requires companies to use a retrospective transition method upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.   This guidance eliminates the requirement that an investor retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an investment that it had accounted for by another method initially qualifies for the equity method. The guidance requires that an equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest to the

  (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands except per share and share amounts) 

current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . The guidance revises existing U.S. GAAP by requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases (with an exception of short-term leases). This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires companies to use a modified retrospective approach upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . This ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements: Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . This ASU requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The core principle of this guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which delays the effective date of this guidance to annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date of annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The guidance allows for companies to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach when adopting. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  2. Acquisitions  
  AMI Acquisition 
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company acquired the North American fuel and brake business of AMI Industries for cash consideration of   $32,000   (the  AMI Acquisition ). This acquisition directly aligns with the Company's growth strategy by expanding the Company's fuel and brake business. The results of operations of the North American fuel and brake business of AMI Industries are included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, August 15, 2016, and reported within the North American segment. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with the total purchase price allocated on a preliminary basis using information available, resulting in the recognition of goodwill of   $7,175   in the third quarter of 2016. Also in the third quarter of 2016, the Company agreed to purchase the China fuel and brake business of AMI Industries, which is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.  
  Shenya Acquisition 
  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional   47.5%   of Huayu-Cooper Standard Sealing Systems Co. ( Shenya ), increasing its ownership to   95%  , for cash consideration of   $59,320   of which   $34,396   was paid  in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The business acquired in the transaction is operated from Shenya s manufacturing locations in China. Shenya primarily supplies sealing systems and components to the automotive industry. This acquisition is directly aligned with the Company s growth strategy by strengthening important customer relationships in the automotive sealing systems market. The results of operations of Shenya are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, February 27, 2015, and reported within the Asia Pacific segment. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a   47.5%   unconsolidated equity interest in Shenya. The estimated fair value of the equity interest at the date of acquisition was   $41,378  , resulting in a gain of   $14,199   recorded in other (expense) income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company acquired a business in furtherance of the Company's Shenya operations. The total purchase price of the acquisition was   $5,478  , of which the Company made a deposit of   $3,020   during the first quarter of 2016 and issued a note payable for   $2,458   in the second quarter of 2016, which was subsequently paid during July 2016. The Company recognized   $2,972   of goodwill as a result of this acquisition in the second quarter of 2016.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands except per share and share amounts) 

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company obtained control of its   51%  -owned joint venture, Shenya Sealing (Guangzhou) Company Limited ( Guangzhou ) through an amendment of the joint venture governing document. This joint venture was previously accounted for as an investment under the equity method. The results of operations of Guangzhou are included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of consolidation, August 4, 2016, and reported within the Asia Pacific segment. Business combination accounting was completed on a preliminary basis using information available, resulting in the recognition of goodwill of   $10,869   in the third quarter of 2016. There was no gain or loss recognized on the remeasurement of the Company's equity method investment in Guangzhou for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .

Goodwill is tested for impairment by reporting unit either annually or when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. There were no indicators of potential impairment during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Intangible Assets 
  The following table presents intangible assets and accumulated amortization balances of the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively: 

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company acquired intangible assets of   $19,410   in conjunction with the AMI Acquisition.

  Also in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded intangible assets of   $6,605   in conjunction with the consolidation of Guangzhou. This consisted of   $1,313   related to customer relationships and   $5,292   related to land-use right with weighted average amortization periods of approximately   7   and   45   years, respectively. 
  Amortization expense totaled   $3,457   and   $3,599   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $9,974   and   $10,819   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

4. Restructuring 
  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business and objectives to ensure that it is properly configured and sized based on changing market conditions. Accordingly, the Company has initiated certain restructuring initiatives, including plant rationalizations and targeted workforce reduction efforts, as deemed appropriate.  
  In addition to previously initiated actions, in January 2015, the Company announced its intention to further restructure its European manufacturing footprint based on the then current and anticipated market demands. The total estimated cost of this initiative, which is expected to be completed in 2017, is approximately   $125,000  , of which approximately   $78,000   has been incurred to date.  
  The Company previously implemented several other restructuring initiatives, including the closure or consolidation of facilities throughout the world and the reorganization of the Company's operating structure. While substantially complete, the Company continues to incur costs with respect to some of these initiatives, primarily related to the disposal of the respective facilities. 
  The Company's restructuring charges consist of severance, retention and outplacement services, and severance-related postemployment benefits (collectively,  employee separation costs ), other related exit costs and asset impairments related to restructuring activities. 
  The following table summarizes the restructuring expense by segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

6. Debt 
  Outstanding debt consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Term Loan Facility 
  On April 4, 2014, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a Term Loan Facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) in order to (i) refinance the then-outstanding Senior Notes and Senior PIK Toggle Notes, including applicable call premiums and accrued and unpaid interest, (ii) pay related fees and expenses and (iii) provide for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility provides for loans in an aggregate principal amount of   $750,000   and may be increased (or a new term loan facility added) by an amount that will not cause the consolidated first lien debt ratio to exceed   2.25 to 1.00   plus   $300,000  . All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by the direct parent company of the borrower and each existing and subsequently acquired direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary of the borrower. The obligations are secured by amongst other items (a) a first priority security interest (subject to permitted liens and other customary exceptions) on (i) all the capital stock in restricted subsidiaries directly held by the borrower and each of the guarantors (limited to 65% of the capital stock of any foreign subsidiaries), (ii) substantially all plant, material owned real property located in the U.S. and equipment of the borrower and the guarantors and (iii) all other personal property of the borrower and the guarantors, and (b) a second priority security interest (subject to permitted liens and other customary exceptions) in accounts receivable of the borrowers and the guarantors arising from the sale of goods and services, inventory, excluding certain collateral and subject to certain limitations. Loans under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrower s option, LIBOR, subject to a   1.00%   LIBOR Floor plus an applicable margin of    3.00%   or the base rate option (the highest of the Federal Funds rate, plus   0.50%  , prime rate, or one-month Eurodollar rate plus   1.00%  ), plus an applicable margin of   2.00%  . The Term Loan Facility matures on   April 4, 2021  . On April 4, 2014, the aggregate principal amount of   $750,000   was fully drawn to extinguish the Senior Notes and the Senior PIK Toggle Notes and to pay related fees and expenses. Debt issuance costs of approximately   $7,900   were incurred on this transaction, along with the original issue discount of   $3,750  . Both the debt issuance costs and the original issue discount are amortized into interest expense over the term of the Term Loan Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal amount of   $733,125   was outstanding. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2,411   of unamortized original issue discount and unamortized issuance costs of   $5,225  . 
  Senior ABL Facility 
  On April 4, 2014, CS Intermediate Holdco 1 LLC ( Parent ), CSA U.S. (the  U.S. Borrower ), Cooper-Standard Automotive Canada Limited (the  Canadian Borrower ), Cooper-Standard Automotive International Holdings BV (the  European Borrower  and, together with the U.S. Borrower and Canadian Borrower, the  Borrowers ), and certain subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the  Senior ABL Facility ), which amended and restated the then existing senior secured asset based revolving agreement dated May 27, 2010, in order to permit the Term Loan Facility and other related transactions. The Senior ABL Facility provided for an aggregate revolving loan availability of up to   $150,000  , subject to borrowing base availability, including a   $60,000   letter of credit sub-facility and a   $25,000   swing line sub-facility. The Senior ABL Facility also provided for an uncommitted   $105,000   incremental loan facility, for a potential total Senior ABL Facility of   $255,000   (if requested by the borrowers and the lenders agree to fund such increase).  
  On June 11, 2014, the same parties entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Senior ABL Facility, which increased the aggregate revolving loan availability to   $180,000  , subject to borrowing base availability, principally by expanding a tooling receivable category of eligible borrowing base availability for the U.S. borrower and Canadian borrower. The Senior ABL Facility, as amended, also now provides for an uncommitted   $75,000   incremental loan facility, for a potential total Senior ABL Facility of   $255,000   (if requested by the borrowers and the lenders agree to fund such increase). No consent of any lender (other than those participating in the increase) is required to effect any such increase. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility, and subject to borrowing base availability, the Company had   $180,000   in availability less outstanding letters of credit of   $57,084  .

  On November 2, 2016, CSA U.S. issued   $400,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.625%   Senior Notes due 2026 (the  Senior Notes ) and amended its existing Senior ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility (the  Debt Refinancing ). The Company used the proceeds of the Senior Notes to repay the non-extended term loan outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the Debt Refinancing. The remaining term loan of   $340,000   was extended to November 2023. The Senior ABL Facility was extended to November 2021 and its aggregate revolving loan availability increased to   $210,000  , subject to borrowing base availability.  
   
  7. Pension and Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions 
  The following tables disclose the components of net periodic benefit (income) cost for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   for the Company s defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans:

    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands except per share and share amounts) 

The Company made a discretionary contribution of   $6,378   to its U.S. pension plan in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
   
  8. Income Taxes 
  The Company is required to determine its effective tax rate each quarter based upon its estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company is also required to record the tax impact of certain unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances and effects of changes in tax laws or rates, in the interim period in which they occur. In addition, jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year where no tax benefit can be recognized are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. 
  The effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   25%   and   29%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   28%   and   33%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   lower   primarily due to the tax benefits related to the U.S. research tax credit and the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to share-based compensation reflected in the 2016 effective tax rate which was not statutory in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The income tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   varies from statutory rates primarily due to the impact of income taxes on foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the inability to record a tax benefit for pre-tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions to the extent not offset by other categories of income, tax credits, income tax incentives, excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, withholding taxes and other permanent items. Further, the Company s current and future provision for income taxes may be impacted by the recognition of valuation allowances in certain countries. The Company intends to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

  10. Net Income Per Share Attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. 
  Basic net income per share attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was computed by dividing net income attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was computed using the treasury stock method by dividing diluted net income available to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, including the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, using the average share price during the period.  
  A summary of information used to compute basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. is shown below:

The effect of certain common share equivalents was excluded from the computation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding as inclusion would have been antidilutive. A summary of common stock equivalents excluded from the computation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding is shown below: 

11. Share-Based Compensation 
  Under the Company's incentive plans, stock options, restricted common stock, restricted preferred stock, unrestricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance units have been granted to key employees and directors. Total compensation expense recognized was   $7,640   and   $3,384   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18,533   and   $8,348   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  12. Common Stock 
  In March 2016, certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Point Capital, L.P., Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. and Capital World Investors (the  Selling Stockholders ) sold   2,278,031   shares, including overallotments, of the Company s common stock at a public offering price of   $68.00   per share, in a secondary public offering. Of the   2,278,031   shares sold in the offering,   350,000   shares were purchased by the Company for   $23,800  . The Company paid the underwriting discounts and commissions payable on the shares sold by the Selling Stockholders, excluding the shares the Company repurchased, resulting in   $5,900   of fees incurred for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which is included in other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statement of net income. The Company also incurred approximately   $600   of other expenses related to legal and audit services for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which is included in selling, administration   engineering expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of net income. The Company did not sell or receive any proceeds from the sales of shares by the Selling Stockholders.

15. Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tier fair value hierarchy is utilized, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
                 Level 1: 
    Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
      Level 2: 
    Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
      Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates. The Company also considers the risk of non-performance in the estimation of fair value and includes an adjustment for non-performance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments. In certain instances where market data is not available, the Company uses management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value. Fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy level for the Company s liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are shown below: 

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  In addition to items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which are not included in the table above. As these nonrecurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For further information on assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis see Note 2.  Acquisitions  and Note 4.  Restructuring.   
  Items Not Carried At Fair Value 
  Fair values of the Term Loan Facility approximated   $728,209   and   $714,332   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on quoted market prices, compared to the recorded value of   $725,489   and   $729,841   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. This fair value measurement was classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards and swap contracts, to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. For a fair value hedge, both the effective and ineffective, if significant, portions are recorded in earnings and reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of net income. For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. The ineffective portion, if significant, is recorded in other income or expense. When the underlying hedged transaction is realized or the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings and reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of net income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. 
  The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the cash flow hedges. The Company  
  
   18 

    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands except per share and share amounts) 

also formally assesses whether a cash flow hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current assets, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties on its derivative financial instruments. The Company mitigates this credit risk exposure by entering into agreements directly with major financial institutions with high credit standards that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  Forward foreign exchange contracts   The Company uses forward contracts to mitigate the potential volatility to earnings and cash flow arising from changes in currency exchange rates that impact the Company s foreign currency transactions. The principal currencies hedged by the Company include various European currencies, the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, and the Brazilian Real. As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional amount of these contracts was   $62,247  . The amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into cost of products sold was   $769   and   $2,380   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. These foreign currency derivative contracts consist of hedges of transactions up to   June 2017  .  
  Interest rate swaps   - In August 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions to manage cash flow variability associated with its variable rate Term Loan Facility. The interest rate swap contracts, which fix the interest payments of variable rate debt instruments, are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional amount of these contracts was   $300,000   with maturities through   September 2018  . The fair market value of all outstanding interest rate swap and other derivative contracts is subject to changes in value due to changes in interest rates. The amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense, net of interest income was   $803   and   $2,393   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The amount to be reclassified in the next twelve months is expected to be approximately   $2,937  . 
   
  16. Accounts Receivable Factoring 
  As a part of its working capital management, the Company sells certain receivables through third party financial institutions with and without recourse. The amount sold varies each month based on the amount of underlying receivables and cash flow needs of the Company. The Company continues to service the receivables.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $66,901   and   $63,473  , respectively, outstanding under receivable transfer agreements without recourse entered into by various locations. The total amount of accounts receivable factored without recourse was   $188,934   and   $207,432   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Costs incurred on the sale of receivables were   $391   and   $468   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1,286   and   $1,658   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are recorded in other (expense) income, net and interest expense, net of interest income in the condensed consolidated statements of net income. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $6,297   and   $3,433  , respectively, outstanding under receivable transfer agreements with recourse. The secured borrowings are recorded in debt payable within   one year  , and receivables are pledged equal to the balance of the borrowings. The total amount of accounts receivable factored with recourse was   $46,610   and   $27,383   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Costs incurred on the sale of receivables were   $55   and   $38   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $185   and   $115   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are recorded in other (expense) income, net and interest expense, net of interest income in the condensed consolidated statements of net income. 
   
  17. Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is periodically involved in claims, litigation and various legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company conducts and monitors environmental investigations and remedial actions at certain locations. The Company accrues for litigation exposure when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Any resulting adjustments, which could be material, are recorded in the period the adjustments are identified. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for litigation claims and matters, if any, has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable. As such, the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters.

On March 30, 2016, a putative class action complaint alleging conspiracy to fix the price of body sealing products used in automobiles and other light-duty vehicles was filed in Ontario against numerous automotive suppliers, including Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc., CSA U.S. and Cooper-Standard Automotive Canada Limited ( CS Defendants ) and Nishikawa Cooper LLC, a joint venture in which the Company holds a   40%   interest. Plaintiffs purport to be indirect purchasers of body sealing products supplied by the CS Defendants and/or the other defendants during the relevant period. The plaintiffs seek recovery of damages against all defendants in an amount to be determined, punitive damages, as well as pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and related costs and expenses of the litigation. The Company believes the claims asserted against the CS Defendants are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against these claims. Further, the Company does not believe that there is a material loss that is probable and reasonably estimable related to these claims.

Item 2.        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presents information related to the condensed consolidated results of operations of the Company, including the impact of restructuring costs on the Company s results, a discussion of the past results and future outlook of each of the Company s segments, and information concerning both the liquidity and capital resources of the Company. The following discussion and analysis, which should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this report, contains certain forward-looking statements relating to anticipated future financial condition and operating results of the Company and its current business plans. In the future, the financial condition and operating results of the Company could differ materially from those discussed herein and its current business plans could be altered in response to market conditions and other factors beyond the Company s control. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or changes include those discussed elsewhere in this report (see  Forward-Looking Statements  below) and in our   2015   Annual Report (see Item 1A. Risk Factors). 
   
  Business Environment and Outlook 
   Our business is directly affected by the automotive vehicle production rates in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and the South America regions. New vehicle demand is mostly driven by macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives.  
  The global automotive industry remains susceptible to uncertain economic conditions that could adversely impact new vehicle demand. With relative stability in the U.S. economy and indications of improvement in the European economy, global economic sentiment nonetheless remains cautious given continued geopolitical uncertainty, oil supply and demand issues, and fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Ongoing volatility with economic conditions in Brazil and a recent slowing in the pace of economic growth in China, continue to impact light vehicle production volumes.  
  Details on light vehicle production in certain regions for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are provided in the following table: 

Competition in the automotive supplier industry is intense and has increased in recent years as OEMs have demonstrated a preference for stronger relationships with fewer suppliers. There are typically three or more significant competitors and numerous smaller competitors for most of the products we produce. Automotive suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint capable of fully servicing customers around the world will continue to shape the success of suppliers going forward. 
  OEMs have shifted some research and development, design and testing responsibility to suppliers, while at the same time shortening new product cycle times. To remain competitive, suppliers must have state-of-the-art engineering and design capabilities and must be able to continuously improve their engineering, design and manufacturing processes to effectively service the customer. Suppliers are increasingly expected to collaborate on, or assume the product design and development of, key automotive components and to provide innovative solutions to meet evolving technologies aimed at improved emissions and fuel economy. 
  Consolidations and market share shifts among vehicle manufacturers continue to put additional pressures on the supply chain. Pricing and market pressures will continue to drive our focus on reducing our overall cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives, capital redeployment, restructuring and other cost management processes.

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Sales.   Sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $28.1 million  , or   3.4%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to improved volume and product mix in both North America and Asia Pacific, the AMI Acquisition and consolidation of a previously unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of   $5.5 million  , the divestiture of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business, decreased volumes in Europe and customer price reductions.  
  Cost of Products Sold.   Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $11.9 million  , or   1.8%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately   50%    and   51%   of the total cost of products sold for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cost of sales was impacted by higher production volumes in North America and Asia Pacific. These items were partially offset by decreased volumes in Europe and South America, the divestiture of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business and continuous improvement savings.  
  Gross Profit.   Gross profit for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $16.2 million  , or   10.9%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of sales, gross profit was   19.2%   and   17.9%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in gross profit was driven primarily by continuous improvement and material cost savings and improved volume and mix in North America and Asia Pacific. These items were partially offset by customer price reductions and decreased volumes in Europe.  
  Selling, Administration and Engineering.   Selling, administration and engineering expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $92.4 million  , or   10.8%   of sales, compared to   $79.1 million  , or   9.6%   of sales, for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Selling, administration and engineering expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was impacted primarily by higher compensation-related costs, as well as investments to support growth.  
  Restructuring.   Restructuring charges for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.9 million   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Restructuring charges consisted primarily of expenses incurred related to our European restructuring initiative.   
  
   23 

Interest Expense, Net.   Net interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.6 million   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which resulted primarily from interest and debt issuance cost amortization recorded on the Term Loan Facility.  
  Other (Expense) Income, Net.     Other expense   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.5 million  , consisting primarily of   foreign currency losses   of   $0.3 million   and   losses on sales of receivables   of   $0.2 million  .   Other expense   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was   $3.3 million  , which consisted of $3.1 million of   foreign currency losses   and   $0.2 million     losses on sales of receivables  .  
  Income Tax Expense  . Income tax expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $12.5 million   on earnings before income taxes of   $49.2 million  . This compares to income tax expense of   $12.9 million   on earnings before income taxes of   $45.4 million   for the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was lower primarily due to the tax benefits related to the US research tax credit and the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to share-based compensation reflected in the 2016 effective tax rate which was not statutory in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The income tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   varied from statutory rates due primarily to the impact of income taxes on foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the inability to record a tax benefit for pre-tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions to the extent not offset by other categories of income, tax credits, income tax incentives, excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation, withholding taxes, and other permanent items. Further, the Company s current and future provision for income taxes may be impacted by the recognition of valuation allowances in certain countries. The Company intends to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Sales.   Sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $109.1 million  , or   4.4%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to improved volume and product mix in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as our recent acquisitions and consolidation of a previously unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of   $44.8 million  , the divestiture of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business, decreased volumes in South America, and customer price reductions.  
  Cost of Products Sold.   Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, depreciation and amortization and other direct operating expenses. Cost of products sold for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   increased     $45.9 million  , or   2.2%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Materials comprise the largest component of our cost of products sold and represented approximately   50%   of the total cost of products sold for each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Cost of sales was impacted by higher production volumes in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as our recent acquisitions. These items were partially offset by decreased volumes in South America, the divestiture of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business and continuous improvement savings.  
  Gross Profit.   Gross profit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $63.2 million  , or   14.6%   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of sales, gross profit was   19.1%   and   17.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in gross profit was driven primarily by continuous improvement and material cost savings, improved volume and product mix in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and our recent acquisitions. These items were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange, customer price reductions and decreased volumes in South America.  
  Selling, Administration and Engineering.   Selling, administration and engineering expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $268.5 million  , or   10.3%   of sales, compared to   $239.5 million  , or   9.6%   of sales, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Selling, administration and engineering expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was impacted primarily by higher compensation-related costs, as well as investments to support growth.  
  Restructuring.   Restructuring charges for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $1.3 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Restructuring charges consisted primarily of expenses incurred related to our European restructuring initiative.     
  Interest Expense, Net.   Net interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.9 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which resulted primarily from interest and debt issuance cost amortization recorded on the Term Loan Facility.  
  Other (Expense) Income, Net.     Other expense   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $8.6 million  , consisting of secondary offering underwriting fees of   $5.9 million  ,   foreign currency losses   of   $2.0 million  , and   losses on sales of receivables   of   $0.7 million  .   Other income   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $9.9 million  , which consisted of  
  
   24 

the   gain from the remeasurement   of our previously held equity interest in Shenya of   $14.2 million  , partially offset by   $3.5 million   of   foreign currency losses   and   $0.8 million     losses on sales of receivables  .  
  Income Tax Expense  . Income tax expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $43.3 million   on earnings before income taxes of   $151.7 million  . This compares to income tax expense of   $44.1 million   on earnings before income taxes of   $134.2 million   for the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was lower primarily due to the tax benefits related to the US research tax credit and the early adoption of an ASU related to share-based compensation reflected in the 2016 effective tax rate which was not statutory in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The income tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   varied from statutory rates due primarily to the impact of income taxes on foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the inability to record a tax benefit for pre-tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions to the extent not offset by other categories of income, tax credits, income tax incentives, excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation, withholding taxes, and other permanent items. Further, the Company s current and future provision for income taxes may be impacted by the recognition of valuation allowances in certain countries. The Company intends to maintain these allowances until it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.  
  Segment Results of Operations 
    The following table presents sales and segment profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  North America.   Sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $5.6 million  , or   1.2%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the divestiture of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business, customer price reductions and unfavorable foreign exchange of   $1.9 million  , partially offset by an improvement in volume and product mix and the acquisition of AMI Industries' fuel and brake business. Segment profit for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $3.3 million  , primarily due to customer price reductions and higher compensation-related costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of continuous improvement, material cost savings and an improvement in volume and product mix. 
  Europe.   Sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $4.5 million  , or   1.8%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in volume and product mix and customer price reductions, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of   $0.6 million  . Segment loss for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased by   $0.9 million  , primarily due to planned restructuring, a decrease in volume and product mix and customer price reductions, partially offset by the favorable impact of continuous improvement and material cost savings. 
  Asia Pacific.   Sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $35.1 million  , or   34.4%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to improved volume and product mix and consolidation of a previously unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of   $6.2 million  . Segment profit for the   three  
  
   25 

months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $3.7 million   primarily driven by the favorable impact of continuous improvement, material cost savings and an improvement in volume and product mix. 
  South America.   Sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $3.1 million  , or   14.2%  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to favorable foreign exchange of   $2.0 million  . Segment loss for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   improved by   $4.2 million   primarily due to price and material cost savings. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  North America.   Sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $33.9 million  , or   2.6%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an improvement in volume and product mix and the acquisition of AMI Industries' fuel and brake business, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of   $21.1 million  , the divestiture of our hard coat plastic exterior trim business and customer price reductions. Segment profit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $12.9 million  , primarily due to the favorable impact of continuous improvement, material cost savings and an improvement in volume and product mix, partially offset by customer price reductions and higher compensation-related costs.  
  Europe.   Sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $10.0 million  , or   1.3%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an improvement in volume and product mix and favorable foreign exchange of   $1.1 million  , partially offset by customer price reductions. Segment loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased by   $1.1 million  , primarily due to customer price reductions and the non-recurrence of a   $14.2 million   gain on remeasurement of a previously held equity interest in Shenya recognized in the second quarter of 2015 as the legal ownership was held by one of our European entities, partially offset by the favorable impact of continuous improvement, material cost savings and an improvement in volume and product mix. 
  Asia Pacific.   Sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $80.9 million  , or   27.0%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to improved volume and product mix, our recent acquisitions and consolidation of a previously unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of   $17.8 million  . Segment profit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $2.3 million   primarily due to our recent acquisitions, an improvement in volume and product mix, the impact of continuous improvement and material cost savings, partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of expansion in the region.

Sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $15.8 million  , or   20.4%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange of   $7.0 million  . Segment loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   improved by   $3.4 million   primarily due to price and material cost savings, partially offset by decreased volumes. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Short and Long-Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks 
  We intend to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility and receivables factoring. We anticipate that these funding sources will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital needs, debt payments and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants, including borrowing base limitations, under our Senior ABL Facility, depends on our future operating performance and cash flow and many factors outside of our control, including the costs of raw materials, the state of the overall automotive industry and financial and economic conditions and other factors. The Company utilizes intercompany loans and equity contributions to fund its worldwide operations. There may be country specific regulations which may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. See Note 6.  Debt  to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  On November 2, 2016, CSA U.S. issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount of   5.625%   Senior Notes due 2026 (the  Senior Notes ) and amended its existing Senior ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility (the  Debt Refinancing ). We used the proceeds of the Senior Notes to repay the non-extended term loan outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the Debt Refinancing. The remaining term loan of $340,000 was extended to November 2023. The Senior ABL Facility was extended to November 2021 and its aggregate revolving loan availability increased to $210,000, subject to borrowing base availability.  
  Cash Flows 
  Operating Activities.   Net cash   provided by   operations was   $182.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which consisted primarily of positive cash provided from increased cash earnings, partially offset by   $35.2 million   of net cash   used   that related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily a  
  
   26 

result of increased accounts receivables, partially offset by increased accounts payable. Net cash   provided by   operations was   $110.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which included   $63.4 million   of cash   used   that related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.  
  Investing Activities.   Net cash   used in   investing activities was   $150.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which consisted primarily of   $116.8 million   of capital spending and   $37.5 million   for the acquisition of businesses, partially offset by the cash received from the consolidation of a joint venture. Net cash   used in   investing activities was   $163.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which consisted primarily of   $129.7 million   of capital spending and   $34.4 million   for the Shenya acquisition and   $4.3 million   for investment in joint ventures, offset by proceeds of   $4.8 million   for the sale of fixed assets and other. We anticipate that we will spend approximately   $155 million   to   $165 million   on capital expenditures in   2016  . 
  Financing Activities.   Net cash   used in   financing activities totaled   $41.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which consisted primarily of   $23.8 million   for the repurchase of common stock in conjunction with the secondary offering, payments on long-term debt of   $9.8 million  , and taxes withheld and paid on employees' share based awards of   $12.0 million  , partially offset by   $2.5 million   proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants and an increase in short term debt of   $1.7 million  . Net cash   provided by   financing activities totaled   $0.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which consisted primarily of   $8.5 million   related to the exercise of stock warrants and an increase in short term debt of   $1.0 million  , partially offset by payments on long-term debt of   $6.2 million  , taxes withheld and paid on employees' share based awards of   $1.3 million  , and the purchase of noncontrolling interests of   $1.3 million  . 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  In evaluating our business, management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be key indicators of our operating performance. Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 
             
    because similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in our financing arrangements; 
                
    in developing our internal budgets and forecasts; 
                
    as a significant factor in evaluating our management for compensation purposes; 
                
    in evaluating potential acquisitions; 
                
    in comparing our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry; and 
                
    in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board of directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management in their assessments of performance and in forecasting and budgeting for our company. 
     In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, as adjusted for items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, restructuring costs, impairment charges, non-cash fair value adjustments, acquisition related costs, and non-cash stock based compensation. 
  We calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting net income to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measurements recognized under U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not as alternatives for, net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. These limitations include: 

they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; 
                
    they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
                
    they do not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments under our Term Loan Facility and Senior ABL Facility; 
                
    they do not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 
                
    although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and 
     
   27 

other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently and, as the number of differences in the way companies calculate these measures increases, the degree of their usefulness as a comparative measure correspondingly decreases. 
     In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, it should be noted that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the below presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual items. 
  The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net income, which is the most comparable financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP: 

(1) 
    Gain on remeasurement of previously held equity interest in Shenya. 
              (2) 
    Fees and other expenses associated with the March 2016 secondary offering. 
              (3) 
    Amortization of write-up of inventory to fair value for the Shenya acquisition.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws, and we intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbor created thereby. We make forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may make such statements in future filings with the SEC. We may also make forward-looking statements in our press releases or other public or stockholder communications. These forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenue or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, business trends, and other information that is not historical information and, in particular, appear under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,   Risk Factors,  and  Business Environment and Outlook.  When used in this report, the words  estimate,   expect,   anticipate,   project,   plan,   intend,   believe,   forecast,  or future or conditional verbs, such as  will,   should,   could,   would,  or  may,  and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or achievements to be materially different from the future results or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
  There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this report. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others: prolonged or material contractions in automotive sales and production volumes; escalating pricing pressures; loss of large customers or significant platforms; our ability to successfully compete in the automotive parts industry; availability and increasing volatility in costs of manufactured  
  
   28 

components and raw materials; disruption in our supply base; risks associated with our non-U.S. operations; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to control the operations of our joint ventures for our sole benefit; our substantial debt; our ability to obtain adequate financing sources in the future; operating and financial restrictions imposed on us under our term loan facility and the ABL facility; the underfunding of our pension plans; significant changes in discount rates and the actual return on pension assets; effectiveness of our continuous improvement programs and other cost savings plans; manufacturing facility closings or consolidation; our ability to execute new program launches; our ability to meet  customers' needs for new and improved products; the possibility that our acquisition strategy may not be successful; product liability, warranty and recall claims brought against us; environmental, health and safety laws and other laws and regulations; work stoppages or other labor disruptions; the ability of our intellectual property to withstand legal challenges; cyber-attacks or other disruptions in our information technology systems;  the possible volatility of our annual effective tax rate; the possibility of future impairment charges to our goodwill and long-lived assets; the concentrated ownership of our stock which may allow a few owners to exert significant control over us; and our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy our obligations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our   2015   Annual Report for additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties. There may be other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. 
  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable securities laws. 
   
  Item 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  There have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative information about the Company s market risk from those previously disclosed in the Company s   2015   Annual Report. 
   
  Item 4.        Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer along with the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.        Legal Proceedings 
  We are periodically involved in claims, litigation and various legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we conduct and monitor environmental investigations and remedial actions at certain locations. We accrue for litigation exposure when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Any resulting adjustments, which could be material, are recorded in the period the adjustments are identified. As of   September 30, 2016  , management does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for our litigation claims and matters, if any, has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable. As such, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters. 
  On March 30, 2016, a putative class action complaint alleging conspiracy to fix the price of body sealing products used in automobiles and other light-duty vehicles was filed in Ontario against numerous automotive suppliers, including the CS Defendants and Nishikawa Cooper LLC, a joint venture in which the Company holds a   40%   interest. Plaintiffs purport to be indirect purchasers of body sealing products supplied by the CS Defendants and/or the other defendants during the relevant period. The plaintiffs seek recovery of damages against all defendants in an amount to be determined, punitive damages, as well as pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and related costs and expenses of the litigation. The Company believes the claims asserted against the CS Defendants are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against these claims. Further, the Company does not believe that there is a material loss that is probable and reasonably estimable related to these claims.     
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our   2015   Annual Report which could materially impact our business, financial condition or future results. Risks disclosed in the   2015   Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. 
   
  Item 2.        Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  (c) Purchases of Equity Securities By the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
  On March 14, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a securities repurchase program (the  Program ) authorizing the Company to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $125 million of its outstanding common stock or warrants to purchase common stock. The authorization replaces the remaining balance of a previous $50 million repurchase program authorized in May 2013 pursuant to which the Company has repurchased approximately 198,990 shares at a total cost (including fees) of $9.8 million. Under the Program, repurchases may be made on the open market or through private transactions, as determined by the Company s management and in accordance with prevailing market conditions and federal securities laws and regulations. Of the $125 million authorization under the Program, the Company used $23.8 million of cash on hand to purchase 350,000 of the shares being offered by the Selling Stockholders in connection with the secondary offering of the Company s common stock that was completed in March 2016. The Company expects to fund any future repurchases from cash on hand and future cash flows from operations. The Company is not obligated to acquire a particular amount of securities, and the Program may be discontinued at any time at the Company s discretion. No repurchases were made in the current reporting period. Approximately $101.2 million dollar value of shares may yet be purchased under the Program.

COOPER-STANDARD HOLDINGS 
  Special Relative TSR Award Term Sheet 

Type of Award:      Cash-denominated and stock-settled 

Grant Frequency:       One-time, special grant to selected executives 

Vesting:      100% on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued service 

Performance Period:       Three years, beginning on the grant date 

Size of Individual Awards:    Target dollar value as recommended by the CEO 

Performance Goal:      Award is earned if Cooper-Standard s relative total shareholder return ( TSR ) during the Performance Period is above the median of the Comparator Group as defined below 

TSR Calculation Methodology:      As follows: 

TSR Beginning Stock Price Calculation     average closing stock price for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the beginning of the Performance Period (for Cooper-Standard and the Comparator Group) 

TSR Ending Stock Price Calculation     average closing stock price for the last 20 trading days of the Performance Period (for Cooper-Standard and the Comparator Group) 

Treatment of Dividends in TSR Calculation     TSR calculation will assume reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date (for Cooper-Standard and the Comparator Group, where applicable) 

Comparator Group:      The Comparator Group is the subset of companies in Cooper-Standard s 6-digit Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) code (251010   Automobile Components) that have revenues   and   market capitalizations of at least $250M 

Refer to the   Exhibit   for the 26 companies in the Comparator Group along with corresponding size measure detail (size is not as relevant for relative TSR comparisons as it is for benchmarking compensation levels) 

Changes in the Comparator Group During Performance Period:      The Comparator Group will be fixed based on index constituents at the   beginning   of the Performance Period; the following adjustments will apply to ensure a balanced assessment of relative performance: 

Comparator Group companies that are acquired/merged during the Performance Period will be removed when calculating Cooper-Standard s relative TSR percentile rank 

Comparator Group companies that file for bankruptcy during the Performance Period would be treated as the worst performers for purposes of determining Cooper-Standard s relative TSR percentile rank 

Payout/Settlement Details:      If relative TSR is above the median of the Comparator Group, the recipient will receive a number of shares equal to the target dollar value divided by the closing stock price on the vesting date; payout to be made as soon as administratively feasible following the Performance Period 

Tax Deductibility:      The awards would be considered performance-based compensation under IRC Section 162(m) and thus will be tax-deductible to the Company 

Clawback:      Earned awards would be subject to the Company s clawback policy, if applicable 

Termination Provisions:      Forfeiture for termination of service for any reason (other than a change-in-control termination, as noted below) 

Change-in-Control ( CIC )  : Awards convert to time-vested cash upon a CIC and vest on the original vesting date, without pro-ration 

Conversion to time-vested cash occurs assuming target performance if the CIC occurs in the first year of the performance period, otherwise based on relative TSR performance through the CIC date 

Time-vested cash accelerates in the event of an involuntary termination without Cause within 24 months of the CIC date 
                
    If awards are not assumed/substituted by the acquiring, the award will vest immediately, using the same determination of performance indicated in this section above
