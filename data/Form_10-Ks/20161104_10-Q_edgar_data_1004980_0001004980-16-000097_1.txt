NOTES TO THE   CONDENSED   CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

PG E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility   serving   no  rthern and central California.    The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity   and natural gas to customers.    The Utility is primarily regu  lated by the CPUC and the FERC.    In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility s nuclear generation facilities.  

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q is a combined report of PG   E Corporation and the Utility.    PG E Corporation s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PG E Corporation, the Utility, and other wholly own  ed and controlled subsidiaries.      The Utility s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utility and its wholly own  ed and controlled subsidiaries.      All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both PG   E Corporation and the Utility.    PG E Corporation and the Utility   operate in one segment, as the companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis  .  

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the interim period reporting requirements of Form 10-Q and reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of PG E Corporation and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods pre  sented.      The information at December 31, 201  5   in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this quarterly report was derived from the audited Consolidated Balance Sheets in the 201  5 Form 10-K.    This quarterly report should be read in conjunction with the 201  5   Form 10-K.    

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent asse  ts and liabilities.    Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the Utility s      regulatory assets and liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation liabilities, asset retirement obligations, and pension and other postretirem  ent benefit plans obligations.    Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate and reasonable.     A change in management s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such change occurred.   

NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The significant accounting policies used by PG E Corporation and the Utility are discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Form 10-K.  

Variable Interest Entities 

A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whose equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.   

Some of the counterparties to the Utility s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that would generate electricity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility   has a controlling interest or   was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at   September 30,   2016  ,   the Utility   assessed whether it absorbs any of the VIE s expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement, analyzed the variability in the VIE s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most significant to the VIE s performance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility s financial obligation is limited to the amount the Utility pays for delivered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are most significant to the economic per  formance of any of these VIEs.    Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at   September 30,   2016  , it did not consolidate any of them.  

17    

Asset Retirement Obligations  

Detailed studies of the cost to decommission the Utility s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years  in conjunction with the Nuclear Decommission  ing Cost Triennial Proceedings  .    In the first quarter of   2016, the Utility submitted its updated decommission  ing   cost estimate with the CPUC, which reflects an increase of   approximately $  1.4   billion   in the estimated undiscounted cost to decommission the Utility s nuclear power plants.  The change in total estimated cost resulted in an $818 million adjustment to the   ARO   recognized   on the   Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheets.    The adjustment relates to   spent   fuel storage, staffing, and out-of-  state waste disposal   costs  .    Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until   those costs are fully recovered.  T  he Utility requested that the CPUC authorize t  he collection of   increas  ed annual revenue requirements   beginning on January 1  , 2017 based on     these   updated cost estimates.  

On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered into a   joint proposal  with certain parties   to retire Diablo Canyon   nuclear power plant   at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024   (Unit 1)   and 2025   (Unit 2), subject to certain approvals, resulting in an additional $  115   million increase to the ARO recognized   on the   Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheets   in the second quarter of 2016  .      

The estimated   total   nuclear decommissioning cost   of $  4.8   billion   is discounted for GAAP purposes and recognized as an ARO on the   Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheets.      The total nuclear decommissioning obligation accrued in accordance with GAAP was $  3.5   b  illion   at   September 30,  2016   and $2.5 billion at December 31,   2015  .  Changes in these estimates could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

PG E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and cash balance plan.  Both plans are included in  Pension Benefits  below.  Post-retirement medical and life insurance plans are included in  Other Benefits  below. 

The net periodic benefit costs reflected in PG E Corporation s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were as follows:   

(1)   The Utility recorded these amounts to a regulatory account since they are probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers in future rates.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance 

Fair Value Measurement 

In May 2015,   the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  , which standardizes reporting practices related to the fair value hierarchy for all investments for which fair value is measured using   the net asset value per share.  PG E Corporation and the Utility adopted this guidance effective  January 1, 2016 and applied the requirements retrospectively for all periods presented  .    The adoption of this standard did not impact their Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.    All prior periods presented in these Condensed Consolidated financial statements reflect the retrospective adoption of this guidance  .   (See Note 8 below.)    

Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement 

In April 2015, the F  ASB   issued   ASU   No. 2015-05,   Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  , which adds guidance to help entities evaluate the accounting treatment for cloud computing arrangements.  PG E Corporation and the Utility   adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on their Condensed Consolidated F  inancial   S  tatements.    

Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 

In April 2015, the F  ASB   issued   ASU   No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which amends   the   existing   guidance relating to the   presentation of debt issuance costs.  The amendments in this A  SU   require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.    PG E Corporation and the Utility   adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016 and applied the requirements retrospectively for all periods presented.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on their Condensed Consolidated Financial S  tatements.    PG E Corporation and the Utility reclassified $105 million and $103 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2015 with no impact to net income or total shareholders  equity previously reported.    All prior periods presented in these Condensed Consolidated   F  inancial   S  tatements reflect the retrospective adoption of this guidance.       

21    

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted  

Share-based Payment Accounting 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation       Stock Compensation (Topic 718),   which amends the existing guidance relating to the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The ASU will be effective for PG E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2017.  PG E Corporation and the Utility will early adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016 and do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on their   Condensed Consolidated   F  inancial   S  tatements   and related disclosures.  

Recognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities  

In     February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,     Leases (Topic 842),   which     amends the existing guidance relating to the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.        The ASU will be effective     for PG E Corporation and the Utility     on January 1, 2019 with retrospective application.        PG E Corporation and the Utility are currently evaluating the impact the guidance will have on their   Condensed Consolidated   F  inancial   S  tatements   and related disclosures.  

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 

In     January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,     Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which     amends the existing guidance     relating to the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.        The ASU will be effective     for PG E Corporation and the Utility     on January 1, 2018.        PG E Corporation and the Utility are currently evaluating the impact the guidance will have on their   Condensed Consolidated   F  inancial   S  tatements   and related disclosures.  

Revenue Recognition Standard 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which amends   the   existing revenue recognition guidance  .    In August 2015, the FASB deferred   the effective date of this amendment   for public companies   by one year to January 1, 2018  ,   with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date of January 1, 2017.      (See   ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  .)    PG E Corporation and the Utility are currently evaluating the impact the guidance will have on their   Condensed Consolidated F  inancial   S  tatements and related disclosures.  

NOTE 3:   REGULATORY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND BALANCING ACCOUNTS   

Regulatory Assets 

Long-term regulatory assets are composed of the following: 

For more information, see   Note   3   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financ  ial Statements in Item 8 of the   201  5   Form 10-K  .  

22    

Regulatory Liabilities  

Long-term regulatory liabilities are composed of the following: 

For more information, see   Note   3   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financ  ial Statements in Item 8 of the   201  5   Form 10-K  .  

Regulatory Balancing Accounts 

The Utility tracks (1) differences between the Utility s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs and customer billings.  To the extent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months, the Utility records a current regulatory balancing account receivable or payable.        Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as other noncurrent assets   regulatory assets or noncurrent liabilities   regulatory liabilities, respectively, in   the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do not have an   impact on net income  .    Balancing accounts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs are incurred and cu  stomer revenues are collected.    

Current regulatory balancing accounts receivable and payable are comprised of the following: 

23    

The electric distribution, utility generation, and gas distribution balancing accounts track the collection of revenue requirements   approved in the GRC.  Energy procurement balancing accounts track recovery of costs related to the procurement of electricity, including any environmental compliance-related activities.  P  ublic purpose programs balancing accounts are primarily used to record and recover authorized revenue requirements for commission-mandated programs such as energy efficiency and low income energy efficiency.  

NOTE 4: DEBT  

Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program  

The following table summarizes PG E Corporation s and the Utility s outstanding borrowings under their revolving credit facilities   and commercial paper programs at   September 30,   2016  :  

(1)  Includes a $  50   million   lender commitment to the   letter of credit   sublimit   and a $100 million commitment for  swingline  loans defined as loans that are made available on a same-day basis and are repayable in full within 7 days.  

  (2)   Includes a $500 million   lender commitment to the   letter of credit   sublimit   and a $75 million commitment for swingline loans.  

In   June   201  6  , PG E Corporation and the Utility each extended the termination dates of their existing revolving credit faciliti  es by one year from April 27, 2020 to April 27  , 20  21  .  

Other Short-term Borrowings 

I  n March 2016, the Utility   entered into   a $  250   million floating rate unsecured term loan that matures on February 2, 2017.    The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the Utility s outstanding commercial paper.  

Senior Notes   Issuances   

In   March 2016  , the Utility issued $  600   million principal amount of   2.95  % Senior Notes due   March 1, 2026. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the Utility s outstanding commercial paper.   

Variable Rate Interest  

At  September 30,   2016,   the interest rates on the   $  614   million principal amount of pollution control bonds Series 1996 C, E, F, and 1997 B and the related loan agreements   ranged from 0.89% to 0.92%  .  At   September 30,   2016,   the interest rates on the   $  309    million principal amount of pollution control bonds Series 2009 A-D and the related loan agreements   ranged from 0.77% to 0.85%.  Pollution control bonds Series 2009 C and D will mature on December 1, 2016.  

24    

NOTE 5: EQUITY  

PG E Corporation s and the Utility s changes in equity for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016  were as follows:  

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , PG E Corporation sold   0.4   million and   2.6   million shares   of its common stock   under   the February 2015 equity distribution agreement   for cash proceeds of   $  26   million and   $  149   millio  n, respectively, net of commissions paid of $  0.2   million and $  1.3   million  , respectively  .   As of September 30, 2016, the remaining gross sales available under this agreement were $  275   million.   

In August 2016, PG E Corporation sold 4.9 million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering for   net cash proceeds of $309 million.  

PG E Corporation   also   issued common stock under the PG E Corporation 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and share-based compensation plans.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016  ,   5.7   million shares were issued for cash proceeds of $  269   million under these plans.  

NOTE 6: EARNINGS PER SHARE  

PG E Corporation s basic EPS is calculated by dividing the income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  PG E Corporation applies the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation of diluted EPS.  The following is a reconciliation of PG E Corporation s income available for common shareholders and weighted average common shares outstanding for calculating diluted EPS: 

For each of the periods presented above, the calculation of outstanding common shares on a diluted basis excluded an insignificant amount of options and securities that were antidilutive. 

NOTE 7: DERIVATIVES  

Use of Derivative Instruments 

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities.    Procurement costs are recovered through customer rates.  The Utility uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.  Derivatives include   physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.      

25    

Derivatives   are recorded at fair value and   are pres  ented in the Utility s  Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements for each counterparty.  The fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offset exist.     

These instruments are not held for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Utility expects to fully recover in rates all costs related to derivatives as long as the current ratemaking mechanism remains in place and the Utility s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.  Therefore, all unrealized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility s regulatory assets and liabilities on the   Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electricity or the cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.  

The Utility elects the normal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives.  Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that are expected to be used by the Utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commodity delivered.  These   items are not reflected in the Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Eligible derivatives are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting.  

Volume of Derivative Activity 

The volumes of the Utility s outstanding derivatives were as follows: 

(1  )  Amounts shown are for the combined positions of the electric fuels and core gas supply portfolios.  

  (2  )   Million British Thermal Units.  

  (3)   CRRs are financial instruments that enable the holders to manage variability in electric energy congestion charges due to transmission grid limitations.  

Presentation of Derivative Instruments in the Financial Statements 

At   September 30,   2016  , the Utility s outstanding derivative balances were as follows:  

At December 31,   2015  , the Utility s outstanding derivative balances were as follows:  

26    

Gains and losses associated with price risk management activities were recorded as follows:  

(  1)  Unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk-related derivative instruments are recorded to regulatory liabilities or assets, respectively, rather than being recorded to the   Condensed   Consolidated Statements of Income.  These amounts exclude the impact of cash collateral postings.  

  (  2)   These amounts are fully passed through to customers in rates.  Accordingly, net income was not impacted by realized amounts on these instruments.  

Cash inflows and outflows associated with derivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Utility s   Condensed   Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  

The majority of the Utility s derivatives contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility s credit rating from each of th  e major credit rating agencies.    At   September 30,   2016  , the Utility s credit rating was investment grade.    If the Utility s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to   fully   collateralize some of its net liability derivative positions.  

The additional cash collateral that the Utility would be required to post if the credit risk-related contingency features were triggered was as follows:

NOTE 8: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

PG E Corporation and the Utility measure their cash equivalents, trust assets, price risk management instruments, and other investments at fair value.  A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: 

Level     1     Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level     2     Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.   

Level     3     Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.   

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 

27    

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG E Corporation and the   Utility are summarized below. Assets held in rabbi trusts   are held by PG E C  orporation and not the Utility.   

(1)   Includes the effect of the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting agreements and margin cash collateral.  

     (2)   Represents amount before deducting $  346   million, primarily related to deferred taxes on appreciation of investment value.

  (2)   Represents amount before deducting $3  14   million, primarily related to deferred taxes on appreciation of investment value.  

Valuation Techniques 

The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabi  lities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions on the terms and conditions upon which the investments may be redeemed.    Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of th  e end of the reporting period.    There were no material transfers between any levels for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016   and   2015  .  

Trust Assets 

Assets Measured at Fair Value 

In general, investments held in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, cred  it, and market volatility risks. N  uclear decommissioning trust   assets and other trust assets   are composed   primarily of equity and fixed-income   securities   and also include short-term investments that are money market funds valued at Level 1.     

29    

Global e  quity securities primarily include i  nvestments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices   in active markets and are classified as Level 1.   

Fixed-income   securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is determined by observable market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation model, as applicable.  

Assets Measured at NAV   Using Practical Expedient  

On January 1, 2016, PG E Corporation and the Utility adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  and applied it retrospectively for the periods presented in their Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  .      (See Note 2 above.)      In accordance with this guidance,   investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are   composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges   as well as fixed-income securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.    

Price Risk Management Instruments 

Price risk management instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.   

Power purchase agreements, forwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded   futures   that are valued using observable market forward prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded   futures,   or are valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued using observable market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.      

Long-dated power purchase agreements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued using either estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a period for which market data is available.      Market and   credit risk ma  nagement utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility s Level 3 instruments   using   pricing inputs from br  okers and historical data.  

The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISO auction and between auction dates; therefore, the Utility   utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices.    CRRs are   classified as Level 3.  

Level 3 Measurements and Sensitivity Analysis 

The Utility s market and credit risk management function, which reports to the Chief Risk and Audit Officer of the Utility, is responsible for determining the fair value of the Utility s price risk management derivatives.  The Utility s finance and risk management functions collaborate to determine the appropriate fair value methodologies and classification for each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness. 

Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related to Level 3 instruments are expected to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value of these instruments.  (See Note   7   above.)

Financial Instruments 

PG E Corporation and the Utility use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments: 

The fair values of cash, restricted cash, net accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, and the Utility s variable rate pollution control bond loan agreements approximate their carrying values at   September 30,   2016   and December 31,   2015  , as they are short-term in nature or have interest rates that reset daily.    

The fair values of the Utility s fixed-rate senior notes and fixed-rate pollution control bonds and PG E Corporation s fixed-rate senior notes were based on quoted market prices at   September 30,   2016   and December 31,   2015  .    

31    

The carrying amount and fair value of PG E Corporation s and the Utility s debt instruments were as follows (the table below excludes financial instruments with carrying values that approximate their fair values):  

Available for Sale Investments 

The following table provides a summary of available-for-sale investments:

The fair value of   fixed-income   securities by contractual maturity is as follows:  

The following table provides a summary of activity for the   investments  :

NOTE 9: CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  

PG E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation matters   and environmental remediation.    A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG E Corporation s and the Utility s policy is to exclude anticipated legal costs from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred.      The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered into to support its operating activities.      PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of   operations, and cash flows   may be   materially   affected by the outcome of the following matters.  

Enforcement and Litigation Matters 

CPUC Matters 

Order Instituting an Investigation into Compliance with Ex Parte Communication Rules 

During 2014 and 2015, the Utility filed several reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex parte communications that either should not have occurred or that should have been timely reported to the CPUC.  Ex parte communications include communications between a decision maker or a commissioner s advisor and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings.  Certain communications are prohibited and others are permissible with proper noticing and reporting. 

On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Utility should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule 1.1 of the CPUC s Rules of Practice and Procedure governing the conduct of those appearing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications the Utility reported to the CPUC.  The OII also cites the ex parte violations alleged in the City of San Bruno s July 2014 motion, which it filed in CPUC investigations related to the Utility s natural gas transmission pipeline operations and practices.  

On July 12, 2016, the assigned commissioner and ALJ issued a ruling that adopted recommendations included in a process report jointly submitted by the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, ORA, the SED, TURN (together, the  other parties ), and the Utility in April 2016.  The approved framework for resolving the proceeding included a total of 159 communications (the 46 communications already included in the OII and 113 additional communications) in the scope of the proceeding, a procedure for moving undisputed facts into the evidentiary record and a diligence process for providing additional factual information.  The Utility and the other parties disagreed on the inclusion of an additional 21 communications in the scope and filed briefs on the issue.  The ruling confirmed that these additional 21 communications were not included within the scope of the OII and do not, in themselves, appear to be ex parte violations, but granted the other parties  request to seek additional information regarding these communications.   

In a status report jointly submitted to the CPUC on October 14, 2016, the parties proposed an update to the framework for resolving the proceeding.  The revised framework includes a total of 165 communications (159 communications previously included in the proceeding, reduced by two communications the other parties agreed not to pursue, plus 8 additional communications out of 21 communications previously in disagreement).  The parties also proposed to begin settlement discussions on November 30, 2016, followed by a joint status report proposed for January 13, 2017.  In the event a settlement cannot be reached, the parties proposed to submit their opening briefs on January 27, 2017, and reply briefs on February 17, 2017.    On October 31, 2016, the CPUC issued a proposed decision   adopting the schedule   proposed by the parties in the October 14, 20  16 status report.    The proposed decision extends the statutory deadline for this proceeding to May 17, 2017 in order to allow the parties to complete settlement discussions or file briefs, and for the ALJ to prepare and file a proposed decision.      

33    

The Utility expects that the other parties may argue that the number of violations exceeds the 165 communications referenced in the October 14, 2016 joint status report either because a single communication may have violated more than one rule or because they believe some of the material provided during discovery constitutes impermissible ex parte communications.  The Utility expects to contest many of these assertions.  If the matter does not settle, the CPUC will determine which communications included within the scope of the proceeding were in violation of its rules.  The CPUC will also determine whether to impose penalties or other remedies, as a result of a potential settlement or otherwise.  The CPUC can impose fines up to $50,000 for each violation, and up to $50,000 per day if the CPUC determines that the violation was continuing.  The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as how many days each violation continued; the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  The CPUC is also required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.  The CPUC has historically exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations are continuing and the amount of penalties to be imposed.    

PG E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that the CPUC will impose penalties on the Utility in the OII but are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred, because it is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations. 

Finally, the U.S. Attorney s Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General s office also have been investigating matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel.  The Utility is cooperating with these investigations.  It is uncertain whether any charges will be brought against the Utility. 

CPUC Investigation Regarding Natural Gas Distribution Facilities     Record-Keeping  

On November 20, 2014, the CPUC began an investigation into whether the Utility violated applicable laws pertaining to record-keeping practices with respect to maintaining safe operation of its natural gas distribution service and facilities.  The order also required the Utility to show cause why (1) the CPUC should not find that the Utility violated provisions of the California Public Utilities Code, CPUC general orders or decisions, other rules, or requirements, and/or engaged in unreasonable and/or imprudent practices related to these matters, and (2) the CPUC should not impose penalties, and/or any other forms of relief, if any violations are found.  In particular, the order cited the SED s investigative reports alleging that the Utility violated rules regarding safety record-keeping in connection with six natural gas distribution incidents, including the natural gas explosion that occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014.    

On August 18, 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a modified presiding officer s decision (the  MOD POD ) issued on August 17, 2016 in this investigation.  In accordance with the MOD POD, the amount of the fine increased from $24.3 million to $25.6 million, to include a $50,000 fine omitted from the June 1, 2016 presiding officer s decision (the  POD ) and $1.3 million resulting from the per-day fine increase for the missing leak repair records for the De Anza division. With the $10.85 million citation previously paid in 2015 for the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea ( Carmel ) incident, the total fine imposed on the Utility was $36.5 million.  The remaining $25.6 million was paid in September 2016.  

In accordance with the MOD POD, the decision denies the appeals previously filed by the SED and Carmel from the POD, and closes this proceeding but allows the parties an opportunity to request that this proceeding be reopened if needed to ensure proper implementation of a compliance plan to be developed by the parties.   

On September 26, 2016, the SED filed an application for reh  earing of the CPUC s decision.  Specifically, the application   indicates that the CPUC erred in certain of its determinations (including   those   related to maximum all  owable operating pressure   documentation that, if adopted, could result in   an   add  itional fine of $7 million),   calculations (including those  related to the missing De  Anza records violations) and certain other findings, and requests that the CPU  C adopt its recommendations.    On October 11, 2016, the Utility submi  tted its response to the CPUC in which it opposed the SED s application for rehearing arguing that the application failed to identify a legal error warranting rehearing by the CPUC.    The   Utility cannot predict when or   if the C  PUC will grant the rehearing or   if it will ad  opt the SED s recommendations.   

On October 24, 2016, the Utility held a meet and confer with parties to develop remedial measures necessary to address the issues identified in the CPUC decision with the objective of establishing a compliance plan that includes all feasible and cost-effective measures necessary to improve the Utility s natural gas di  stribution system record-keeping.    Under the current schedule, the parties are expected to submit a compliance plan to the CPUC on o  r before   December 16, 2016.  

34    

Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Rights-of-Way      

In 2012, the Utility notified the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address a self-reported violation whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility s pipeline rights-of-way.      The Utility also submitted a proposed compliance plan that set forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachments over a multi-year period and to pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met.      In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey had been completed and that remediation work, including removal of the encroachments, was expected to continue for several years. The SED has not addressed the Utility s proposed compliance plan, and it is reasonably possible that the SED will impose fines on the Utility in the future based on the Utility s failure to continuously survey its system and remove encroachments.  T  he Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the SED s wide discretion and the number of factors that can be considered in determining penalties.  

Potential Safety Citations 

The SED periodically audits utility operating practices and conducts investigations of potential violations of laws and regulations applicable to the safety of the California utilities  electric and natural gas facilities and operations.   The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issue citations and impose fines for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.    The SED   can impose fines up to $50,000 for each violation, per day  , and   can consider the discretionary factors discussed above (see  Order Instituting an Investigation into Compliance with Ex Parte Communication Rules  above) in determining the number of violations and whether to impose daily fin  es for continuing violations.    On September 29, 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting imp  rovements and refinements to its   gas and electric safety   citation   programs.  Specifically, the final decision r  efines the criteria for the SED   to use in determining whether to issue a citation and the amount of penalty, sets an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued, makes self-reporting voluntary in bot  h gas and electric programs,   adopts detailed criteria for the utilities to use to voluntarily self-report a potential violation  ,   and refines other issues in the programs. The decision also me  rges the rules applicable to its   gas and electric safety citation programs into a s  ingle set of rules that replace   the previous safety citation programs and adopts non-substantive changes to these programs so that the programs can be similar in structure a  nd process where appropriate.    The d  ecision closes the proceeding.   

The SED has imposed fines on the Utility ranging from $50,000 to $16.8 million for violations of electric and natural gas laws and regulations.  The Utility believes it is probable that the SED will impose fines or take other enforcement action based on some of the Utility s self-reported non-compliance with laws and regulations or based on allegations of non-compliance with such laws and regulations that are contained in some of the SED s audits.  The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred for fines imposed by the SED with respect to these matters given the wide discretion the SED has in determining whether to bring enforcement action and the number of factors that can be considered in determining the amount of fines. 

In September 2016, the Utility reported that it discovered in November 2015 that approximately 550,000 atmospheric corrosion inspections on above-ground gas distribution meters completed in 2014, which constitute  d   35% of such inspections in 2014, were performed by non-operator qualified personnel.  The Utility did not provide timely notification of su  ch non-compliance to the CPUC.  The SED is investigating the Utility s self-report.   

T  he SED could impose fines on the Utility of up to $50,000 per inspection, and also for failure to timely file a self-report in connection with such inspections  .    The SED has the authority to issue more than one citation for a series of related incidents, and the CPUC can issue an OII and possible additional fines even after t  he SED has issued a citation.    The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could b  e incurred for fines that could be imposed   with respect to this self-report, fo  r the reasons indicated above,   or to predict whether the CPUC will open a formal proceeding as a result of the SED s investigation.

Federal   Matters  

Federal Criminal Trial  

On June 14, 2016, a federal criminal trial against   the   Utility  began in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, on 12 felony counts alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integrity management, and identification of pipeline threats, and one felony count charging that the Utility illegally obstructed the   NTSB   investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident.  On July 26, 2016, the court granted the government s motion to dismiss Count 13 alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully failed to   retain a strength test pressure record with respect to a distri  bution feeder main  , thereby reducing the total number of counts   from 13 to 12.   

On August 2, 2016, the   remaining   Alternative Fines Act sentencing allegations   in the case were dismissed  .  The Alternative Fines Act states, in part:  If any person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss.   (  The remaining allegations related to   $281 million   of gross gains that the government alleged the Utility derived.  As previously disclosed, in   December 2015, the court dismissed the government s allegations regarding the amount of losses.)  

On August 9, 2  016, the jury returned its verdict.  The jury acquitted the Utility on all six of the record-keeping allegations but found the Utility guilty on six felony counts that include one count of   obstructing a federal agency proceeding and   five counts of   violations of   pipeline   integrity management regulations of the   Natural Gas Pipeline   Safety Act.     

On August 16, 2016, the Utility filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for the six counts on which the jury returned a guilty verdict.  The court indicated that it will decide on this motion based on briefs filed by the parties, without oral argument. The Utility is not able to predict when the court will decide on the motion. A sentencing hearing is currently scheduled for January 23, 2017. 

The maximum statutory fine for each felony count is $500,000, for total potential maximum statutory fines of $3 million. At September 30, 2016, the Utility s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include a $3 million accrual in connection with   the jury verdict  .      The Utility also could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, to i  mplement remedial and other measures that could be imposed  , such as a requirement that the Utility s natural gas operations   and/or compliance and ethics programs   be supervised by   an independent   third-party monitor.   If appointed, the Utility expects a monitor would serve for a period of time and report periodically to the court or a department or agency of the government.    

Other Federal   Matters  

In July 2014, the Utility was informed that the U.S. Attorney s Office is     investigating a natural gas explosion that occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014.     The U.S. Attorney s Office in San Francisco also continues to investigate matters relating to the criminal   trial   discussed above.      In addition, in October 2016, the Utility received a grand   jury subpoena and letter from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California advising that the Utility is a target of a federal investigation regarding possible criminal violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and   conspiracy to violate the act.    The investigation involves a removal by the Utility of a hazard  ous   tree that c  ontained an osprey nest and egg   in Inverness, California, on March 18, 2016.    It is uncertain wheth  er any   charges will be brought against the Utility   as a result of these investigations.   

Other Litigation Matters 

Butte Fire Litigation 

In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the  Butte fire ) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.    On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire     released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the   wildfire.      According   to   Cal Fire s report, the   fire bu  rned 70,868 acres, resulted in two   fatalities, and destroyed   549 homes, 368 outbuildings   and four   commercial properties.    Cal Fire s     report concluded that the wildfire was     caused when a Gray Pine tree contacted     the Utility s     electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility     and its vegetation management contractors     to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree.      In a press release also issued on April 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million from the Utility.  

On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California for Sacramento County.      Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.      The California Judicial Council had previously authorized the coordination of all cases in Sacramento County.      As of September 30, 2016, approximately   50   complaints have been filed against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Supe  rior Court of California in the Counties   of Calaveras  ,   San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador   involving approximately   1,850   individual plaintiffs   representing approximately 800   households   and their insurance compani  es.      These complaints are   part of   or are in the process of being added to   the two master complaints.     Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability.    The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may increase in the future.      

The Utility continues mediating and settling preference cases (presented by individuals who due to their age and/or physical condition are not likely to meaningfully participate in a trial under normal scheduling).      The Utility also has begun schedu  ling mediation of other cases.    Case   management   conferences were   held on July 14, 2016     and September 1, 2016.  The   next case management conference is scheduled for December 1, 2016  .     

36    

In connection with this matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest  ,   and attorneys  fees without having been found negligent, through the theory of inverse condemnation.      In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent  .  The Utility believes it was not negligent; however, there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Utility.   

Based on the evidence described in the Cal Fire report that the Gray Pine tree contacted an electric line of the Utility, the Utility believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of $350 million for property damages   (including estimated damages to structures and their contents, and to trees)   in connection with this matter, which corresponds to the lower end of the range of its reasonably estimable losses.      This amount is based on assumptions about the number, size, and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures, the extent of damage to such structures and contents, and other property damage.     The estimate does not include fire suppression costs, personal injury damages and other damages that the Utility could be liable for if it were found to have been negligent  .    

The Utility believes that it is reasonab  ly possible that it will incur   loss  es related to Butte fire claims   in excess of the $350     million accrued through   September   30, 2016  .    The Utility believes that $90 million is a reasonable estimate of fire suppression costs   (this amount is not included in the $350 million accrued through September 30, 2016)  .      The Utility currently is unable to reasonably estimate the upper end of the range because it is   still   at an early stage of the evaluation of claims, the mediation and settlement process, and discovery.        

The process for estimating costs associated with claims relating to the Butte fire, including for estimated property damages, requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors.  As more information becomes known, including discovery from the plaintiffs and results from the ongoing mediation and settlement process, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Butte fire may change, including management s ability to reasonably estimate a range of loss. 

The Utility has liability   insurance from various insurers  , which provides coverage for third-party liability   attributable to the Butte fire.    The Utility records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.      In the second quarter of 2016, the Utility recorded $260   million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with recovery of losses related to the Butte fire, included in Other accounts receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance   Sheets.    The Utility plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, and while the Utility believes that a significant portion of costs incurred for third-party claims (and associated legal expenses) relating to Butte fire will ultimately be recovered through its insurance, it is unable to predict the amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.     

If the Utility records losses in connection with claims relating to the Butte fire that materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in the reporting periods during which additional charges are recorded, depending on whether the Utility is able to record or collect insurance recoveries in amounts sufficient to offset such additional accruals during such reporting periods. 

37    

Other Contingencies   

PG E   Corporation and the Utility are subject to various claims, lawsuits and regulatory proceeding  s   that separately are not considered material  .  Accruals for   contingencies related to such matters (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed above under  Enforcement and Litigation Matters   ) totaled $84   million at   September 30, 2016   and $63 million at Decembe  r 31, 2015.  These amounts are included in O  ther current liabilities in the Condense  d Consolidated Balance Sheets.    The resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.    

Disallowance of Plant Costs 

PG E Corporation and the Utility record a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not be recoverable through rates and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  Capital disallowances are reflected   in operating and maintenance expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income  .  Disallowances as a result of the   CPUC s June 23, 2016 final phase one decision in the Utility s 2015 GT S rate case  , the April 9, 2015 Penalty Decision and the Utility s Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan are discussed below.   

2015 GT S   Rate Case   Disallowance of Capital   Expenditures  

On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved   a final   decision in   phase one of   the Utili  ty s 2015 GT S rate case.      The d  ecision permanently   disallowed a portion of the 2011 through 2014   capital spending in excess of the am  ount adopted and established various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current rate case cycle, including new one-way capital balancing accounts.  As a result, in the second quarter of 2016,   the Utility incurred charges of $190 million for capital expenditures that the Utility believes are probable of disallowance based on   the decision. This included   $134 million   to the net plant balance   for 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts and $56 million for the Utility s estimate of 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts.    Additional charges may be required in the future based on the Utility s ability to manage its capital spending and on the outcome of the third party audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending.   

Penalty   Decision s Disallowance of Natural Gas Capital Expenditures  

On Ap  ril 9, 2015, the CPUC issued a decision in its investigative enforcement proceedings pending against the Utility to impose total penalties of $1.6 billion on the Utility after determining that the Utility had committed numerous violations of laws and regulations related to its natural gas transmission operations   (the  Penalty Decision )  .   In January 2016, the CPUC closed the investigative proceedings.  The total penalty includes (1)   a $300 million fine, (2)   a one-time $400 million bill credit to the Utility s natural gas customers,   (3) $850 million to fund   pipeline safety projects and programs, and (4) remedial measures that the CPUC estimates will cost the Utility at least $50 million.   

On November 1  , 2016, the   assigned ALJ   issued a   phase two   proposed decision in the Utility s 2015 GT S rate case  , which   applies $689 million of the $850 million p  enalty to capital expenditures.    The decision also approves the Utility s list of programs and projects that meet the CPUC s definition of  safety related,  the costs of which are to be funded through t  he $850 million penalty.    The Utility expects a final CPUC decision to be voted in December 2016.  

38    

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Utility recorded charges for disallowed capital spending of $51   million   and $286 million, respectively  ,   as a result of the Penalty Decision.  The cumulative charges at September 30, 2016, and the additional future charges to reach the $1.6 billion total are shown in the following table:  

(1)  The Penalty Decision disallows the Utility from recovering $850 million in costs associated with pipeline safety-related projects and programs that the CPUC will finalize in a final phase two decision to be issued in the Utility s 2015 GT S rate case.  The CPUC recommended in its May 5, 2016 phase one proposed decision in the Utility s 2015 GT S rate case that at least $692 million of the $850 million cost disallowance be allo  cated to capital expenditures.  On November 1, 2016, the CPUC issued a phase two proposed decision in the 2015 GT S rate case which allocates $689 million to capital expenditures.   

  (2  )   Future GT S revenues will be reduced for   these unrecovered expenses.    

  (3  )  In the Penalty Decision, the CPUC estimated that the Utility would incur $50 million to comply with the remedies spec  ified in the Penalty Decision.  This table does not reflect the Utility s remedy-related costs already incurred nor the Utility s estimated future remedy-related costs.  These costs would be expensed as incurred.   

Capital Expenditures Relating to Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan  

The CPUC has authorized the Utility to collect $766 million for   recovery of PSEP capital costs.  As of September 30, 2016  , th  e Utility has spent $1.3   billion   on PSEP-related capital costs, of which $665 million was   expensed   in previous years for costs that are expected t  o exceed the authorized amount.  The Utility expects the remaining PSEP   work to co  ntinue beyond 2016.    The Utility would be required to record charges in future periods to the extent PSEP-related capital costs are higher than currently expected.  

Environmental Remediation Contingencies  

The Utility s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is composed of the following: 

(1)   See  Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites  below.  

The Utility   s environmental remediation liability at   September 30,   2016   reflects its best estimate of probable future costs associated with its final remediation plan.  Future costs will depend on many factors, including the   extent of work   to implement final   remediation plans   and the Utility s required time frame for remediation.    Future changes in cost estimates and the assumptions on which they are based may have a material impact on future financial condition and cash flows.  

39    

At   September 30,   2016  ,   the Utility expected to recover $  704   m  illion of its environmental remediation liability through various ratemaking mech  anisms authorized by the CPUC.  Some of the   Utility   s   environmental remediation   liability, such as the environmental remediation costs associated with the Hinkley site discussed below, will not be   recove  red   in rates.  

Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites 

The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility s natural gas compressor stations.  One of these stations is located near Hinkley, California and is referred to below as the  Hinkley site.   Another station is located near Needles, California and is referred to below as th  e  Topock site.   The Utility   also   is   required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.  

Hinkley Site 

The Utility has been implementing interim remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume and to monitor and control movement of the plume.   The Utility s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the Regional Board.     O  n   November 4,   201  5  , the Regional Board   adopted   a final   clean-up and abatement order   to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the po  tential environmental impacts.    The   final order states that the Utility must   continue and   improve its remediation efforts,   define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action.    Additionally, the final order requires   set  ting   plume capture requirements,   requires   establish  ing   a monitoring and reporting program  , and finalizes   deadlines for the Utility to meet interim cleanup targets.    

Topock Site 

The Utility s remediation and abatement efforts   at the Topock site   are subject to the regulatory authority of the   DTSC and the   D  OI.  I  n   November   201  5  , the Utility submitted its final remediation   design   to the agencies for approval.  The Utility s   design   proposes that the Utility construct an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic and non-soluble form of chromium.  The DTSC is conducting an additional environmental review of the proposed   design  , and the Utility anticipates that the DTSC s draft environmental impact report will be issued for public comment in   early 2017  .  After the DTSC considers public comments that may be made, the DTSC is expected to issue a final environmental impact report in   mid-2017  .  After the Utility modifies its   design   in response to the final report, the Utility   will   seek approval to begin construction of the new in-situ treatment system in   late   2017   or early 2018  .  

Reasonably Possible Environmental Contingencies 

Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the Utility s undiscounted future costs could increase to as much as $  2.0   billion (including amounts related to the Hinkley and Topock sites described above) if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if th  e other potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations  ,   financial condition  ,   and cash flows   during th  e period in which they are recorded.  

Nuclear Insurance  

In addition to the nuclear insurance the Ut  ility maintains through the   NEIL, the Utility also is a member of the   EMANI  , which provides excess insurance coverage for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by th  e Utility if a nuclear or non-     nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon.     

If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.      If NEIL were to exercise this assessment, the current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility is approximately $6  0   million.      EMANI provides $200 million for any one accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility s NEIL policies.   If EMANI losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $2.1 million.      For more information about the Utility s NEIL coverage, see Note 1  3   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K.     

40    

Resolution of Remaining Chapter 11 Disputed Claims  

Various electricity suppliers filed claims in the Utility s proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energy supplied to the Utility s customers between May 2000 and June 2001.      The Utility has entered into a number of settlement agreements with various electricity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and to resolve the Utility s refund claims agains  t these electricity suppliers.   Generally, any net refunds, claim offsets, or other credits that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through settlement or through the conclusion of the various FERC and judicial proceedings are refunded to customers through rates in future periods.  

On September 2, 2016, the Utility s settlement became effective resolving, among other matters, the Utility s claim against the CAISO for $165 million, which includes receivables and interest.      Additionally, the Utility agreed to release $66 million of cash from escrow to the California Power Exchange.  The settlement resulted in a $231 million reduction to the Disputed claims and customer refunds balance on  the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The settlement agreement did not result in a refund to customers or an impact to net income.        

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $233 million and $454 million in net claims within Disputed claims and customer refunds as well as $161 million and $228 million of cash in escrow within Restricted cash.  On October 13, 2016, the Utility received approval from the bankruptcy court to release the remaining cash held in escrow to unrestricted cash for use by the Utility. 

Tax Matters 

PG E Corporation s and the Utility s unrecognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months due to the resolution of several matters, including audits.    As of   September 30,   2016  , it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $  70   million within the next 12 months  .  PG E Corporation and the Utility believe that the majority of the decrease will not impact net income  .  

Purchase Commitments  

In the ordinary course of business, the Utility enters into various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity; natural gas supply, transportation, and storage; nuclear fuel supply and services; and various other commitments.    At December 31, 2015, t  he Utility   had  undiscounted future expected obligations   of approximately $50 billion.  (See   Note 1  3   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financ  ial Statements in Item 8 of the   201  5   Form 10-K  .  )      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Utility entered into several renewable energy power purchase agreements that were approved by the CPUC and completed major milestones with respect to construction, resulting in additional commitments of approximately $406 million over the next 20 years.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  

                RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OVERVIEW  

PG E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility   serving   northern and central California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.   

The Utility is regulated primarily by the CPUC and the FERC.  The CPUC   has jurisdiction over the rates,   terms  ,   and conditions of service for the Utility s electricity and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transportation and storage.  The FERC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions of service governing the Utility s electric transmission operations and interstate natural gas transportation contracts.  The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility s nuclear generation facilities.  The Utility   is   also  subject to the jurisdiction of other federal, state, an  d local governmental agencies.  

This is a combined quarterly report of PG E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with each company s separate Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report.  It should also be read in conjunction with the 201  5   Form 10-K.

Summary of Changes in Net Income and Earnings per Share 

The following table is a summary reconciliation of the key changes,   after  -tax, in PG E Corporation s income available for common shareholders and EPS   (as well as earnings from operations and EPS on an earnings from operations basis)   compared to the same period in the prior year (see  Results of Operations  below).        Earnings from operations      is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income available for common shareholders less items impacting comparability.         Items impacting comparability      represent   items that management does not consider part of the normal course of operations   and affect comparability of financial results between periods  ,   including certain pipeline related expenses, certain legal and regulatory related expenses, fines and penalties, Butte fire related costs, and impacts of the 2015 GT S rate case  .      PG E Corporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes including internal b  udgeting and forecasting, short   and long-term operating plan  ning  , and   employee incentive compensation  .      PG E Corporation believes that earnings from operations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance  .  E  arnings from operations   are not a substitute or alternative for   GAAP measures such as income av  ailable for common shareholders   and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other   companies.  

(1)    All amounts presented in the table above are tax-adjusted at PG E Corporation s tax rate of 40.75% except for fines, which are not tax deductible.  See footnote (7) below.  

(2  )     Earnings from operations  is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and excludes the items impacting comparability shown in   footn  otes (6)   through   (10).  

(  3  )      Represents the incremental authorized revenue collected through rates beginning August 1, 2016 in accordance with the final phase one decision in the Utility s 2015 GT S rate case   during the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016.     

(  4  )      Represents the timing of taxes reportable in quarterly financial statements.  

(  5  )      Represents the gain recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 201  5  .   No comparable gain was recognized in 2016.  

43    

(6)  T  he Utility accrued charges of   $350 million (before the tax impact of $143 million) for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , related to estimated property damages in connection with the Butte   fire, partially offset by   $260 million (before the tax impact of $106 million)   recorded   as probable insurance recoveries   recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016.      No additio  nal charges or recoveries were   recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to third-party claims.      The Utility also incurred charges of $16 million (before the tax impact of $7 million) and $96 million (before the tax impact of $39 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, for Utility clean-up, repair, and legal costs associated with the Butte fire.    

(7)   Represents the impact of the Penalty Decision and other enforcement and litigation matters (see Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   the Utility incurred costs of $59   million (before the tax impact of $2  3   million) and $294 million (before the tax impact of $119 million), respectively,   associated with   estimated safety-related cost disallowances imposed by the CPUC   in its   Apr  il 9, 2015 decision   in the gas transmission pipeline in  vestigations.    Specific projects to be disallowed will be determined in   the   phase two decision of the 2015 G  T S rate   case.    In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Utility accrued fines  , which are not deductible for tax purposes,   of $1 million and $26 million, respectively, in connection with the MOD POD in the CPUC s investigation regarding natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping pra  ctices   and of $3 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the federal criminal trial  .  In the three   and nine   months ended September 30, 2016, the Utility also recorded $4 million (before   the tax impact of $2 million)  , for   probable   disallowance   that will be   imposed for prohibited   ex parte   communications.      

(8  )  Th  e Utility incurred costs of $  31   million (  before the tax impact of $13   million) and $  80   million (  before the tax impact of   $  33 million)   during the three and   nine months ended September   30, 2016, respectively, for pipeline related expenses incurred in connection with the multi-year effort to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way.      

(9  )   T  he Utility incurred costs of $  23   million (  before the tax impact of   $  9   million) and $  54   million (  before the tax impact of $22 million)   during the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, respectively, for legal and regulatory related expenses incurred in connection with various enforcement, regulatory, and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications  .  

(10  )  Represents charges of $190 million (before the tax impact of $77 million) of   probable  capital  disallowance  s  as a result of the final  phase one   2015 G  T S   rate case   decision that the Utility incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , including $  134   million   (before the tax impact of $54 million)   for 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts and $  56   million   (before the tax impact of $23 million)   for the Utility s estimate of 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts.      No additional charges or recoveries were recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016.     (S  ee    Regulatory Matters      below for   more   information.)  

Key Factors Affecting Financial Results 

PG E Corporation and the Utility believe that their future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows will be materially affected by the following factors: 

The Outcome of Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters  .    The Utility s future financial results may continue to be impacted by   current and future enforcement, litigation and regulatory matters and their outcome, including   potential remedial   and other   measures or designation of   one or more   independent third-party monitor  (s)  as a result of the federal criminal trial and debarment proceeding,   potential fines associated with the alleged violations of the CPUC s ex parte communication rules, litigation claims related to the Butte fire  , and a number of investigations and/or requests for information by government agencies,   including in connection with the Utility s self-report related to its atmo  spheric corrosion inspections.    (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.)   

The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking Proceedings.      There are several rate cases that are currently pending at the CPUC and the FERC.  The CPUC approved 2015 GT S  interim  revenue requirements in its final phase one decision dated June 2  3, 2016.    The authorized revenue requirements are effective r  etroactive to January 1, 2015.    However, the Utility will not be able to record the full revenue requirement increase since January 1, 2015 until after the final phase two decision is issued.    On Novembe  r 1, 2016, the assigned ALJ   issued a phase two proposed decision in the 2015 GT S rate case that applies $689 million of the $850 million San Bruno Penalty disallowance to capital expenditures  .    (See  Regulatory Matters   2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case  below for more   information.)  Additionally, o  n August   3,   2016, the Utility and other intervening parties filed a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement in the Utility s 2017 GRC. The settlement agreement proposes a revenue requirement increase of $88 million for 2017.  Under the current   schedule, a final CPUC decision is expected in February 2017.   (See  Regulatory Matters   2017 General Rate Case  below for more information.)      In addition,   o  n July 29, 2016, the Utility filed a rate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement  .    The FERC accepted the Utility s filing on September 30, 2016 and set the proceed  ing for settlement negotiations.    (See  Regulatory Matters     FERC Transmission Owner Rate Cases    below for more information.)  The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties, potential rate impacts, the Utility s reputation, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors.   

The   Ability of the Utility to Control and Recover Operating   Costs and Capital Expenditures.    The Utility is committed to delivering safe, reliable, sustainable and affordable electric and   gas services to its customers.    Increasing demands from state laws and policies relating to increased renewable energy resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the expansion of energy efficiency programs, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, and the development of energy storage technologies have increased pressure on the Utility to achieve     

44    

efficiencies in its operations in order to maintain the   affordability of its service.    In any given year the Utility s ability to earn its authorized rate of return depends on its ability to manage costs within the amounts authorized in rate case decisions.      The Utility forecasts that in 2016 it will incur unrecovered pipeline-related expenses ranging from $100 million to $150 million which primarily relate to costs to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights-of-way.  Also, the June 23, 2016 final phase one CPUC decision in the Utility s 2015 GT S rate case establishes various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the rate case cycle. The ultimate amount of unrecovered costs also could be affected by how the CPUC   determines in its   final phase two   decision of the 2015 GT S rate case which costs are included in determining whether the $850 million shareholder-funded obligation under the Penalty Decision has been met.   (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.)   

The Amount and Timing of the Utility s Financing Needs  .  PG E Corporation contributes equity to the Utility as needed to maintain the Utility s CPUC-authorized capital structure.    F  or the nine months ended September 30, 2016, PG E Corporation issued $742 million of common stock and used $740 million of the cash proceeds to make equity contributions to the Utility.  PG E Corporation forecasts that it will continue issuing a material amount of equity in future years to support the Utility s capital expenditures.  PG E Corporation may issue additional equity to fund unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses and to pay fines and penalties that may be required by the final outcomes of pending enforcement matters.  These additional issuances would have a material dilutive impact on PG E Corporation s EPS.  PG E Corporation s and the Utility s ability to access the capital markets and the terms and rates of future financings could be affected by the outcome of the matters discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, changes in their respective credit ratings, general economic and market conditions, and other factors.    

For more information about the   factors and   risks that could affect future   results of operations,   financial condition, and cash   flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results,   see    Item 1A. Risk Factors   in the 2015 Form 10-K and in Part II below under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  .      In addition, t  his   quarterly r  eport contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management s judgment and opinions which are based on current estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regard  ing these events and management   s knowledge of facts as of the date of this report.  See the   section entitled  Forward-Looking Statements  below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.    PG E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results   and   do not undertake an obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether in response to new informati  on, future events, or otherwise.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

PG E Corporation 

The consolidated results of operations consist primarily of balances related to the Utility, which are discussed below.    The   following   table provides   a summary of net income available for common shareholders for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30,   2016   and   2015  :  

PG E Corporation s net income primarily consists of interest expense on long-term d  ebt,   income taxes, and   other income from investments.    Results   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015   include approximately $30 million of realized gains and associated tax benefits related to an investment in SolarCity Corporation   with no corresponding gains for the same period in 2016  .  

45    

Utility  

The tables below shows certain items from the Utility s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30,   2016   and   2015  .  The tables separately identify the r  evenues   and costs   that impact  ed   earnings   from those that did   not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers   (such as costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs)  ,   and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover those pass-through costs, do not impact earnings.  In addition, expenses that   have been specifically authorized   (  such as the payment of pension costs  )   and the corresponding revenues the Utility is authorized to collect to recover such costs  , do not impact earnings.  

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility s costs to own and operate its assets and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on   rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those   that the Utility incurs to own and operate its assets.  

The Utility s operating results for the three and nine months ended   September 30,   2016 and 2015 reflect charges associated with the impact of the Penalty Decision.  (See  Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings  below.)  

(1)   These items impacted earnings for the three months ended   September 30,   2016   and   2015  .  

46    

(1)   These items impacted earnings for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   2016   and   2015  .  

Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings 

The following discussion presents the Utility s operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   2016   and   2015  , focusing on revenues and expenses that impact  ed   earnings for these periods.      

The Utility   has   received a   final phase one   decision   in   its 2015 GT S rate case  .  This decision authorized the revenue requirements that the Utility began to collect through rates beginning August 1, 2016 for the 2015 GT S rate case period  .    The Utility will collect, over a 36 month period, the difference between adopted revenue requirements and amounts previously collected in rates, retroactive to January 1, 2015.    However, the Utility will not be able to recognize   the full impact of revenues retroactive to January 1, 2015 until the CPUC issues a final phase two   de  cision in this rate case.  In addition, accounting rules preclude the Utility from recording the full amount of the revenue requirement increase until 2017.     (See    Regulatory Matters    below.)      

Operating Revenues 

The Utility s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings   increased by   $  284   million  ,   or   12%  ,   and by $  550   million, or   8%  , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015   primarily due to additional base revenues     authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and in the 2015 GT S rate case as discussed above, and     by     the FERC in the TO rate case.   (See  Regulatory Matters  below.)  

Operating and Maintenance  

The Utility s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased by $  147   million, or   12%  , in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to   escalation related to   labor, benefits, and service contracts,   and   accelerat  ed   transm  ission and distribution project work  .  In addition, the Utility incurred $16 million in charges related to the Butte fire and $4 million in charges recorded in connection with the MOD POD related to the natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping investigation and the federal criminal trial during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  These increases were partially offset by approximately $90 million of lower disallowed capital charges related to the Penalty Decision compared to the same period in 2015.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)  

47    

The Utility s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased   by $  561   million, or   14%  , in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to   escalation related to   labor, benefits, and service contracts,   and   accelerat  ed   transm  ission and distribution project work  .  In addition, the Utility incurred $446 million in charges related to the Butte fire, $190 million in permanently disallowed capital spending (see  Regulatory Matters  below), $50 million in costs related to a scheduled nuclear refueling outage at Diablo Canyon,   and   $29 million in charges recorded in connection with the MOD POD related to the natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping investigation and the federal criminal trial during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These increases were partially offset by $500 million in charges associated with the Penalty Decision for fines and customer refunds incurred in the first nine months of 2015 with no corresponding charges in 2016.  Additionally, the Utility recorded approximately $260 million in probable insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $49 million of insurance recoveries for third-party claims related to the San Bruno accident for the same period in 2015.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)   

The Utility s future financial statements will continue to be impacted by additional charges associated with the Penalty Decision, costs related to the Butte   f  ire, and unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses.  (See  Key Factors Affecting Financial Results  above and Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)       

Depreciation, Amortization, an  d Decommissioning  

The Utility s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses   increased by   $  41   million  ,   or   6%  , and by $  155   million, or   8%  , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same per  iod  s   in 2015.    These   increase  s   w  ere     primarily due to the     impact of capital     additions     as authorized by   the   CPUC in the 2014 GRC decisio  n  .  

Interest Expense  

The Utility s   interest expense  increased by   $  18   million  ,   or   9%  , and by $  47   million, or   8%  , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same per  iod  s   in 2015.    These   increase  s   w  ere     primarily   driven by higher levels of long term debt and short term borrowings in 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.   

Int  erest Income   and Other Income, Net  

There were no mate  rial changes to interest income     and other income,     net for the periods presented.  

Income Tax   Provision   

The income tax   provision increased   by $  1   million  in the three months ended   September   30, 2016   and decreased by   $  194   million in   the nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015.    The following describes the changes in the Utility s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015:  

The effective tax rates for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 were 16% and 19  %, respectively.   The   decrease   in the effective tax rate was primarily   due to higher  benefits resulting from various property-related tax deductions recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 with lower comparable amounts in the three month period ending September 30, 2015  .      

The effective tax rates for th  e nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were (16)% and 12  %, respectively.      The   decrease   in the e  ffective tax rate was primarily due to higher  benefits resulting from various property-related tax deductions recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with lower comparable amounts in the nine month period ending September 30, 2015, as well as  benefits resulting from various tax audit results recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with no comparable amounts in the nine month period ending September 30, 2015.  

48    

Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings   

Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by electricity and natural gas procurement costs.  See below for more information. 

Cost of   Electricity  

The  Utility s cost of electricity includes the costs of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its own generation facilities, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.  (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)    

(  1  )  Average cost of purchased power for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the same periods in 2015   primarily   due to a higher percentage of renewable energy resources  .      

  (2)   The decrease in purchased power   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulted from an increase year-to-date in generation from the Utility s own generation facilities and lower electric customer demand.  Hydroelectric generation increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015.  

The Utility s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, the availability of the Utility s own generation facilities (including the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation power plant and hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source of electricity. 

Cost of Natural Gas 

The Utility s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage, transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.      (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)      The Utility s cost of natural gas is impacted by the market price of natural gas, changes in the cost of transportation and storage, and changes in customer demand.     

(2)   Average cost of natural gas sold   was primarily   impacted by   fluctuations in the market price of natural gas in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015  .  

Operating   and Maintenance   Expense  s  

The Utility s operating expenses also include certain recoverable costs that the Utility incurs as part of its operations such as pension contributions and public purpose programs costs.      If the Utility were to spend over authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact on earnings.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES  

Overview 

The Utility s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, and make distributions to PG E Corporation depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets.      The CPUC authorizes the Utility s capital structure, the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue, and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect to recover its   cost of capital  .  The Utility generally utilizes equity contributions from PG E Corporation and long-term senior unsecured debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock.      The Utility relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.     

PG   E Corporation s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility, and pay dividends primarily depends on the level of cash distributions received from the Utility   s   and PG E Corporation s access to the capital and credit markets.  PG E Corporation has material stand-alone cash flows related to the issuance of equity and long-term debt, dividend payments, and issuances and repayments under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.  PG E Corporation relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.         

PG E Corporation s equity contributions to the Utility are funded primarily t  hrough common stock issuances. PG E Corporation forecast  s that it will issue approximately $800 million in common stock during 2016   and bet  ween $400 million and $600 milli  on during 2017  , primarily to fund equity contributions to the Utility.  The Utility s equity needs will continue to be affec  ted by   the timing and outcome of the final phase two decision in the 2015 GT S rate case, by   unrecover  able pipeline-related expenses  ,   and by fines,   penalties   and claims   that may be imposed in connection   with the matters described in  Enforcement and Litigation Matters  below.  Common stock issuances by PG E Corporation to fund these needs would have a material dilutive impact on PG E Corporation s EPS.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG E Corporation and the Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.  In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Utility holds restricted cash that primarily consists of cash held in escrow pending the resolution of the remaining disputed claims that were filed in the Utility s reorganization proceedings under Chapter   11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  As part of the settlement approved in the third quarter of 2016, the Utility agreed to release $66 million of cash from escrow to the California Power Exchange.  Additionally, on October 13, 2016, the Utility received approval from the bankruptcy court to release the remaining $161 million of cash held in escrow to unrestricted cash for use by the Utility.    (See  Resolution of Remaining Chapter 11 Disputed Claims  in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Cons  olidated Financial Statements.)   

Financial Resources  

Debt and Equity Financings    

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016, PG E Corporation sold   0.4   million   and   2.6   million   shares   of its common stock   under   the February 2015 equity distribution   agreement for cash proceeds of $  26   million   and $  149   million, respectively  , net of commissions paid of   $  0.2   million and   $  1.3   million  , respectively  .   As of   September 30  , 2016, the remaining gross sales av  ailable under this agreement were   $  275   million.   

In August 2016, PG E Corporation sold   4.9   million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering for net cash proceeds of $  309   million.  

PG E Corporation   also   issued common stock under the PG E Corporation 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and share-based compensation plans.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016,   5.7  million shares were issued for cash proceeds of $  269   million under these plans.  

The proceeds from these sales were used for general corporate purposes, including the contribution of e  quity to the Utility.  For the nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016, PG E Corporation made equity contributions to the Utility of $  740   million.   

50    

In     March 2016, the Utility issued $  600   million principal amount of     2.95% Senior Notes due     March 1, 2026. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the Utility s outstanding commercial paper. In addition, in March 2016, the Utility entered into a $  250   million floating rate unsecured term loan that matures on February 2, 2017.        The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the Utility s outstanding commercial paper.  

Revolving Credit Facilities   and Commercial Paper Program  

In   June   201  6  , PG E Corporation and the Utility each extended the termination dates of their existing revolving credit faciliti  es by one year from April 27, 2020 to April 27  , 20  21  .       At   September 30  , 2016, PG E Corporation and the Utility ha  d $  135   million and $  2.2   billion available under their respective $300 million and $3.0 billion revolving credit facilities.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)  

PG E Corporation and the Utility can issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $1.75 billion, respectively.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, PG E Corporation and the Utility had an average outstanding commercial paper balance of $  76   million and $  869   million, and a maximum outstanding balance of $  176   million and $  1.4   billion, respectively.  At September 30, 2016, PG E Corporation and the Utility had an outstanding commercial paper balance of $  165   million and $  731   million, respectively.  

The revolving credit facilities require that PG E Corporation and the Utility maintain a   ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at most 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter.  At   September   30, 2016, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization was   51  % and   49  %, respectively.   PG E Corporation s revolving credit facility agreement also requires that PG E Corpo  ration own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the common stock and at least 70% of the voting capital stock of the Utility.  In addition, the revolving credit facilities   include usual and customary provisions regarding events of default and covenants including covenants limiting liens to those permitted under PG E Corporation s and the Utility s senior note indentures, mergers, and imposing conditions on the sale of all or substantially all of   PG E Corporation s   and the Utility s assets and other fundamental changes.  At   September 30  , 2016, PG E Corporation and the Utility were in compliance with all covenants under their respective revolving credit facilities.  

Dividends  

In May 2016, the Board of Directors of PG E Corporation and the Utility each adopted a new target dividend payout ratio range of 55% to 65% of earnings, with a target to reach a payout ratio of approximately 60% by 2019.  Each Board of Directors retains authority to change the respective common stock dividend policy and dividend payout ratio at any time, especially if unexpected events occur that would change its view as to the prudent level of cash conservation.  No dividend is payable unless and until declared by the applicable Board of Directors. 

In   September   2016, the Board of Directors of PG E Corporation declared quarterly dividends of $0.4  9   per share, totaling $  248   million, of which approximately $  243   million was paid on   October 15,   2016, to shareholders of record on   September 30  , 2016.    

In   September   2016, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock dividend of $  244   million that was paid to PG E Corporation on   October 3  , 2016.  

In   September   2016, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock, payable on   November 15,   2016, to shareholders of record on   October 31, 2016  .  

Utility Cash Flows 

The Utility s cash flows were as follows: 

51    

Operating Activities  

The Utility s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist   of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities   in  creased by $  274   million c  ompared to th  e same period in 2015.  This in  crease was primarily due to   tax refunds of $151 million received during 2016 compared to no tax refunds received or tax payments made during 2015.    The remaining increase was primarily due to fluctuations in activities within the normal course of business such as the timing and amount of customer billings and collections and vendor billings and payments.  

Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including:  

the timing and amounts of   costs that may be incurred in connection with potential remedial and other measures that may be imposed on the Utility as a result of the jury s verdict in the federal criminal trial and in connection with the DOI debarment proceeding, and   fines or penalties that may be imposed in connection with the remaining investigations and other enforcement and litigation matters   and the timing and amount of related insurance recoveries   (see Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements);  

the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, including of a final phase two decision in the 2015 GT S rate case  ,   the 2017 GRC  , and the TO rate cases  ;  

the timing and amount of costs the Utility incurs, but does not recover, associated with its natural gas system; 

the timing and amount of tax payments (including the bonus depreciation), tax refunds, net collateral payments, and interest payments; and 

t  he timing of the resolution of the Chapter 11 disputed claims and the amount of principal and interest on these claims that the Utility will be required to pay.  

Investing Activities 

Net cash   used   in investing activities increased   by $  349   million during t  he   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  The Utility s investing activities primarily consist of construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and natural gas services to its customers.  Cash used in investing activities also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trust investments which are largely offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioning trust investments.  The funds in the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling the Utility s nuclear generation facilities.  

Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur   approximately  $5.7   billion in capital expenditures in 2016 and   approximately $6.0 billion in each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019  .      

Financing Activities 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016  , net cash   provided   by financing activities in  creased   by   $  77   million c  ompared to the same period in 2015.  Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existing debt instruments.  The Utility generally utilizes long-term debt issuances and equity contributions from PG E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure, and relies on short-term debt to fund temporary financing needs.   

52    

ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION MATTERS  

PG E Corporation and the Utility have   significant   contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to   the   enforcement and litigation matters   described in   Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s future financial results.    In addition, PG E Corporation and the Utility are involved in other enforcement and litigation matters described in the 2015 Form 10-K   and  Part II. Other Information, Item 1. Legal Proceedings  .       Significant regulatory developments that have occurred since the 2015 Form 10-K was filed with the SEC are discussed below.  

Department of Interior Inquiry 

In September 2015, the Utility was notified that the DOI had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs citing the San Bruno explosion and indicating, as the basis for the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, poor identification and evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB s investigation.  The Utility filed its initial response on November 2, 2015 to demonstrate that it is a  presently responsible  contractor under federal procurement regulations and that it believes suspension or debarment is not appropriate.  On April 8, 2016, the Utility received a series of follow-up questions from the DOI regarding its November 2015 submission.  The Utility continues to fully cooperate with the DOI and is addressing its questions.   

As a result of the August 9, 2016 jury s verdict in the federal criminal trial, the Utility updated its registration on the federal government s System for Award Management (SAM), a federal procurement database, to reflect the verdict.  (The federal criminal trial is discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1 Legal Proceedings.)  The Utility does not believe that the updated registration will affect its existing contracts with the federal government, but it does affect execution of new contracts with the federal government.  Under federal law, the government may not enter into a contract with any corporation that was convicted of a felony criminal violation under any federal law within the preceding 24 months, where the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unless an agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination that this action is not necessary to protect the interests of the government.   

Following the update of the SAM, the Utility and the DOI have been in discussions regarding su  ch a determination and   a possible interim administrative agreement that would allow the federal government agencies to contract with the Utility while the DOI is completing its debarment inquiry. It is uncertain when and if the Utility and the DOI will enter into an interim administrative agreement. It is also uncertain when or if further action will be taken by the DOI.  The DOI debarment inquiry could result in the Utility s suspension or debarment from future federal government contracts for a fixed, specified time period or entering into an administrative agreement with the DOI to resolve debarment matters.  

As a result of the DOI inquiry and/or of the August 9, 2016 jury s guilty verdict on six felony counts in the federal criminal trial, the Utility may be required to implement remedial and other measures, such as a requirement that the Utility s natural gas operations and/or compliance and ethics programs be supervised by one or more independent third party monitor(s).  If appointed, the Utility expects a monitor or monitors would serve for a period of time and report periodically to the court or a department or agency of the government.  The Utility could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, to implement remedial and other measures that could be imposed, the amount of which the Utility is currently unable to estimate.  

Litigation Related to the San Bruno Accident and Natural Gas Spending 

As of September 30, 2016, there were seven purported derivative lawsuits seeking recovery on behalf of PG E Corporation and the Utility for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by officers and directors, among other claims.  

Four of the complaints were consolidated as the     San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases     and are pending in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo.     The remaining three cases are   Tellardin v. PG E Corp. et al.,   Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund v. Johns, et al.,   and   Bushkin v. Rambo et al  .  

On December 8, 2015, the California Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate to the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County, ordering the court to stay all proceedings in the four consolidated   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases   pending conclusion of the federal criminal proceedings against the Utility.  On September 16, 2016, the San Mateo Superior Court requested that all counsel appear for a status conference in the consoli  dated matter.    The date of the conference has   been set for November 16, 2016.   

53    

Bushkin v. Rambo et al  ., pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, has been designated by the plaintiff as related to the pending shareholder derivative suit   Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund v. Johns, et al.  , discussed below.  The plaintiff in the   Bushkin   lawsuit has agreed that this case should be stayed pending conclusion of the federal criminal trial against the Utility and, on May 3, 2016, the judge entered a stipulated order staying the case.  The order also provides that the parties should meet and confer within 30 days after the criminal trial concludes and provide the court a status update.  Despite the stay of his complaint, on June 20, 2016 the   Bushkin   plaintiff filed a petition in the Superior Court of California, San Francisco County, seeking to enforce the plaintiff s claimed right as a shareholder to inspect certain PG E Corporation accounting books and records pursuant to section 1601 of the California Corporations Code.  On July 25, 2016, PG E Corporation filed a motion to stay plaintiff s petition until the appellate stay of the San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases has been lifted, or, in the alternative, a demurrer asking the Court to dismiss plaintiff s petition.  On August 29, 2016, the San Francisco Superior Court granted PG E Corporation s motion, and indicated that plaintiff s petition was stayed pending resolution of the criminal matter against the Utility.  

The   Iron Workers   action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California has been stayed pending the resolution of the   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases  .  On May 5, 2016, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer within 30 days after the criminal trial concludes and provide the court a status update.  At the court s request, on August 22, 2016, the parties filed a statement requesting that the case continue to be stayed until resolution of the   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases  .  On August 31, 2016, the court set a case management conference for September 30, 2016, and requested the parties to file a joint case management conference st  atement by September 23, 2016.    On September 30, 2016, the court decided to continue the stay pending the   resolution of the   criminal proceedings against the Utility and ordered the parties to submit a joint status report on or before March 15, 2017.  

A case management conference in the action entitled   Tellardin v. PG E Corp. et al.,   also pending in the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County, had been scheduled for August 9, 2016.  On July 19, 2016, plaintiff requested that the court vacate the August 9, 2016 conference because, pursuant to the parties  agreement, defendants are not required to respond to the complaint in this action until 30 days after an order lifting the stay in the   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases  .  On August 2, 2016, the court vacated the August 9, 2016 conference.    

The federal crimin  al proceeding is still pending.    For more information   about the federal criminal proceeding  , see Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   and Item 1 Legal Proceedings.   

PG E Corporation and the Utility are uncertain when and how the above lawsuits will be resolved. 

R  EGULATORY MATTERS   

The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC and other federal and state regulatory agencies.        Significant regulatory developments that have occurred   since the 2015 Form 10-K was filed with the SEC  are discussed below.  

2017 General Rate Case  

On August 3, 2016, the Utility, together with ORA, TURN, and 12 other intervening parties filed a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that resolves nearly all of the issues raised by the parties in the Utility s 2017 GRC.    All parties who filed testimony in the case joined the settlement agreement, which was the subject of a one-day wor  kshop overseen by the assigned c  ommissioner and ALJ.  The settlemen  t agreement will ultimately be   c  onsidered by the full c  ommission.    In the GRC proceeding, the CPUC will determine the annual amount of base revenues (or  revenue requirements ) that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return.    (The Utility s revenue requirements for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission, natural gas transmission and storage services, and electricity and natural gas purchases, are authorized in other regulatory proceedings ove  rseen by the CPUC or the FERC.)  In its GRC application, the Utility requested an overall increase in electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and utility-owned electric generation revenue requirements of $319 million over currently authorized amounts (as updated through the Utility s   May 27, 2016 rebuttal testimony  ), effective January 1, 2017.  

54    

Revenue Requirements and Attrition Year Revenues  

The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility s 2016 authorized revenue requirement of $7.9 billion be increased by $88 million, effective January 1, 2017.  The settlement agreement further provides for an increase to the authorized 2017 revenues of $444 million in 2018 and an additional increase of $361 million in 2019, as shown in the table below. 

The settlement agreement identifies two contested issues.  First, the parties were unable to agree on whether there should be a third post-test year or  attrition  year for this GRC cycle.  ORA and the Utility recommend a third post-test year for this cycle that would provide for an additional increase of $361 million.  TURN and certain other settling parties oppose the third post-test year.  The other contested issue concerns whether the Utility should be authorized to establish a new balancing account for costs arising from the CPUC s rulemaking on natural gas leak abatement.  The Utility and certain settling parties support the balancing account.  TURN and certain other settling parties do not.  ORA does not oppose it.    Interested parties filed comments and reply comments on the contested issues and these issues were also discussed at the one-day workshop.  

The table below summarizes the differences between the amount of revenue requirement increases included in the Utility s request, as updated in the Utility s supplemental testimony filed on February 22, 2016 and its May 27, 2016 rebuttal testimony, and the amount proposed in the settlement agreement:  

(1  )      Rounded for presentation purposes.  

  (2  )   Whether or not revenues should be authorized for 2020 is a contested issue.  

The following table shows the difference between the Utility s requested increases in 2017 revenue requirements by line of business and the amounts proposed in the settlement agreement: 

(  1  )   R  ounded for presentation purposes.   

55    

The following table   shows the differences, by   line of business and cost category, between the amount of revenue requirements included in the GRC application and the amount proposed in the settlement agreement, as well as the differences between the 2016 authorized revenue requirements and (i) the GRC application and (ii) the amounts proposed in the settlement agreement:  

(  1  )   R  ounded for presentation purposes.  

The settlement agreement proposes reductions in the following areas forecast in the GRC application.  For gas distribution, reductions are proposed for corrosion control, leak management, gas operations technology, and new business.  For electric distribution, reductions are proposed for overhead maintenance, capacity, technology, mapping and records, reliability, substation management, new business, and undergrounding work.  For electric distribution, the capital-related reductions are offset in part by increases in the replacement and installation of additional units in specific asset areas.  For electric generation, the settlement agreement proposes to move costs related to Diablo Canyon seismic studies from the GRC to the Utility s Energy Resource Recovery Account proceeding.  Proposed reductions in the customer service area largely relate to the removal of certain costs from the forecast related to residential rate reform implementation.  Some of these costs would be recoverable through the existing Residential Rates Reform Memorandum Account, and the Utility could seek recovery of the remaining costs in a future filing with the CPUC.  Additionally, a number of company-wide reductions, including reductions to the Short-Term Incentive Plan and certain employee benefits, are proposed in the settlement agreement. 

Balancing Accounts 

The settlement agreement proposes to retain certain existing balancing accounts, including the Tax Act Memo Account that was first established following the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, and to eliminate certain memorandum and balancing accounts that are no longer necessary.  In addition to the contested balancing account for natural gas leak abatement mitigation costs, the settlement agreement proposes one new tax-related memorandum account to track the impact on the revenue requirement from certain types of changes in tax laws or regulations. 

Capital Additions and Rate Base 

The settlement agreement proposes capital expenditures of $3.9 billion for 2017 for the portions of the Utility s business addressed in the GRC.  Proposed capital expenditures are lower than the amount included in the GRC application of $4.0 billion for 2017, consistent with the provisions of the settlement agreement.  While the settlement agreement proposes overall revenue requirement increases for 2018 and 2019, it does not specify capital expenditures for those years. 

56    

The settlement agreement proposes a 2017 weighted average rate base of $24.3 billion for the portions of the Utility s business reviewed in the GRC, compared with the Utility s request of $24.5 billion.  The $200 million difference is primarily due to the lower level of capital expenditures agreed to in the settlement.   

On August 30, 2016, the   CPUC   held a workshop to allow the assigned CPUC commissioner, the assigned   ALJ  , and other interested parties to pose questions to the Utility and other   settling parties regarding the settlement a  greement.  The Utility and the parties also discussed post-test years 2018 and 2019  , including imputed capital additions   and rate base amounts, and   the   two contested issues: a third post-test year or  attrition  year for this GRC cycle   (i.e. for 2020)   and whether the Utility should be authorized to establish a new balancing account for costs arising from the CPUC s rulemaking on natural gas leak abatement.    The Utility estimated authorized   capital expenditures of $3.6 billion for 2018 and $3.5 billion for 2019, based on a calculation method that is subject to   CPUC   approval, as compared to its request of   approximately   $4.0 billion each year. The Utility is unable to predict if the   CPUC   will approve its proposed calculation m  ethod. The Utility also estimated  a   weighted average rate base of $25.4 billion for 2018 and $26.3 billion for 2019, compared with the Utility s request of $25.7 billion and $26.9 billion, respectively.  

Evidentiary hearings were h  e  l  d on September 1, 2016.    Under the current schedule, a proposed decision is expected to be released in January 2017, and a final CPUC decision is expected to be issued in February 2017.  On March 17, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision to allow the authorized revenue requirement changes to become effective on January 1, 2017, even if the final decision is issued after that date.  

PG E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether the CPUC will approve the settlement agreement. 

For more information, see Item 4 of the 2015 Form 10-K and Item 2 of the 2016 Q1 Form 10-Q and the 2016 Q2 Form 10-Q. 

2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case  

On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final decision in phase one of the Utility s 2015 GT S rate case.      The decision adopts the  interim  revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect through rates beginning August 1, 2016, to recover its costs of gas transmission and storage services for the 2015 GT S rate case period (see table below).      The decision authorizes the Utility to collect, over a 36-month period, the difference between adopted revenue requirements and amounts previously collected in rates, retroactive to January 1, 2015.  The Utility will not be able to record the full revenue requirement increase since January 1, 2015 until after the final phase two decision is issued.      In addition, accounting rules allow the Utility to recognize revenues in a given year only if they will be collected from customers within 24 months of the end of that year.      As a result, the Utility will not be able to complete recording the full retroactive revenue requirement increase in 2016.  

The phase one decision adopts capital expenditures of roughly $700 million to $800 million per year through 2018 and authorizes weighted average rate base of $2.9 billion in 2015, $3.3 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2017, and $4.2 billion in 2018, before the application of the shareholder-funded safety work disallowance associated with the Penalty Decision.  The authorized weighted average rate base excludes $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted.  The decision permanently disallows $120 million of that amount and orders that the remaining $576 million be subject to a third party audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding.  The decision also establishes various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current rate case cycle including new one-way capital balancing accounts.  As a result, in the second quarter of 2016, the Utility incurred charges of $190 million for capital expenditures that the Utility believes are probable of disallowance based on the decision. This includes $134 million to the net plant balance for 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts and $56 million for the Utility s estimate of 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts.  Additional charges may be required in the future based on the Utility s ability to manage its capital spending and on the outcome of the third party audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending.   

The phase one decision denies the Utility s request for full balancing account treatment for recovery of authorized transportation and storage revenue requirements, and instead continues the revenue sharing mechanism authorized in the 2011 GT S rate case that subjects a portion of the Utility s transportation and storage revenue requirement to market risk.  

The phase one decision also authorizes the Utility s request for cost recovery of up to $157 million for the construction of Line 407, a 25.5 mile, 30-inch pipeline in the Sacramento Valley expected to be built during this rate case period.  The authorized revenue requirements will begin when Line 407 becomes operational, subject to refund upon a reasonableness review in the Utility s next GT S rate case.  The decision authorizes the Utility to track costs exceeding $157 million and seek recovery in the next GT S rate case, subject to a reasonableness review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

57    

On November 1, 2016,   the assigned ALJ issued a phase two proposed decision ( phase two PD )   regarding the $850 million penalty assessed in the Penalty Decision.  In accordance with   the   phase one decision, the phase two PD   would first reduce   the recommended revenue requirement by the $850 million San Bruno penalty to determine the revenue requirement to be collected   from customers, and then apply   the ex parte disallowance.  The phase two PD   would apply   $689 million of the $850 million penalty (81 percent) to capital expenditures and the remaining $161 million (19 percent) to expenses  , and   then reduce the 2015 revenue requirement by $72 million for the 5-month delay caused by the Utility s violation of the CPUC ex parte communication rules in this proceeding.   

Accordingly, the phase two PD   would adopt   a 2015 revenue requirement of $815 million, a 2016 revenue requirement of $1.061 billion, a 2017 revenue requirement of $1.125   billion, and a 2018 revenue requirement of $1.230   billion.      These amounts reflect attrition increases     of $246 million in 2016, $64 million in 2017, and $105 million in 2018.  Excluding the $161 million for the expense portion of the Penalty Decision disallowance and the $72 million ex parte disallowance, the attrition increase would be $1  3   million in 2016.    

The following table shows the revenue requirement amounts requested by the Utility in the 2015 GT S rate case, the  interim  revenue requirement amounts adopted in the phase one decision, and the revenue requirement amounts recommended in the phase two PD, including adjustments for the $850 million Penalty Decision disallowance and the ex parte disallowance: 

The phase two PD   also recommends   weighted average rate base reductions of $99 million in 2015, $453 million in 2016, $670 million in 2017, and $658 million in 2018  , resulting in total   weighted average rate base of $2.8 billion in 2015, $2.8 billion in 2016, $3.0 billion in 2  017, and $3.5 billion in 2018.    The proposed decision would reduce rate base by the full amount of the dis  allowed capital expenditures but   would not remove the associated deferred taxes, resulting in a   larger rate base reduction.    It is unclear whether this treatment would apply beyond this rate case period.  

In additio  n, the phase two PD would approve   the Utility s list of programs which meet the CPUC s definition of  safety related,  the costs of which are to be funded through the $850 million penalty.   

Opening briefs on the phase two PD are due on November 21, 2016 and reply briefs are due on November 28, 2016.  The final phase two decision is expected to be issued withi  n 30 days of the reply briefs.    With the addition of a third attrition year, the Utility s next GT S cycle will begin in 2019.  The decision requires the Utility to file its next GT S application in 2017.

FE  RC Transmission Owner Rate Cases  

On July 29, 2015, the Utility requested a 2016 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.515 billion, a $314 million increase over the currently authorized revenue requirement of $1.201 billion.  The Utility s proposed rates went into effect on March 1, 2016, subject to refund, and pending a final decision by the FERC.  On September 1, 2016, the Utility and other settling parties (including the CPUC) filed a motion at the FERC for approval of a settlement proposing that the Utility s 2016 retail electric transmission revenue requirement be set at $1.331 billion, a $130 million increase over the currently authorized revenue requirement.  The settlement is subject to the FERC s approval.  The Utility also filed a motion on September 1, 2016, requesting the implementation of interim rates that, as of result of the settlement, became effective for wholesale customers on September 1, 2016 and for retail customers on October 1, 2016, subject to refund and pending a final decision by the FERC.  The FERC is expected to issue a decision in late 2016 or early 2017.     

58    

On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed a rate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.718 billion, a $203 million increase over the 2016 requested revenue requirement of $1.515 billion (and a $387 million increase over the pending settlement revenue requirement of $1.331 billion).  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 is $6.7 billion, compared to a forecasted rate base of $5.85 billion in 2016.  The Utility is also seeking a return on equity of 10.9% which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the filing, the Utility forecasted that it will make investments of $1.296 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.    

On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility s July 2016 filing and set it for settlement negotiations.  The order set an effective date for rates of March 1, 2017, and made the rates subject to hearing and refund.  The first settlement conference took place on October 19, 2016.  The next settlement conference is scheduled for February 7 and February 8, 2017.  

CPUC Cost of Capital Decision 

On February 25, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision granting a petition for modification filed by the Utility and the other two California investor-owned electric utilities to clarify that the CPUC s previously adopted cost of capital adjustment mechanism would not be triggered before their 2018 cost of capital applications are due on April 20, 2017.      As a result, the Utility s currently authorized return on equity of 10.40% and capital structure, consisting of 52% common equity, 47% long-term debt, and 1% preferred stock, will remain the same for 2017.  

Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant  

Joint Proposal for Plant Retirement 

On   August 11, 2016,   the Utility   submitted an application to the CPUC   to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 and replace it with a portfolio of energy efficiency   and GHG-free resources.    The application   implements   a joint proposal   between the Utility and   the Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, Coalition of California Utility Employees, and Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility  .   

The   application and   joint proposal   include   a voluntary increase in the Utility s target for   RPS  -  eligible resources to 55%  , effective in 2031 through 2045, as compared to   the state s goal of 50%   renewables.       The parties to the joint   proposal   proposed that the Utility be authorized to procure GHG-free replacement resources in three competitive procurement tranches  : in Tranche 1, the Utility would   be authorized to obtain 2,000 gross   GWh   of energy efficiency savings to be implemented over the 2018 to 2024 time period; in Tranche 2, the Utility would be   authorized to procure through a solicitation 2,000 GWh   of GHG-free energy resources that will commence energy deliveries or add energy efficiency projects to the system   in the 2025 to 2030 time period; and   in Tranche 3, the Utility   would   c  ommit to a voluntary 55% RPS, and would   maintain this voluntary commitment through 2045 or until superseded by action of the state legislature or the CPUC.       The three tranches of resource procurement in the   application and   joint proposal are not intended to specify all energy resources that will be needed to ensure the orderly replacement of Diablo Canyon.  Instead, the Utility expects that the full solution   will be addressed in ongoing CPUC proceedings  .    

Costs associated with energy efficiency   projects or   programs in Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 would be recovered through the Utility s electric   public purpose program   rates as non-bypassable charges, consistent with the existing recovery mechanisms for energy efficiency program costs.  GHG-free energy resources costs from Tranche 2   are proposed to be recovered through   a non-bypassable cost allocation mechanism called the Clean California Charge that (1) equitably allocates costs and benefits, such as RPS or Resource Adequacy credits, associated with the procurement among responsible load-serving entities, and (2) determines the net capacity costs of such procurement consistent with the methodology for the allocation of net capacity costs laid out by the CPUC.  Costs associate  d with procurement for Tranche   3 would be recovered through a separate   r  enewable non-bypassable charge.     

59    

The   application seeks   confirmation from the CPUC that the Utility s full investment in Diablo Canyon and authorized rate of return will be recovered in rates by the time the facility ceases operations.    Additionally, the Utility requests that the CPUC pre-approve the recovery of certain costs related to the closure of the Diablo Canyon. These include the non-bypassable cost allocation mechanism for procurement of GHG-free energy and the recovery of $1.3 billion for administration and acquisition of the new Tranche 1 energy efficiency procurement as authorized energy efficiency funding, subject to return of all unspent funds; the recovery of employee retention and retraining and development programs to continue safe and efficient operation of Diablo Canyon through the end of its license periods, estimated at approximately $350 million  ;   and a community mitigation program to compensate San Luis Obispo County for the decline in local economic stimulus provided by Diablo Canyon through a transition period ending in 2025, estimated at approximately $50 million. The Utility also seeks cost recovery of approximately $50 million in costs related to the federal and state Diablo Canyon license renewal process.  

More than 40 parties have   submitted responses and protests to the Utility s application  .    A prehearing conference on the   application   was held on October 6, 2016. The   ALJ   heard arguments on the scope of issues to be addressed in the proceeding and stated he would issue a scoping order after the   public participation hearings that were   held in San Luis Obispo on October 20  , 2016.    On October 27, 2016, the ALJ issued a ruling requiring the Utility to submit supplemental testimony related to Diablo Canyon land ownership no lat  er than November 18, 2016.  The Utility   expects that a fina  l decision will be issued by the end of 2017.    Upon CPUC approval of the application, the Utility will withdraw its license renewal application currently pending before the NRC when such approval has become final and non-appealable.  PG E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether the CPUC will approve the application.  

California State Lands Commission Lands Lease 

On June 28, 2016, California State Lands Commission approved a new lands lease for the intake and discharge structures at Diablo Canyon to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon s current operating licenses, until Diablo Canyon Unit 2 ceases operations in August 2025.  The Utility bel  ieves that the approval of the new l  ease will ensure sufficient time for the Utility to identify and bring online a portfolio of GHG-free replacement resources.  The Utility will submit a future lease extension request to address the period of time required for plant decommissioning, which under NRC regulations   can take as long as 20 years.    On August 28,   2016,   the World Business Academy (WBA) filed a writ in the Los Angeles Superior Court.  WBA asserts that the State Lands Commission committed legal error when   it   determined that the short term lease extension for an existing facility was exempt from review under the California Environm  ental Quality Act.    If the petitio  ner prevails in its challenge, t  he State Lands Commission could be required to perform an environme  ntal review of the new lands lease.   No schedule   has been set for consideration of   the writ at this time but the Utility   expects a ruling in the first half of 2017.  

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Utility expects that the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon will take many years after the expiration of its current operating licenses.    Detailed studies of the cost to decommission the Utility s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the N  DCTP  .  Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.  

On March 1, 2016, the Utility submitted its updated decommissioning cost estimate with the CPUC.  The estimated undiscounted cost to decommission the Utility s nuclear power plants increased by approximately $  1.4   billion, for a total estimated cost of $  4.8   billion, due to increased estimated costs related to spent fuel storage, staffing, and out-of-state waste disposal.  The Utility requested that the CPUC authorize the collection of increased annual revenue requirements beginning on January 1, 2017 based on     these updated cost estimates.  Additionally, a  s a result of the joint proposal discussed abo  ve, an increase   of $115 million to the ARO was recognized on the   Utility s   Conde  nsed Consolidated Balance Sheets  in the second quarter of 2016.   

While the NDCTP forecast includes employee severance program estimates, it does not include estimated costs related to the joint proposal s employee retention and retraining and development programs, and the San Luis Obispo County community mitigation program described above.  The Utility intends to conduct a site-specific decommissioning study to update the 2015 NDCTP forecast and to submit the study to the CPUC by mid-2019.   

60    

On Ju  ly 15, 2016, the assigned CPUC c  ommissioner and ALJ issued a scoping memo for the Utility s 2015 NDCTP and excluded from the scope of the proceeding the issue on whether the Utility should be required to present additional analysis for a license extension scenario for Diablo Canyon, as a result of the Utility s announcement of its plan to not seek relicensing of Diablo Canyon beyond its current operating authority. The scoping memo also adopts within the scope of the proceeding a reasonableness review of the Utility s estimated updated cost to decommission the Utility s nuclear power plants and of the forecasts of certain expenses and the decommissioning   trust funds  rates of return.  E  videntiary hearings   took place in September 2016 and opening   briefs   were submitted on October 14, 2016.    Intervenor parties proposed several major recommendations including a reduction to the   total   spent nuclear fuel storage forecast, a reduction to the large component   (reactor vessels, steam generators, and other large plant components)   removal cost estimate, and a reduction to the waste disposal estimate. Additionally, intervenors asserted that the CPUC should not permit the Utility to increase its Diablo Canyon-related revenue requirement at this time as it has not demonstrated its current estimate is reasonable. Parties also claimed that the Utility has not justified its increase to security costs and decommissioning oversight contractor staff costs. No party challenged the Utility s decommissioning trust funds rates of return or cost escalation assumptions.      Reply briefs were submitte  d on October 31, 2016.    Intervenor parties reiterated that the Utility has not justified increases in costs due to large component removal, site security, decommissioning contractor staff, spent nuclear fuel storage, and waste disposal.  The Utility confirmed that the testimony and work papers support the cost increases as well as the total estimate to decommission Diablo Canyon.  

The estimated nuclear decommissioning cost is discounted for GAAP purposes and recognized as an ARO on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The total nuclear decommissioning obligation accrued   in accordance with GAAP was $3.5   billion at   September 30, 2016  , which includes an $818 million adjustment to reflect the increased cost estimates   and the $115 million increase resulting from the joint proposal   described above, and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2015.  The  se estimates are based on   decommissioning cost studies, prepared in accordance with the CPUC requirements.  Changes in these estimates could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the nuclear decommissioning trust accounts  total fair value was $2.9 billion.  Changes in the estimated costs, the timing of decommissioning or the assumptions underlying these estimates could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission.    

For additional information, see the 2015 Form 10-K  ,   the 2016 Q1   Form 10-Q, and the 2016 Q2   Form 10-Q.  

CPUC Investigation of the Utility s Safety Culture  

On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG E Corporation and the Utility prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards.   The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate the Utility s and PG E Corporation s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility s record of operations, including its record of safety incidents.   The CPUC authorized the SED to engage a consultant to assist in the SED s investigation and the preparation of a report co  ntaining the SED s assessment.    The consultant     s   work   beg  a  n in the second quarter of 2016  .  

The CPUC stated that the initial phase of the proceeding was categorized as rate setting because it will consider issues both of fact and policy and because the Utility and PG E Corporation do not face the prospect of fines, penalties, or remedies in this phase. Upon completion of the con  sultant s report, the assigned c  ommissioner will determine the scope of and next actions in the proceeding. The timing  ,   scope and potential outcome of the investigation are uncertain.  

Rehearing of CPUC Decisions Approving   2006   2008   Energy Efficiency Incentive Awards  

On September 17, 2015, the CPUC granted TURN s and ORA s long-standing applications for rehearing of the CPUC decisions that awarded energy efficiency incentive payments to the California IOUs for the 2006-2008 energy efficiency program cycle.  Under the incentive ratemaking mechanism applicable to the 2006-2008 program cycle, the Utility could have earned incentive revenues up to a maximum of $180 million, depending on the extent to which the Utility achieved the energy savings targets.  Conversely, to the extent the Utility failed to achieve the targets, the Utility could have been required to offset future incentive earnings claims by amounts previously awarded, and, in addition, could have incurred penalties of up to $180 million.  The Utility was awarded a total of $104 million for the 2006-2008 program cycle.  

61    

On   September 15, 2016, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement filed by the Utility, ORA, and TURN   to resolve all issues related to the 2006-2008 customer energy efficien  cy shareholder incentives. The final decision   requir  es the Utility to reduce   future energy efficiency shareholder incentives by $29.1 million.  The reduction of the shareholder incentive award will be applied in installments of $5.8 million per year for five years, provided that the Utility has sufficient energy efficiency incentive awards to offset that amount.  If shareholder incentives are insufficient to offset this amount, the offset in the following year will be increased by the shortfall.  At its discretion, the Utility may increase the amount o  f the offset to reduce the $29.1 million   more quickly.  If the amount has not been fully offset at the end of five years, the balance will be credited   against future energy efficiency program spending. The first offset was   requested by the Utility in the September 1, 2016 shareh  older incentive advice letter   related to the 2014-2015 Energy Efficiency Incentive Awards (see below).  

2014     2015 Energy Efficiency Incentive Awards  

On September 1, 2016, the Utility filed an advice letter with the CPUC requesting a shareholder incentive award for a portion of the energy savings it achieved through its energy efficiency programs in   the   2014 and 2015 program years.  The Utility requested $24.9 million, and further requested that this amount be reduced by $5.8 million as a result of the settlement agreement related to the 2006-2008 energy efficiency awards, for a total award of $19.1 million.  As indicated above, on September 15, 2016, the CPUC approved the settlement agreement.  On October 7, 2016, the Utility submitted a supplemental shareholder incentive advice letter reflecting the approval by the CPUC of the settlement agreement and other minor modifications to its September 1, 2016 incentive award request  .    The advice letter requires CPUC approval in a resolution, which the Utility anticipates receiving during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Utility-Owned   PV   Generation   Cost Savings   Incentive Award  

In April 2010, the CPUC authorized the Utility to develop, own, and operate PV facilities and established a cost savings incentive mechanism which states that shareholders are eligible to retain ten percent of the difference between the actual average cost per unit and the threshold set by the CPUC.  From 2011   2013, the Utility constructed nine PV   projects   with a total capacity of 150 MW and the weighted average unit capital cost came in below the CPUC specified threshold.  In J  uly 2016, the CPUC approved the recovery of   $16 million in   shareholder incentives   related to these projects   under the   PV   capital cost savings incentive mechanism.  

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES  

T  he California Legislature and the CPUC have adopted requirements, policies and decisions to improve and refine gas and electric safety citation programs, accommodate the growth in distributed electric generation resources (including solar installations), increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to customers, foster the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage the use of electric vehicles, promote customer energy efficiency and demand response programs, and implement new state law requirements applicable to natural gas storage facilities.      In addition, the CPUC continues to implement state law requirements to reform electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities  actual costs of service, reduce cross-subsidization among customer rate classes, implement new rules and rates for net energy metering (which currently allow   certain   self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate), and allow customers to have greater control over their energy use.     Significant developments that have occurred since the 2015 Form 10-K was filed with the SEC   are discussed below.   

The Utility s ability to recover its costs, including investments associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as its electricity procurement and other operating costs, will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility s electricity and natural gas service.         

Electric Distribution Resources Plan 

As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, the Utility filed its proposed electric distribution resources plan for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility s plan identifies optimal locations on its electric distribution system for deployment of   DERs  .  The Utility s proposal is designed to allow energy technologies to be interconnected with each other and integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  The Utility envisions a future electric grid, titled the Grid of Things , that would allow customers to choose new advanced energy supply technologies and services to meet their needs consistent with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.    

62    

In August 2016, as part of the CPUC s consideration of the Utility s electric distribution   resources   plan, hearings were held on field demonstration projects proposed by the Utility to test various distribution-related services that   DERs   might provide to the Utility.  A CPUC decision is expected later this year on the field demonstration projects.    

Additionally, on August 22, 20  16, the Utility filed comments   generally supporting a CPUC ruling proposing a revised scope and schedule for the proceeding.  At this time, it is uncertain when a final CPUC decision approving, disapproving or modifying the Utility s electric distribution resources plan will be issued.  

Integrated Distributed Energy Resources    Regulatory Incentives Pilot Program  

On Ap  ril 4, 2016, the assigned CPUC c  ommissioner and ALJ issued a ruling proposing to establish, on a pilot basis, an interim program offering regulatory incentives to the Utility and the other two large California IOUs for the deployment of cost-effective DERs.  The ruling assumes that the incentive would take the form o  f an additional payment to the U  tility of 3.5% (grossed up for taxes) of the payments made to the DER provider(s).  The exact figure would be determined later if the proposal or a similar alternative is adopted by the CPUC.  The ruling also states that it does not intend for this phase to adopt a new regulatory framework or business model for the California electric utilities.  

On May 9 and May 23, 2016, the Utility, two other California utilities (the  Joint Utilities ) and other parties filed their comments.  The Joint Utilities indicate that providing a regulatory incentive to utilities to deploy DERs in place of distribution investment is premature until the operating and performance characteristics of DERs are better understood and evaluated as part of pilot projects.  The Joint Utilities instead propose initiating DER pilots that would advance understanding of distribution deferral and DER procurement processes.  

On September 1, 2016, the assigned CPUC commissioner and ALJ issued an amended scoping memo and ruling   that re-categorized   all activities in the proceedin  g as rate-setting, consolidated   remaining issu  es into one phase, and proposed   a revised regulatory incentive pilot to test how an earnings opportunity affects DER sourcing.  On September 15 and September 22, 2016, the Joint Utilities and other parties filed comments on the revised regulatory incentive pilot.  The Joint Utilities support piloting different earnings mechanisms to better compare advantages and disadvantages of different alternatives and repeated their recommendation that the CPUC enable a broader dialogue on utility compensation mechanisms, rather than narrowly focusing on regulatory incentives for DER deployment.  A proposed CPUC decision is expected later this year.  

Electric Rate Reform and Net Energy Metering 

On July 3, 2015, the CPUC approved a final decision to authorize the California   IOUs   to gradually flatten their tiered residential electric rate structures from four tiers to two tiers by January 1, 2019.      The decision   approved higher minimum bill charges for residential customers and   also allows the imposition of a surcharge on customers with extremely high electricity use beginning in 2017.      The decision requires the Utility to file a proposal by January 1, 2018, to charge residential   electric   customers based on time-of-use rates   (known as  default time-of-use rates )   unless customers elect otherwise.      The Utility also may propo  se to impose a fixed charge on residential electric c  ustomers.      Under the CPUC s decision, default time-of-use rates must be implemented before the CPUC will permit the imposition of a fixed charge   in electric rates  .     

In January 2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules and rates.  The new rules and rates are expected to become effective for new NEM customers later in 2016, when the Utility is expected to reach its current NEM cap.  The CPUC indicated that it may revisit the NEM successor tariff in 2019.  After the current NEM cap is reached, new NEM customers will be required to pay an interconnection fee, will be charged for energy use on time-of-use rates, and will be required to pay non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low-income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.  Unlike the initial NEM tariff, there is no cap on the total capacity of distributed generation that can be installed under the new rules. On March 7, 2016, the Utility and certain other parties, including TURN and CUE, filed applications for rehearing.  The Utility requested that the CPUC vacate its January 2016 decision that the Utility asserts contains legal and factual errors.  Many parties argued that the CPUC failed to complete its duties under AB 327, which required the CPUC to evaluate the costs and benefits of NEM. On Septemb  er 15, 2016, the CPUC voted   to deny the applications for rehearing, concluding that good cause had not been established to grant a rehearing and that the NEM decision adopted a successor tariff as required.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Development  

In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adopting a policy to expand the California utilities  role in developing EV charging infrastructure to support California s climate goals.      On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application requesting that the CPUC approve the Utility s proposal to deploy, own, and maintain more than 25,000 EV charging stations and the associated infrastructure.  The Utility proposed to engage with third-party EV service providers to operate and maintain the charging stations.  The Utility requested that the CPUC approve forecasted capital expenditures of $551 million over the five-year deployment period.  

On Septem  ber 4, 2015, the assigned CPUC c  ommissioner and the ALJ issued a scoping memo and procedural schedule that required the Utility to supplement its application by submitting a more phased deployment approach that will be considered in a   first phase of the proceeding.    On October 12, 2015, the Utility submitted supplemental testimony pres  enting two separate proposals, with the first proposal including capital expenditures of $70 million for approximately 2,500 charging stations and the second proposal comprising $187 million for approximately 7,500 charging stations.   

After discussions with a number of parties about the two proposals, the Utility filed with the CPUC a settlement agreement on March 21, 2016 that it entered into with environmental advocates, automakers, electric vehicle drivers, labor, and environmental justice advocates, to deploy about 7,500 charging stations over three years with forecasted capital expenditures of $132 million.      (TURN,   ORA  , and certain equipment suppliers are not parties to the   settlement   agreement  and filed responses on April 12, 2016, ge  nerally opposing the settlement agreement.)    The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the CPUC.     H  earings   were   held in April 2016   and   a proposed decision for the first phase of the proceeding is expected to be issued in the   fourth   quarter of 2016.   Further deployment of EV charging stations would be considered in a second phase of the proceeding depending on the outcome of the first phase.     

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  

The Utility s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utility s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility s activities, including the remediation of hazardous wastes  , such as   groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility s natural gas compressor stations  ; the reporting and reduction of carbon dioxide and other   greenhouse gas   emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fue  l.      (See   Note 9 of the N  otes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , as well as    Item 1A. Risk Factors  and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.)  

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS  

PG E Corporation and the Utility enter into contractual commitments in connection with future obligations that relate to purchases of electricity and natural gas for customers, purchases of transportation capacity, purchases of renewable energy, and purchases of fuel and transportation to support the Utility s generation activities.  (See    Purchase   Commitments  in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  Contractual commitments that relate to financing arrangements include long-term debt, preferred stock, and certain forms of regulatory financing.  For more in-depth discussion about PG E Corporation s and the Utility s contractual commitments, see  Liquidity and Financial Resources  above and Management s Discussion and Analysis   of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Contractual Commitments in the 201  5   Form 10-K.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

PG E Corporation and the Utility do not have any  off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources  , other than those discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K (the Utility s commodity purchase agreements)  .  

64    

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES  

PG E Corporation  , mainly through its ownership of the   Utility,   and the Utility   are exposed to market risk, which is the risk that changes in market conditions will adversely affect net income or cash flows.  PG E Corporation and the Utility face market risk associated with their operations; their financing arrangements; the marketplace for elect  ricity, natural gas, electric   transmission, natural gas transportation,   and   storage;   emissions allowances and offset credits,   other goods and services; and other aspects of their businesses.  PG E Corporation and the Utility categorize market risks as  pric  e risk  and  interest rate risk.     The Utility is also exposed to  credit risk,  the risk that counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations.      

The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity cost vola  tility, and manage cash flows.    T  he Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (  i.e  ., risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes.  The Utility s risk management activities include the use of   physical   and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements, most of which are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases.      The Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings, and other credit criteria as deemed appropriate.   Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.      These   activities are  discussed in detail in the   2015   Form 10-K.  There were no significant developments to the   Utility   s   and PG E Corporation   s risk management activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30  ,   2016  .  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Sta  tements in accordance with   GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  PG E Corporation and the Utility consider their accounting policies for regulatory assets and liabilities, loss contingencies associated with environmental remediation liabilities and legal and regulatory matters, asset retirement obligations, and pension and other postretirement benefits plans to be critical accounting policies.   These policies are considered critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and material to the financial position and results of operations of PG E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of ma  terial judgments and estimates.    Actual results may differ materially   from these estimates.   These accounting policies and their key characteristics are discussed in detail in the   2015  Form 10-K  .   

ACCOUNTING   STANDARDS   ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED

68    

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIV  E DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

PG E Corporation s and the Utility s primary market risk results from changes in energy commodity prices.  PG E Corporation and the Utility engage in price risk management activities for non-trading purposes only.  Both PG E Corporation and the Utility may engage in these price risk management activities using forward contracts, futures, options, and swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations on energy commodity prices and interest rates.  (See the section above entitled  Risk Management Activities  in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.) 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Based on an evaluation of PG E Corporation s and the Utility s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30,   2016  ,   PG E Corporation s and the Utility s respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by PG E Corporation and the Utility in reports that the companies file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.  In addition, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by PG E Corporation and the Utility in the reports that PG E Corporation and the Utility file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to PG E Corporation s and the Utility s management, including PG E Corporation s and the Utility s respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   quarter   ended   September 30,   2016  ,   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PG E Corporation s or the Utility s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

In addition to the following legal proceedings, PG E Corporation and the Utility are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.    For more information regarding PG E Corporation s and the Utility s contingencies, see Note     9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement and Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  Enforcement and Litigation Matters.   

Penalty Decision Related to the CPUC s Investigative Enforcement Proceedings Related to Natural Gas Transmission  

For a description of this matter, see    Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings      in the 2015 Form 10-K  , the discussion of the Penalty Decision in   Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   in  the 2015 Form 10-K, and the discussion included in Note 9 of   the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Federal Criminal Trial  

On June 14, 2016, a federal criminal trial against the Utility began in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, on 12 felony counts alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integrity management, and identification of pipeline threats, and one felony count charging that the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident.  On July 26, 2016, the court granted the government s motion to dismiss Count 13 alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully failed to retain a strength test pressure record with respect to a distribution feeder main, thereby reducing the total number of counts from 13 to 12.  

On August 2, 2016, the remaining Alternative Fines Act sentencing allegations in the case were dismissed.  The Alternative Fines Act states, in part:  If any person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss.   (The remaining allegations related to $281 million of gross gains that the government alleged the Utility derived.  As previously disclosed, in December 2015, the court dismissed the government s allegations regarding the amount of losses.) 

On August 9, 2016, the jury returned its verdict.  The jury acquitted the Utility on all six of the record-keeping allegations but found the Utility guilty on six felony counts that include one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of   pipeline   integrity management regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act.    

On August 16, 2016, the Utility filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for the six counts on which the jury returned a guilty verdict.  The court indicated that it will decide on this motion based on briefs filed by the parties, without oral argument. The Utility is not able to predict when the court will decide on the motion. A sentencing hearing is currently scheduled for January 23, 2017. 

For description of this matter, see  Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings  in the 2015 Form 10-K, the section entitled  Enforcement and Litigation Matters  in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in the 2015 Form 10-K, and  the section  entitled  Enforcement and Litigation Matters  in Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Litigation Related to the   San Bruno Accident and Natural Gas Spending  

As of September 30, 2016, there were seven purported derivative lawsuits seeking recovery on behalf of PG E Corporation and the Utility for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by officers and directors, among other claims.  

Four of the complaints were consolidated as the     San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases     and are pending in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo.     The remaining three cases are   Tellardin v. PG E Corp. et al.,  Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund v. Johns, et al.,   and   Bushkin v. Rambo et al  .  

On December 8, 2015, the California Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate to the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County, ordering the court to stay all proceedings in the four consolidated   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases   pending conclusion of the federal criminal proceedings against the Utility.  On September 16, 2016, the San Mateo Superior Court requested that all counsel appear for a status conferenc  e in the consolidated matter.    The date of the conference has   been set for November 16, 2016.  

70    

Bushkin v. Rambo et al  ., pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, has been designated by the plaintiff as related to the pending shareholder derivative suit   Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund v. Johns, et al.  , discussed below.  The plaintiff in the   Bushkin   lawsuit has agreed that this case should be stayed pending conclusion of the federal criminal trial against the Utility and, on May 3, 2016, the judge entered a stipulated order staying the case.  The order also provides that the parties should meet and confer within 30 days after the criminal trial concludes and provide the court a status update.  Despite the stay of his complaint, on June 20, 2016 the   Bushkin   plaintiff filed a petition in the Superior Court of California, San Francisco County, seeking to enforce the plaintiff s claimed right as a shareholder to inspect certain PG E Corporation accounting books and records pursuant to section 1601 of the California Corporations Code.  On July 25, 2016, PG E Corporation filed a motion to stay plaintiff s petition until the appellate stay of the San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases has been lifted, or, in the alternative, a demurrer asking the Court to dismiss plaintiff s petition.  On August 29, 2016, the San Francisco Superior Court granted PG E Corporation s motion, and indicated that plaintiff s petition was stayed pending resolution of the criminal matter against the Utility.  

The   Iron Workers   action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California has been stayed pending the resolution of the   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases  .  On May 5, 2016, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer within 30 days after the criminal trial concludes and provide the court a status update.  At the court s request, on August 22, 2016, the parties filed a statement requesting that the case continue to be stayed until resolution of the   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases  .  On August 31, 2016, the court set a case management conference for September 30, 2016, and requested the parties to file a joint case management conference statement by Septem  ber 23, 2016.    On September 30, 2016, the court decided to continue the stay pending the   resolution of the   criminal proceedings against the Utility and ordered the parties to submit a joint status report on or before March 15, 2017.  

A case management conference in the action entitled   Tellardin v. PG E Corp. et al.,   also pending in the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County, had been scheduled for August 9, 2016.  On July 19, 2016, plaintiff requested that the court vacate the August 9, 2016 conference because, pursuant to the parties  agreement, defendants are not required to respond to the complaint in this action until 30 days after an order lifting the stay in the   San Bruno Fire Derivative Cases  .  On August 2, 2016, the court vacated the August 9, 2016 conference.    

PG E Corporation and the Utility are uncertain when and how the above lawsuits will be resolved. 

For additional information regarding these matters, see the discussion entitled  Enforcement and Litigation Matters  above in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  In addition, see  Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings  in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Butte Fire   Litigation  

In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the  Butte fire ) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.    On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire     released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the   wildfire.      According to Cal Fire s report, the   fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two fatalities, and destroyed   549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commercial properties.    Cal Fire s     report concluded that the wildfire was     caused when a Gray Pine tree contacted     the Utility s     electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility     and its vegetation management contractors     to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree.      In a press release also issued on April 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million from the Utility.  

On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California for Sacramento County.      Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.      The California Judicial Council had previously authorized the coordination of all cases in Sacramento County.      As of September 30, 2016, approximately   50   complaints have been filed against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador involving approximately   1,85  0   individual plaintiffs   representing approximately 800 households   and their insurance compa  nies.      These complaints are   part of   or are in the process of being added to   the two master complaints.     Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability.    The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may increase in the future.      

71    

The Utility continues mediating and settling preference cases (presented by individuals who due to their age and/or physical condition are not likely to meaningfully participate in a trial under normal scheduling).      The Utility also has begun scheduling mediation of other cases.      Case   management   conferences were   held on July 14, 2016     and September 1, 2016.  The   next case management conference is scheduled for December 1, 2016  .     

72    

In connection with this matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys  fees without having been found negligent, through the theory of inverse condemnation.      In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent  .    The Utility believes it was not negligent  ; however, there can be no assurance that a court or a jury would agree with the Utility.

Other Enforcement Matters 

Fines may be imposed, or other regulatory or governmental enforcement action could be taken, with respect to the Utility s self-reports of noncompliance with natural gas safety regulations, prohibited ex parte communications between the Utility and CPUC personnel, investigations that were commenced after a pipeline explosion in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014, and other enforcement matters.  See the discussion entitled  Enforcement and Litigation Matters  above in Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 9 of   the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.      In addition, see    Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings  in the 2015 Form 10-K.  

Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant  

On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered into a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 and replace it with   a   GHG-free portfolio of energy efficiency, re  newables and energy storage.  The   Utility   expects that its   decision to retire Diablo Canyon   will a  ffect   the terms of the final s  ettlement agreement  between the Utility, the Central Coast Water Board and the California Attorney General s Office  .  Also, as   required under the California State Water Resources Control Board s Once-Through Cooling Water Policy,   beginning in 2016,   the Utility will pay an   annual   interim mitigation fee until operations cease at the end of the current licenses.    

PG E Corporation and the Utility believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the Utility s financial condi  tion or results of operations.  

For more information regarding the 2003 settlement agreement between the Central Coast Water Board  ,   the Utility  ,   and the California Attorney General s Office, see  Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings  in the 2015 Form 10-K.  

Venting Incidents in San Benito County 

As part of its regular maintenance and inspection practices for its natural gas transmission system, the Utility performs in-line inspections of pipelines using devices called  pigs  that travel through the pipeline to inspect and clean the walls of the pipe.  When in-line inspections are performed, natural gas in the pipeline must be released or vented at the pipeline station where the device is removed.  In February 2014, the Utility conducted an in-line inspection of a natural gas transmission pipeline that traverses San Benito County and vented the natural gas at the Utility s transmission station located in Hollister, which is next to an elementary school.  The Utility vented the natural gas during school hours on three occasions that month.  After being informed of the venting by the local air district, the San Benito County District Attorney notified the Utility in December 2014 that it was contemplating bringing a civil legal action against the Utility for violation of Health and Safety Code section 41700, which prohibits discharges of air contaminants that cause a public nuisance.  On October 28, 2015, the district attorney informed the Utility that it would seek civil penalties in excess of $100,000 but is willing to continue to explore settlement options with the Utility.  The Utility remains in settlement discussions with t  he district attorney s office.

Transformer Oil Release in Sonoma County  

During a rain storm in February 2015, transformer oil was released into an underground vault in the City of Santa Rosa, in Sonoma County, while a Utility crew was replacing a broken transformer.  Following further rains, the oil released from the vault and reached a nearby creek.  The event was investigated by Santa Rosa Fire Department, the local environmental enforcement authority, and later referred to the Sonoma County District Attorney s Office.  In May 2016, the District Attorney informed the Utility that it would seek penalties and costs in excess of $100,000 for alleged violations of several sections of the California Health and Safety and California Government codes which prohibit   unauthorized   spills   or   releases of oil into waters of the state and require that releases be reported to the   Office of Emergency Services.    The Utility is in the process of settlement negotiations with the Sonoma County District Attorney s Office  .    

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

For information about the significant risks that could affect PG E Corporation s and the Utility s future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, see the section of the 2015 Form 10-K entitled  Risk Factors,  as supplemented below, and the section of this quarterly report entitled  Forward-Looking Statements.  

PG E Corporation and the Utility may incur material liability in   connection with the Butte fire.  

In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the  Butte fire ) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.  On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire.  According to the Cal Fire s report, the fire bu  rned 70,868 acres, resulted in two   fatalities, and destroyed 5  49 homes, 368 outbuildings and four   commercial properties.  Cal Fire s report concluded that the wildfire was caused when a Gray Pine tree contacted the Utility s electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility and its vegetation management contractors to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree.  In a press release also issued on April 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million from the Utility.  

On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California for Sacramento County.  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.  The California Judicial Council had previously authorized the coordination of all cases in Sacramento County.  As of Septe  mber 30, 2016, approximately 50   complaints have been filed against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Super  ior Court of California in the Counties   of Calaveras  ,   San Francisco,   Sacramento, and Amador   involving approximately   1,850   individual plainti  ffs representing approximately 800   households and their insurance compa  nies.  These complaints are   part of   or are in the process of being added to   the two master complaints.  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability.  The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may increase in the future.    

In connection with this matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest and attorneys  fees without having been found negligent, through the theory of inverse condemnation.  In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent  .  

The process for estimating costs associated with claims relating to the Butte fire, including for estimated property damages, requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors.  As more information becomes known, including discoveries from the plaintiffs and results from the ongoing mediation and settlement process, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Butte fire may change.  A change in management s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material impact on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition and the results of operations during the period such change occurred.   

If the Utility records losses in connection with claims relating to the Butte fire that materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in the reporting periods during which additional charges are recorded, depending on whether the Utility is able to record or collect insurance recoveries in amounts sufficient to offset suc  h additional accruals during   such reporting periods.  

74    

PG E Corporation s and the Utility s future financial results   could   be materially affected by the   jury s verdict   in the federal criminal trial   and possible judgment of conviction of the Utility  , the debarment proceeding and an increased number of governmen  t investigations and requests for information.  

As previously disclosed, on   August 9, 2016, the jury returned its verdict in the federal criminal trial against the Utility on 11 felony counts alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integrity management, and identification of pipeline threats, and one felony count charging that the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident.  The jury acquitted the Utility on all six of the record-keeping allegations but found the Utility guilty on six felony counts that include obstructing a federal agency proceeding and violations of   pipeline   integrity management regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act.    On August 16, 2016, the Utility filed a motion under Federal Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for the six counts on which the jury returned a guilty verdict.   

In September 2015, the Utility was notified that the DOI had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs citing the   San  Bruno explosion and indicating, as the basis for   the   inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, poor identification and evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB s investigation.   

As a result of the August 9, 2016 jury s verdict in the federal criminal trial, the Utility updated its registration on the federal government s System for Award Management (SAM), a federal procurement da  tabase, to reflect the verdict.    Under federal law, the government may not enter into a contract with any corporation that was convicted of a felony criminal violation under any federal law within the preceding 24 months, where the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unless an agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination that this action is not necessary to protect the interests of the government.      Following the update of the SAM, the Utility and the DOI have been in discussions regarding such a determination and regarding a possible interim administrative agreement that would allow the federal government agencies to contract with the Utility while the DOI is completing its debarment inquiry. It is uncertain when and if the Utility and the DOI will enter into an interim administrative agreement. It is also uncertain when or if further action will be taken by the DOI.  The DOI debarment inquiry could result in the Utility s suspension or debarment from future federal government contracts for a fixed, specified time period or entering into an administrative agreement with the DOI to resolve debarment matters.  

As a result of the DOI inquiry and/or of the August 9, 2016 jury s guilty verdict on six felony counts in the federal criminal trial, the Utility may be required to implement remedial and other measures, such as a requirement that the Utility s natural gas operations and/or compliance and ethics programs be supervised by one or more independent third party monitor(s).  If appointed, the Utility expects a monitor or monitors would serve for a period of time and report periodically to the court or a department or agency of the government. 

The jury s verdict, a possible judgment of   conviction of the Utility and the outcome of the debarment proceeding could harm the Utility s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management.      Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regu  latory proceedings, for example   by  ,   enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty.  They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility s business is conducted or organized.       As discussed under the heading  Regulatory Matters      in   Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,   the SED continues evaluating PG E Corporation s and     the Utility s     organizational culture and governance in the CPUC s pending investigation to examine the Utility s safety culture.  The Utility also could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, to implement remedial   and other   measures that could be imposed.  

The Utility is also a target of an increased number of investigations and government   requests for information  .  As previously disclosed, the U.S. Attorney s Office is     investigating a natural gas explosion that occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014.      The U.S. Attorney s Office in San Francisco also continues to investigate matters relating to the criminal trial discussed above.      The U.S. Attorney s Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General s office also are investigating matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC person  nel. In addition, in October   2016, the Utility received a grand jury subpoena and letter from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California advising that the Utility is a target of a federal investigation regarding possible criminal violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and conspiracy to violate the act.      The Utility was also recently contacted by   certain   other federal agencies with requests for information.  While the Utility believes that these   requests for information   are routine, the  ir  outcome   is uncertain  .  The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations  , including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility.        Any charges   that could be brought against the Utility   or proceedings that could result   from the current and future government investigations and   requests for information   could result in material costs to PG E Corporation and the Utility.     

75    

The Utility s conviction, the outcome of the debarment proceeding and any proceedings that could result from the current and future governm  ent investigations and requests for information   could harm its relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management.      Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty.  

They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility s busine  ss is conducted or organized.    As discussed under the head  ing  Regulatory Matters      in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  , the SED continues evaluating PG E Corporation s and     the Utility s     organizational structure in the CPUC s pending investigation to examine the Utility s safety culture.  

The Utility s insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic event, or may   not become   available   at a reasonable cost, or available at all  .   

The Utility s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility s control.  (See  Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology  in Item 1A Risk Factors of the 2015 Form 10-K.)   Current insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.   (In particular, the Utility may incur material liability in connection with the Butte fire.  See  PG E Corporation and the Utility may incur material liability in connection with the Butte fire  above.)  

In addition, California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California for wildfire damages.  Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys' fees) for damages and takings as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including its electric transmission lines.  As a result of the strict liability standard applied to wildfires, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increase of wildfires including as a result of the ongoing drought, and the Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at comparable cost and terms as the Utility s current insurance coverage  ,   or at all.  In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.    

If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected. 

The Utility s operational and information technology systems could fail to function properly or be   improperly accessed or   damaged by third parties (including cyber  and   physical   attacks  ) or damaged by   severe weather, natural disasters, or other events. Any of these events could disrupt the Utility s operations and cause the Utility to incur unanticipated losses and expense or liability.   

The   operation of the Utility s extensive electricity and natural gas systems relies on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties.     All   of the Utility s   operational and   technology systems   and network infrastructure   are vulnerable to disability or failures   in the event of cyber   and physical   attacks  .    Cyber  attacks are increasingly sophisticated and may include computer hacking, viruses, malware, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware, destructive malware, or other means of disruption, destruction, or unauthorized access, acquisition or control.  In addition, hardware, software, or applications the Utility develops or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security.    Physical attacks may include   acts of sabotage, acts of war, acts of   terrorism  ,   or other physical acts.    The   Utility s   operational and information technology systems and networks   are deemed critical infrastructure, and any failure or decrease in their functionality   could  , among other things,   cause harm to the public or employees  ,   significantly disrupt operations  ,  negatively impact the Utility s ability to generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas, or otherwise operate in the most efficient manner or at all, undermine the Utility s performance of critical business functions,   damage the Utility s assets or operations or those of third parties  ,   and   lead to reputational harm  . As a result, such events could   subject the Utility to   significant expenses,   claims by customers or third parties,   govern  ment inquiries, investigations, and   regulatory actions that could result in fines and penalties, and loss of customers,   any of which could have a material effect on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial   condition and   results   of operations  .  

76    

The Utility s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, and updating, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction.      The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to   host,   maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist  ,   fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility s systems and information,   or   experience internal or external security incidents.      Any incidents,   disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification   of existing systems   or implementation of new systems could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues,   or   diversion of management s and employees  attention and resources,   or   negatively affect the Utility s ability to maintain effective financial controls   or   timely file required regulatory reports.      The Utility also could be subject to patent infringement claims arising from the use of third-party technology by the Utility or by a third-party vendor.   

In addition, the Utility s information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees.     A data breach involving   theft, improper disclosure  , or other unauthorized access to or acquisition   of confidential information   could   subject the Utility to penalties for   violation of applicable privacy   laws, claims   by   third parties,   and enforcement actions by government agencies.  It could also   reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the Utility s reputation  .   

The Utility and its third party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility s information technology systems, or confidential data, or to disrupt the Utility s operations.    N  one of these attempts   or breaches   has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on   PG E Corporation s and the Utility s   financial   condition and   results   of operations.    Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent the unauthorized access to its systems, infrastructure, or data, or the disruption of its operations, either of which could materially affect   PG E Corporation s and the Utility s   financial   condition and   results   of operations.   

While the Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by ins  urance or recoverable in rates  .  

The operation and decommissioning of the Utility s nuclear power plants expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire. 

The operation of the Utility s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act.  If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial results.  In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.  (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.)   

On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered into a proposal to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals.  However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel.  Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power.  Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete.  It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation.  As a result, operations at the Utility s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025.  In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG E Corporation and the Utility s financial results. 

The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.  (See  Regulatory Environment  in Item 1. Business in the 2015 Form 10-K.)  If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial results could be materially affected.  The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.  The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses e  xpire in 2024 and 2025.  At September   30, 2016, the Utility s unrecovered in  vestment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7   billion.  

77    

At the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.  If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge.  If the Utility obtains contingent approvals referred to herein that will result in retiring Diablo Canyon at the end of the current NRC operating licenses, the Utility will not be required to install cooling towers or implement alternative measures in order to comply with the California State Water Board Once-Through Cooling Water Policy, thus eliminating the risk of regulatory uncertainty regarding the measures that could have been imposed on the Utility or of incurring a material charge related thereto.  Even if the Utility is ultimately not required to install cooling towers, under the State Water Board s interim mitigation measures applicable to Diablo Canyon s operations prior to 2025, starting in 2016, it will be required to make payments to the California Coastal Conservancy to fund various environmental mitigation projects, that the Utility does not expect to exceed  $5 million per year.     

On June 28, 2016 the California State Lands Commission approved an extension of the Utility s leases of coastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon, to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon s current operating licenses.  The Utility will be required to obtain an additional lease extension from the State Lands Commission to cover the period of time necessary to decommission the facility.  The State Lands Commission and California Coastal Commission will evaluate appropriate environmental mitigation and development conditions associated with the decommissioning project, the costs of which could be substantial. 

The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of t  heir useful lives.  (See Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 herein and Note 2   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8   of the 2015 Form 10-K  .)  The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  If the Utility s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG E Corporation s and the Utility s financial results could be materially affected.  

78    

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  

During the quarter ended   September 30,   2016  , PG E Corporation made equity contributions totaling $  460   million to the Utility in order to maintain the 52% common equity component of   the Utility s   CPUC-authorized capital structure.  Neither PG E Corporation nor the Utility made any sales of unregistered equity securities during the quarter ended   September 30,   2016  .  

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

During the quarter ended  September 30,   2016  , PG E Corporation did not redeem or repurchase any shares of common stock outstanding.   During the quarter ended   September 30,   2016  , the Utility did not redeem or repurchase any shares of its various series of preferred stock outstanding.

 BYLAWS OF PG&E CORPORATION AMENDED AS OF SEPTEMBER 20, 2016

EXHIBIT 3.1

Bylaws

of

PG E Corporation

amended as of September 20, 2016 

Article I.

SHAREHOLDERS.

1.      Place of Meeting .  All meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the office of the Corporation in the City and County of San Francisco, State of California, or at such other place, within or without the State of California, as may be designated by the Board of Directors. 

2.      Annual Meetings .  The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board of Directors. 

Written notice of the annual meeting shall be given not less than ten (or, if sent by third class mail, thirty) nor more than sixty days prior to the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat.  The notice shall state the place, day, and hour of such meeting, and those matters which the Board, at the time of mailing, intends to present for action by the shareholders.

Notice of any meeting of the shareholders shall be given, by mail or telegraphic or other written communication, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the stock entitled to vote thereat, at his address, as it appears on the books of the Corporation.

At an annual meeting of shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the annual meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the annual meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder.  For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, including the nomination of any person (other than a person nominated by or at the direction of the Board) for election to the Board, the shareholder must have given timely and proper written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation pursuant to this Section or Section 3.  Other than director nominations pursuant to Section 3, to be timely, the shareholder's written notice must be received at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than forty-five days before the date corresponding to the mailing date of the notice and proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that if the annual meeting to which the shareholder's written notice relates is to be held on a date that differs by more than thirty days from the date of the last annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder's written notice to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is made or given to shareholders.  Any shareholder's written notice that is delivered after the close of business (5:00 p.m. local time) will be considered received on the following business day.  To be proper, the shareholder's written notice must set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (b) the name and address of the shareholder as they appear on the Corporation's books, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the shareholder, and (d) any material interest of the shareholder in such business.  In addition, other than director nominations pursuant to Section 3, if the shareholder's written notice relates to the nomination at the annual meeting of any person for election to the Board, such notice to be proper must also set forth (a) the name, age, business address, and residence address of each person to be so nominated, (b) the principal occupation or employment of each such person, (c) the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by each such person, and (d) such other information concerning each such person as would be required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such person as a Director, and must be accompanied by a consent, signed by each such person, to serve as a Director of the Corporation if elected.  Notwithstanding anything in the Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section and Section 3.

3.      Nominations of Directors Included in the Corporation's Proxy Materials . 

(a)      Inclusion of Shareholder Nominee in Proxy Statement .  Subject to the provisions of this Section       3, if expressly requested in the relevant Nomination Notice (as defined in Section 3(d) below), the Corporation shall include in its proxy statement for any annual meeting of shareholders (but not at any special meeting of shareholders):  (i) the name of any person nominated for election (the "Shareholder Nominee"), which shall also be included on the Corporation's form of proxy and ballot, by any Eligible Shareholder (as defined in Section 3(c)(i) below) or group of up to 20 Eligible Shareholders that, as determined by the Board of Directors or its designee acting in good faith, has (individually and collectively, in the case of a group) satisfied all applicable conditions and complied with all applicable procedures set forth in this Section 3 (such Eligible Shareholder or group of Eligible Shareholders being a "Nominating Shareholder"); (ii) disclosure about the Shareholder Nominee and the Nominating Shareholder required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable law to be included in the proxy statement; (iii) any statement included by the Nominating Shareholder in the Nomination Notice for inclusion in the proxy statement in support of the Shareholder Nominee's election to the Board of Directors (subject, without limitation, to Section 3(e)(ii), provided that such statement does not exceed 500 words; and (iv) any other information that the Corporation or the Board of Directors determines, in their discretion, to include in the proxy statement relating to the nomination of the Shareholder Nominee, including, without limitation, any statement in opposition to the nomination and any of the information provided pursuant to this Section 3. 

(b)      Maximum Number of Shareholder Nominees . 

(i)     The Corporation shall not be required to include in the proxy statement for an annual meeting of shareholders more Shareholder Nominees than that number of directors constituting 20 percent of the total number of directors of the Corporation on the last day on which a Nomination Notice may be submitted pursuant to this Section 3 (rounded down to the nearest whole number), but, in any event, not fewer than two (the "Maximum Number").  The Maximum Number for a particular annual meeting shall be reduced by:  (1) Shareholder Nominees whose nominations are subsequently withdrawn and (2) Shareholder Nominees whom the Board of Directors itself decides to nominate for election at such annual meeting.  In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the deadline set forth in Section 3(d) but before the date of the annual meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board in connection therewith, the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. 

(ii)     If the number of Shareholder Nominees pursuant to this Section 3 for any annual meeting of shareholders exceeds the Maximum Number, then, promptly upon notice from the Corporation, each Nominating Shareholder will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the proxy statement until the Maximum Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Corporation's common stock that each Nominating Shareholder disclosed as owned in its Nomination Notice, with the process repeated if the Maximum Number is not reached after each Nominating Shareholder has selected one Shareholder Nominee.  If, after the deadline for submitting a Nomination Notice as set forth in Section 2(d), a Nominating Shareholder becomes ineligible or withdraws its nomination, or a Shareholder Nominee becomes ineligible or unwilling to serve on the Board of Directors, whether before or after the mailing of the definitive proxy statement, then the Corporation:  (1) shall not be required to include in its proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy the Shareholder Nominee or any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the Nominating Shareholder or by any other Nominating Shareholder and (2) may otherwise communicate to its shareholders, including without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy statement or ballot or form of proxy, that the Shareholder Nominee will not be included as a Shareholder Nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy and will not be voted on at the annual meeting of shareholders. 

(c)     Eligibility of Nominating Shareholder . 

(i)     An "Eligible Shareholder" is a person who has either (1) been a record holder of the shares of common stock of the Corporation used to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 3(c) continuously for the three-year period specified in subsection (c)(ii) of this Section 3 below or (2) provides to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation, within the time period referred to in Section 3(d), evidence of continuous ownership of such shares for such three-year period from one or more securities intermediaries in a form that the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, determines acceptable. 

(ii)     An Eligible Shareholder or group of up to 20 Eligible Shareholders may submit a nomination in accordance with this Section 3 only if the person or group (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined in Section 3(c)(iii) below) (as adjusted for any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or similar events) of shares of the Corporation's common stock throughout the three-year period preceding and including the date of submission of the Nomination Notice, and continues to own at least the Minimum Number of shares through the date of the annual meeting of shareholders.  The following shall be treated as one Eligible Shareholder if such Eligible Shareholder shall provide together with the Nomination Notice documentation satisfactory to the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, that demonstrates compliance with the following criteria:  (1) funds under common management and investment control; (2) funds under common management and funded primarily by the same employer; or (3) a "family of investment companies" or a "group of investment companies" (each as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended).  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a nomination by a Nominating Shareholder that includes more than one Eligible Shareholder, any and all requirements and obligations for a given Eligible Shareholder or, except as the context otherwise makes clear, the Nominating Shareholder that are set forth in this Section 3, including the minimum holding period, shall apply to each member of such group; provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the aggregate ownership of the group of Eligible Shareholders constituting the Nominating Shareholder.  Should any Eligible Shareholder withdraw from a group of Eligible Shareholders constituting a Nominating Shareholder at any time prior to the annual meeting of shareholders, the Nominating Shareholder shall be deemed to own only the shares held by the remaining Eligible Shareholders.  As used in this Section 3, any reference to a "group" or "group of Eligible Shareholders" refers to any Nominating Shareholder that consists of more than one Eligible Shareholder and to all the Eligible Shareholders that make up such Nominating Shareholder. 

(iii)     The "Minimum Number" of shares of the Corporation's common stock means 3 percent of the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation as of the most recent date for which such amount is given in any filing by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the submission of the Nomination Notice. 

(iv)    For purposes of this Section 3, an Eligible Shareholder "owns" only those outstanding shares of the Corporation's common stock as to which such Eligible Shareholder possesses both:  (1) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to such shares and (2) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit from and the risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (1) and (2) shall not include any shares (x) sold by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (y) borrowed by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, or other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding capital stock of the Corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of: (A) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such Eligible Shareholder's or any of its affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (B) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree any gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates.  An Eligible Shareholder "owns" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Shareholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares.  An Eligible Shareholder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Shareholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the Eligible Shareholder.  An Eligible Shareholder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Shareholder has loaned such shares, provided that the Eligible Shareholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on not more than five business days' notice.  The terms "owned," "owning," and other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings.  Whether outstanding shares of the Corporation are "owned" for these purposes shall be determined by the Board of Directors or its designee acting in good faith.  For purposes of this Section 3(c)(iv), the term "affiliate" or "affiliates" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). 

(v)     No Eligible Shareholder shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting a Nominating Shareholder, and if any Eligible Shareholder appears as a member of more than one group, such Eligible Shareholder shall be deemed to be a member of only the group that has the largest ownership position as reflected in the Nomination Notice. 

(d)     Nomination Notice .  To nominate a Shareholder Nominee pursuant to this Section 3, the Nominating Shareholder must submit to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation all of the following information and documents in a form that the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, determines acceptable (collectively, the "Nomination Notice"), not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the date that the Corporation mailed its proxy statement for the prior year's annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that if (and only if) the annual meeting of shareholders is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences 30 days before the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting of shareholders and ends 30 days after the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting of shareholders (an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an "Other Meeting Date"), the Nomination Notice shall be given in the manner provided herein by the later of the close of business on the date that is 180 days prior to such Other Meeting Date or the tenth day following the date such Other Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed (in no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of the Nomination Notice): 

(i)     one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) calendar days prior to the date of the Nomination Notice, the Nominating Shareholder owns, and has continuously owned for the preceding three (3) years, the Minimum Number of shares, and the Nominating Shareholder's agreement to provide, within five (5) business days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying the Nominating Shareholder's continuous ownership of the Minimum Number of shares through the record date; 

(ii)     an agreement to provide immediate notice if the Nominating Shareholder ceases to own the Minimum Number of shares at any time prior to the date of the annual meeting; 

(iii)     a copy of the Schedule 14N (or any successor form) relating to the Shareholder Nominee, completed and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Nominating Shareholder as applicable, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules; 

(iv)     the written consent of each Shareholder Nominee to being named in the Corporation's proxy statement, form of proxy, and ballot as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; 

(v)     a written notice of the nomination of such Shareholder Nominee that includes the following additional information, agreements, representations, and warranties by the Nominating Shareholder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each group member in the case of a Nominating Shareholder consisting of a group of Eligible Shareholders):  (1) the information that would be required to be set forth in a shareholder's notice of nomination pursuant to Article I, Section 2 of these Bylaws; (2) the details of any relationship that existed within the past three years and that would have been described pursuant to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14N (or any successor item) if it existed on the date of submission of the Schedule 14N; (3) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder did not acquire, and is not holding, securities of the Corporation for the purpose or with the effect of influencing or changing control of the Corporation; (4) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the Board of Directors at the annual meeting any person other than such Nominating Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee(s); (5) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder has not engaged in and will not engage in a "solicitation" within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act (without reference to the exception in Section 14a-(l)(2)(iv)) with respect to the annual meeting, other than with respect to such Nominating Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee(s) or any nominee of the Board of Directors); (6) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder will not use any proxy card other than the Corporation's proxy card in soliciting shareholders in connection with the election of a Shareholder Nominee at the annual meeting; (7) a representation and warranty that the Shareholder Nominee's candidacy or, if elected, Board membership would not violate applicable state or federal law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Corporation's securities are traded (the "Stock Exchange Rules"); (8) a representation and warranty that the Shareholder Nominee:  (A) does not have any direct or indirect relationship with the Corporation that will cause the Shareholder Nominee to be deemed not independent pursuant to the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines and director independence standards and otherwise qualifies as independent under the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, director independence standards, and the Stock Exchange Rules; (B) meets the audit committee and compensation committee independence requirements under the Stock Exchange Rules; (C) is a "non-employee director" for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule); (D) is an "outside director" for the purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (or any successor provision); (E) is not and has not been subject to any event specified in Rule 506(d)(1) of Regulation D (or any successor rule) under the Securities Act of 1933 or Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or any successor rule) under the Exchange Act, without reference to whether the event is material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of the Shareholder Nominee; and (F) meets the director qualifications set forth in the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines; (9) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder satisfies the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 3(c); (10) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder will continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements described in Section 3(c) through the date of the annual meeting; (11) details of any position of the Shareholder Nominee as an officer or director of any competitor (that is, any entity that produces products or provides services that compete with or are alternatives to the principal products produced or services provided by the Corporation or its affiliates) of the Corporation, within the three years preceding the submission of the Nomination Notice; (12) if desired, a statement for inclusion in the proxy statement in support of the Shareholder Nominee's election to the Board of Directors, provided that such statement shall not exceed 500 words and shall fully comply with Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and (13) in the case of a nomination by a Nominating Shareholder comprised of a group, the designation by all Eligible Shareholders in such group of one Eligible Shareholder that is authorized to act on behalf of the Nominating Shareholder with respect to matters relating to the nomination, including withdrawal of the nomination; 

(vi)     an executed agreement pursuant to which the Nominating Shareholder (including in the case of a group, each Eligible Shareholder in that group) agrees:  (1) to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in connection with the nomination, solicitation, and election; (2) to file any written solicitation or other communication with the Corporation's shareholders relating to one or more of the Corporation's directors or director nominees or any Shareholder Nominee with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regardless of whether any such filing is required under any rule or regulation or whether any exemption from filing is available for such materials under any rule or regulation; (3) to assume all liability stemming from an action, suit, or proceeding concerning any actual or alleged legal or regulatory violation arising out of any communication by the Nominating Shareholder or the Shareholder Nominee nominated by such Nominating Shareholder with the Corporation, its shareholders, or any other person in connection with the nomination or election of directors, including, without limitation, the Nomination Notice; (4) to indemnify and hold harmless (jointly and severally with all other Eligible Shareholders, in the case of a group of Eligible Shareholders) the Corporation and each of its directors, officers, and employees individually against any liability, loss, damages, expenses, or other costs (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit, or proceeding, whether legal, administrative, or investigative, against the Corporation or any of its directors, officers, or employees arising out of or relating to a failure or alleged failure of the Nominating Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee to comply with, or any breach or alleged breach of, its, or his or her, as applicable, obligations, agreements, or representations under this Section 3; (5) in the event that any information included in the Nomination Notice, or any other communication by the Nominating Shareholder (including with respect to any Eligible Shareholder included in a group) with the Corporation, its shareholders, or any other person in connection with the nomination or election ceases to be true and accurate in all material respects (or due to a subsequent development omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made not misleading), to promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of discovering such misstatement or omission) notify the Corporation and any other recipient of such communication of the misstatement or omission in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct the misstatement or omission; and (6) in the event that the Nominating Shareholder (including any Eligible Shareholder included in a group) has failed to continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements described in Section 3(c), to promptly notify the Corporation; and 

(vii)     an executed agreement by the Shareholder Nominee:  (1) to provide to the Corporation such other information, including completion of the Corporation's director nominee questionnaire, as the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, may request; (2) that the Shareholder Nominee has read and agrees, if elected to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, to adhere to the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, and any other Corporation policies and guidelines applicable to directors; and (3) that the Shareholder Nominee is not and will not become a party to (A) any compensatory, payment or other financial agreement, arrangement, or understanding with any person or entity in connection with such person's nomination, candidacy, service, or action as director of the Corporation that has not been fully disclosed to the Corporation prior to or concurrently with the Nominating Shareholder's submission of the Nomination Notice, (B) any agreement, arrangement, or understanding with any person or entity as to how the Shareholder Nominee would vote or act on any issue or question as a director (a "Voting Commitment") that has not been fully disclosed to the Corporation prior to or concurrently with the Nominating Shareholder's submission of the Nomination Notice, or (C) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the Shareholder Nominee's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with his or her fiduciary duties under applicable law.

The Nomination Notice shall be deemed submitted on the date on which all of the information and documents referred to in this Section 3(d) (other than such information and documents contemplated to be provided after the date the Nomination Notice is provided) have been delivered to or, if sent by mail, received by the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation.

Within ten days of receiving the request in the proper form, the Board shall set a record date for the taking of such action by written consent in accordance with California Corporations Code Section 701 and Article IV, Section 1 of these Bylaws.  If the Board fails to set a record date within such ten-day period, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to give the written consent for the matters specified in the notice shall be the day on which the first written consent is given in accordance with California Corporations Code Section 701.

Each written consent delivered to the Corporation must set forth (a) the action sought to be taken, (b) the name and address of the shareholder as they appear on the Corporation's books, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the shareholder, (d) the name and address of the proxyholder authorized by the shareholder to give such written consent, if applicable, and (d) any material interest of the shareholder or proxyholder in the action sought to be taken.

Within three business days after receipt of the earliest dated consent solicited by the Soliciting Shareholders and delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided in California Corporations Code Section 603 or the determination by the Board of Directors of the Corporation that the Corporation should seek corporate action by written consent, as the case may be, the Corporate Secretary shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations.  The cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the Corporation.

Consents and revocations shall be delivered to the inspectors upon receipt by the Corporation, the Soliciting Shareholders or their proxy solicitors, or other designated agents.  As soon as consents and revocations are received, the inspectors shall review the consents and revocations and shall maintain a count of the number of valid and unrevoked consents.  The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not reveal the count to the Corporation, the Soliciting Shareholder or their representatives, or any other entity.  As soon as practicable after the earlier of (i) sixty days after the date of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided in California Corporations Code Section 603, or (ii) a written request therefor by the Corporation or the Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting consents), notice of which request shall be given to the party opposing the solicitation of consents, if any, which request shall state that the Corporation or Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents to authorize or take the action specified in the consents has been received in accordance with these Bylaws, the inspectors shall issue a preliminary report to the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders stating:  (a) the number of valid consents, (b) the number of valid revocations, (c) the number of valid and unrevoked consents, (d) the number of invalid consents, (e) the number of invalid revocations, and (f) whether, based on their preliminary count, the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents has been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents.

Unless the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders shall have forty-eight hours to review the consents and revocations and to advise the inspectors and the opposing party in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the preliminary report of the inspectors.  If no written notice of an intention to challenge the preliminary report is received within forty-eight hours after the inspectors' issuance of the preliminary report, the inspectors shall issue to the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders their final report containing the information from the inspectors' determination with respect to whether the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize and take the action specified in the consents.  If the Corporation or the Soliciting Shareholders issue written notice of an intention to challenge the inspectors' preliminary report within forty-eight hours after the issuance of that report, a challenge session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as promptly as practicable.  A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter.  Following completion of the challenge session, the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue their final report to the Soliciting Shareholders and the Corporation, which report shall contain the information included in the preliminary report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and a certification of whether the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents.  A copy of the final report of the inspectors shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded.

Unless the consent of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in writing, the Corporation shall give prompt notice to the shareholders in accordance with California Corporations Code Section 603 of the results of any consent solicitation or the taking of the corporate action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written consent.

3.      Committees.   The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors, designate and appoint one or more committees as the Board deems appropriate, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the Board; provided, however, that, as required by this Company's Articles of Incorporation, the members of the Executive Committee (should the Board of Directors designate an Executive Committee) must be appointed by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the authorized number of directors.  Any such committee, including the Executive Committee, shall have the authority to act in the manner and to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors designating such committee and may have all the authority of the Board of Directors, except with respect to the matters set forth in California Corporations Code Section 311. 

4.      Time and Place of Directors' Meetings.   Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held on such days and at such times and at such locations as shall be fixed by resolution of the Board, or designated by the Chairman of the Board or, in his absence, the Vice Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President of the Company and contained in the notice of any such meeting.  Notice of meetings shall be delivered personally or sent by mail or telegram at least seven days in advance. 

5.      Special Meetings.

7.      Action by Consent.   Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all Directors individually or collectively consent in writing to such action.  Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors. 

8.      Meetings by Conference Telephone.   Any meeting, regular or special, of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of Directors, may be held by conference telephone or similar communication equipment, provided that all Directors participating in the meeting can hear one another. 

9.      Majority Voting.   In any uncontested election, nominees receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) shall be elected.  In any election that is not an uncontested election, the nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them, up to the number of directors to be elected by those shares, shall be elected; votes against a director and votes withheld shall have no legal effect. 

For purposes of these Bylaws, "uncontested election" means an election of directors of the Company in which, at the expiration of the times fixed under Article I, Section 2 of these Bylaws requiring advance notification of director nominees, or for special meetings, at the time notice is given of the meeting at which the election is to occur, the number of nominees for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election.

The record date so fixed shall be not more than sixty nor less than ten days prior to the date of such meeting nor more than sixty days prior to any other action for the purposes for which it is so fixed.

Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, Transfer Agent, or Registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, Transfer Agent, or Registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Company with the same effect as if such person were an officer, Transfer Agent, or Registrar at the date of issue.

  2014 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT

The LTIP and Other Agreements

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and PG E Corporation regarding the Restricted Stock Units, subject to the terms of the LTIP.  Any prior agreements, commitments, or negotiations are superseded.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the LTIP, the LTIP will govern.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement are defined in the LTIP.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the PG E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy, this Agreement will govern. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with PG E Corporation means employment with any member of the Participating Company Group.

Grant of Restricted Stock Units

PG E Corporation grants you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown on the cover sheet of this Agreement.  The Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the LTIP.

Vesting of Restricted Stock Units

As long as you remain employed with PG E Corporation, the total number of Restricted Stock Units originally subject to this Agreement, as shown above on the cover sheet, will vest in accordance with the below vesting schedule (the "Normal Vesting Schedule")

210 on August 08, 2017

210 on August 08, 2018

210 on August 08, 2019

The amounts payable upon each vesting date are hereby designated separate payments for purposes of Code Section 409A.  Except as described below, all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement which have not vested upon termination of your employment will then be cancelled. As set forth below, the Restricted Stock Units may vest earlier upon the occurrence of certain events.

Dividends

Restricted Stock Units will accrue Dividend Equivalents in the event cash dividends are paid with respect to PG E Corporation common stock having a record date prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units are settled.  Such Dividend Equivalents will be converted into cash and paid, if at all, upon settlement of the underlying Restricted Stock Units.

Settlement

Vested Restricted Stock Units will be settled in an equal number of shares of PG E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction of Withholding Taxes, as described below.  PG E Corporation will issue shares as soon as practicable after the Restricted Stock Units vest in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule (but not later than sixty (60) days after the applicable vesting date); provided, however, that such issuance will, if earlier, be made with respect to all of your outstanding vested Restricted Stock Units (after giving effect to the vesting provisions described below) as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the earliest to occur of your (1) Disability (as defined under Code Section 409A), (2) death, or (3) "separation from service," within the meaning of Code Section 409A within 2 years following a Change in Control.

Voluntary Termination

In the event of your voluntary termination [(other than Retirement)], all unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled on the date of termination.

[Retirement

In the event of your Retirement, unvested Restricted Stock Units will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement; provided, however that in the event of your Retirement within 2 years following a Change in Control, all of your Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such Retirement.  Your termination of employment will be considered Retirement if you are both age 55 or older on the date of termination (other than termination for cause) and if you were employed by PG E Corporation for at least five consecutive years ending on the date of termination of your employment.]

Termination for Cause

If your employment with PG E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG E Corporation for cause, all unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled on the date of termination.  In general, termination for "cause" means termination of employment because of dishonesty, a criminal offense, or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG E Corporation.

Termination other than for Cause

If your employment with PG E Corporation is terminated by PG E Corporation other than for cause [or Retirement], any unvested Restricted Stock Units that would have vested within the 12 months following such termination had your employment continued will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  All other unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled unless your termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below.

Death/Disability

In the event of your death or Disability while you are employed, all of your Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such event.  If your death or Disability occurs following the termination of your employment and your Restricted Stock Units are then outstanding under the terms hereof, then all of your vested Restricted Stock Units plus any Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise vested during any continued vesting period hereunder will be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of your death or Disability.

Termination Due to Disposition of Subsidiary

(If your employment is terminated (other than termination for cause, [or]  your voluntary termination[, or your Retirement]) (1) by reason of a divestiture or change in control of a subsidiary of PG E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longer qualifying as a subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or (2) coincident with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary of PG E Corporation, then your Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled in the same manner as for a "Termination other than for Cause" described above.

Change in Control

In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror " ), may, without your consent, either assume or continue PG E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement.

If the Restricted Stock Units are neither assumed nor continued by the Acquiror or if the Acquiror does not provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units, all of your unvested Restricted Stock Units will vest immediately preceding and contingent on, the Change in Control and be settled in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule, subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.

Termination In Connection with a Change in Control

If you separate from service (other than termination for cause, [or] your voluntary termination[, or your Retirement]) in connection with a Change in Control within three months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Restricted Stock Units (including Restricted Stock Units that you would have otherwise forfeited after the end of the continued vesting period) will vest on the date of the Change in Control and will be settled in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed) subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.

In the event of such a separation in connection with a Change in Control within two years following the Change in Control, your Restricted Stock Units (to the extent they did not previously vest upon, for example, failure of the Acquiror to assume or continue this award) will vest on the date of such separation and will be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such separation.  PG E Corporation has the sole discretion to determine whether termination of your employment was made in connection with a Change in Control.

Delay

PG E Corporation will delay the issuance of any shares of common stock to the extent it is necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to certain "key employees" of certain publicly-traded companies); in such event, any shares of common stock to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period following the date of your "separation from service" under Section 409A (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following such separation) will instead be issued on the first business day following the expiration of the applicable delay period.

Withholding Taxes

The number of shares of PG E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive upon settlement of Restricted Stock Units will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG E Corporation, equal to the amount of any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by PG E Corporation  in connection with the Restricted Stock Units determined using the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates , including  social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax (" Withholding Taxes").  If the  withheld shares were not sufficient to satisfy your minimum Withholding Taxes, you will be required to pay, as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Withholding Taxes that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above  . 

Leaves of Absence

For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG E Corporation, or a recipient of PG E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will continue to be considered as employed.  If you do not return to active employment upon the expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination."

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration of such leave is not guaranteed by statute or contract, then you will be deemed to have had a "separation from service" for purposes of any Restricted Stock Units that are settled hereunder upon such separation.  To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least six (6) months and such impairment causes you to be unable to perform the duties of your position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, the six (6) month period in the prior sentence will be twenty-nine (29) months.

PG E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when your employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.

Voting and Other Rights

You will not have voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until the date the underlying shares are issued (as evidenced by appropriate entry on the books of PG E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent).

No Retention Rights

This Agreement is not an employment agreement and does not give you the right to be retained by PG E Corporation.  Except as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.

Recoupment of Awards

Awards are subject to recoupment in accordance with any applicable law and any recoupment policy adopted by the Corporation from time to time.

Applicable Law

This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of California.

PERFORMANCE SHARE AGREEMENT- FINANCIAL

The LTIP and Other Agreements

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and PG E Corporation regarding the Performance Shares, subject to the terms of the LTIP.  Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations are superseded.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the LTIP, the LTIP will govern.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement are defined in the LTIP. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the PG E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy, this Agreement will govern.  The LTIP provides the Committee with discretion to adjust the performance award formula.

For purposes of this Agreement, employment with PG E Corporation means employment with any member of the Participating Company Group.

Grant of

Performance Shares

PG E Corporation grants you the number of Performance Shares shown on the cover sheet of this Agreement (the "Performance Shares").  The Performance Shares are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the LTIP.

Vesting of Performance Shares

Settlement in Shares/

Performance Goals

As long as you remain employed with PG E Corporation, the Performance Shares will vest upon, and to the extent of, the Committee's certification of the extent to which performance goals have been attained for this award, which certification will occur on or after January 1 but before March 15 of the third year following the calendar year of grant specified in the cover sheet (the "Vesting Date").  Except as described below, all Performance Shares that have not vested will be cancelled upon termination of your employment.

Vested Performance Shares will be settled in shares of PG E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction of Withholding Taxes, as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplying the number of vested Performance Shares by the "rounded payout percentage" determined as follows (except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement), rounded to the nearest whole number:

Upon the Vesting Date, PG E Corporation's total shareholder return ("TSR") will be compared to the TSR of the fourteen other companies in PG E Corporation's comparator group (1)  for the prior three calendar years, consisting of 2016, 2017, and 2018 (the "Performance Period"). (2)   Subject to rounding considerations, if PG E Corporation's TSR falls below the 25 th  percentile of the comparator group the payout percentage will be 0%; if PG E Corporation's TSR is at the 25 th  percentile, the payout percentage will be 25%; if PG E Corporation's TSR is at the 60 th  percentile, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if PG E Corporation's TSR is in the 90 th  percentile or higher, the payout percentage will be 200%.  If PG E Corporation's TSR performance is between the 25 th  percentile and the target, or between the target and the 90 th  percentile, the rounded payout percentage is determined by straight-line interpolation between the performance percentile associated with each comparator rank and between the rounded payouts

associated with each performance percentile (including the 25 th , 60 th , and 90 th  percentiles) as shown in above table, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

(1)   The current Performance Comparator Group consists of the following companies:  Ameren Corporation, American Electric Power, CMS Energy,  

Consolidated Edison, Inc., DTE Energy, Duke Energy, Edison International, Eversource Energy, NiSource, Inc., Pinnacle West Capital, 

SCANA Corp., Southern Company, Wisconsin Energy Corporation, and Xcel Energy, Inc.  PG E Corporation reserves the right to change the 

companies comprising the comparator group and the resulting payout percentage table in accordance with the rules established by PG E 

Corporation in connection with this award.

(2)   PG E Corporation's TSR performance is measured by the value of stock price appreciation and dividends paid and reinvested, relative 

to companies in the Performance Comparator Group.  For these purposes, average share price will be measured by comparing the average

per share closing price of PG E Corporation common stock during the 20 trading days before the beginning and the end of the Performance

Period.

The following table sets forth the rounded payout percentages for the TSR rankings that could be achieved by companies within the comparator group:

The payout percentage, if any, will be determined as soon as practicable following the date that the Committee (or a subcommittee of that Committee) or an equivalent body certifies the extent to which performance goals have been attained, pursuant to Section 10.5(a) of the LTIP.  PG E Corporation will issue shares as soon as practicable after such determination, but no earlier than the Vesting Date, and not later than March 15 of the calendar year following completion of the Performance Period.

Dividends

Each time that PG E Corporation declares a dividend on its shares of common stock, an amount equal to the dividend multiplied by the number of Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf.  If you receive a Performance Share settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

Voluntary Termination

If you terminate your employment with PG E Corporation voluntarily before the Vesting Date (other than for Retirement), all of the Performance Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares will be forfeited.

Termination for Cause

If your employment with PG E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG E Corporation for cause before the Vesting Date, all of the Performance Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares will be forfeited.  In general, termination for "cause" means termination of employment because of dishonesty, a criminal offense, or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG E Corporation.

Termination other than for Cause

If your employment with PG E Corporation is terminated by PG E Corporation other than for cause or Retirement before the Vesting Date, a portion of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest proportionally based on the number of months during the Performance Period that you were employed (rounded down) divided by the number of months in the Performance Period (36 months).  All other outstanding Performance Shares will be cancelled, and any associated accrued dividends will be forfeited, unless your termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below. Your vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your vested Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

Retirement

If you retire before the Vesting Date, your outstanding Performance Shares will continue to vest as though your employment had continued and will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period based on the same payout percentage applicable to active employees.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.  Your termination of employment will be considered a Retirement if you are age 55 or older on the date of termination (other than termination for cause) and if you were employed by PG E Corporation for at least five consecutive years ending on the date of termination of your employment.

Death/Disability

If your employment terminates due to your death or disability before the Vesting Date, all of your Performance Shares will vest immediately and will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

Termination Due to Disposition of Subsidiary

If your employment is terminated (other than for cause, your voluntary termination, or Retirement) (1) by reason of a divestiture or change in control of a subsidiary of PG E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longer qualifying as a subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (2) coincident with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary of PG E Corporation, then your outstanding Performance Shares will vest and be settled in the same manner as for a "Termination other than for Cause" described above.

Change in Control

In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror " ), may, without your consent, either assume or continue PG E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject to this Agreement.

If the Acquiror assumes or continues PG E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes a substantially equivalent award, TSR will be calculated by combining (a) the TSR of PG E Corporation for the period from January 1 of the year of grant to the date of the Change in Control, and (b) the TSR of the Acquiror from the date of the Change in Control to the last day of the Performance Period. The number of shares, if any, you are entitled to receive upon settlement of the assumed, continued or substituted Performance Share award will be  determined based on the rounded payout percentage reflected in the table set forth above for the highest percentile TSR performance met or exceeded when calculated on that basis, and considering any adjustments to the comparator group.  Settlement will occur as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

If the Change in Control of PG E Corporation occurs before the Vesting Date, and if this award is neither assumed nor continued by the Acquiror or if the Acquiror does not provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject to this Agreement, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest and become nonforfeitable on the date of the Change in Control.  Such vested Performance Shares will be settled   , if at all, as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  The payout percentage, if any, will be based on TSR for the period from January 1 of the year of grant to the date of the Change in Control compared to the TSR of the other companies in PG E Corporation's comparator group for the same period. At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares to the date of the Change in Control multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

Termination In Connection with a Change in Control

If your employment is terminated by PG E Corporation other than for cause in connection with a Change in Control within two years following the Change in Control, all of your outstanding Performance Shares (to the extent they did not previously vest upon failure of the Acquiror to assume or continue this award) will vest and become nonforfeitable on the date of termination of your employment.

If your employment is terminated by PG E Corporation other than for cause in connection with a Change in Control within three months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest       in full  and become nonforfeitable  (including the portion that you would have otherwise forfeited based on the proration of vested Performance Shares through the date of termination of your employment)  as of the date of the Change in Control.

Your vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees (determined consistent with the method described above under "Change in Control"). At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your vested Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.       PG E Corporation has the sole discretion to determine whether termination of your employment was made in connection with a Change in Control.

Withholding Taxes

The number of shares of PG E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive upon settlement of your Performance Shares will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG E Corporation, equal to the amount of any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by PG E Corporation  in connection with the Performance Shares determined using the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates , including  social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax (" Withholding Taxes").  If the  withheld shares were not sufficient to satisfy your minimum Withholding Taxes, you will be required to pay, as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Withholding Taxes that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above  . 

Leaves of Absence

For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG E Corporation, or a recipient of PG E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will continue to be considered as employed.  If you do not return to active employment upon the expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination."

PG E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when your employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.

No Retention Rights  
 
  This Agreement is not an employment agreement and does not give you the right to be retained by PG E Corporation.  Except as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.

Recoupment of Awards  
 
  Awards are subject to recoupment in accordance with any applicable law and any recoupment policy adopted by the Corporation from time to time.

Applicable Law 
  This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of California.

The LTIP and Other Agreements

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and PG E Corporation regarding the Performance Shares, subject to the terms of the LTIP.  Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations are superseded.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the LTIP, the LTIP will govern.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement are defined in the LTIP. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the PG E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy, this Agreement will govern.

For purposes of this Agreement, employment with PG E Corporation means employment with any member of the Participating Company Group.

Grant of

Settlement in Shares/

Performance Goals

As long as you remain employed with PG E Corporation, the Performance Shares will vest upon, and to the extent of, the Committee's certification of the extent to which performance goals have been attained for this award, which certification will occur on or after January 1 but before March 15 of the third year following the calendar year of grant specified in the cover sheet (the "Vesting Date").  Except as described below, all Performance Shares that have not vested will be cancelled upon termination of your employment.

Vested Performance Shares will be settled in shares of PG E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction of Withholding Taxes, as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplying the number of vested Performance Shares by the "payout percentage" determined as follows (except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement), rounded to the nearest whole number:

Fifty percent of the Performance Shares have a safety performance goal and resulting safety payout percentage, and the other fifty percent of the Performance Shares have an affordability performance goal and resulting affordability payout percentage.  Subject to rounding considerations, in each case, if performance is below threshold, the payout percentage will be 0%; if performance is at threshold, the payout percentage will be 25%; if performance is at target, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if performance is at or better than maximum, the payout percentage will be 200%.  The actual payout percentage for performance between threshold and maximum will be determined based on linear interpolation between the payout percentages for threshold and target, or target and maximum, as appropriate.

The measures and goals are discussed in more detail below:

Safety   - At the end of 2018, PG E Corporation's lost workday ("LWD") case rate ("LWD Rate") for that year will be measured as the number of LWD cases incurred per 200,000 hours worked during 2018. LWD cases will be measured in the same manner as for the 2016 Short-Term Incentive Plan, will include OSHA recordable incidents that result in loss of at least one workday, and will exclude fatalities.  Threshold performance is 0.247, target performance is 0.215, and maximum performance is 0.201.

Affordability   - PG E Corporation's affordability performance will be measured as the reduction in standard rate case expense for unitized work and support operations and maintenance costs over the three calendar years prior to the normal Vesting Date (the "Performance Period"), as compared to escalated actual costs in these areas for 2014, escalated by two years (at 2.75 perent per year) , as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee in accordance with the terms adopted by the Committee at its February 16, 2016 meeting.  Threshold performance is $75 million, target performance is $100 million, and maximum performance is $200 million.

The final payout percentages, if any, will be determined as soon as practicable following the date that the Committee (or a subcommittee of that Committee) or an equivalent body certifies the extent to which the performance goals have been attained, pursuant to Section 10.5(a) of the LTIP.  PG E Corporation will issue shares as soon as practicable after such determination, but no earlier than the Vesting Date, and not later than March 15 of the calendar year following completion of the Performance Period.

Dividends

Each time that PG E Corporation declares a dividend on its shares of common stock, an amount equal to the dividend multiplied by the number of Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf.  If you receive a Performance Share settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

Voluntary Termination

If you terminate your employment with PG E Corporation voluntarily before the Vesting Date (other than for Retirement), all of the Performance Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares will be forfeited.

If your employment with PG E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG E Corporation for cause before the Vesting Date, all of the Performance Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares will be forfeited.  In general, termination for "cause" means termination of employment because of dishonesty, a criminal offense, or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG E Corporation.

Termination other than for Cause

If your employment with PG E Corporation is terminated by PG E Corporation other than for cause or Retirement before the Vesting Date, a portion of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest proportionally based on the number of months during the Performance Period that you were employed (rounded down) divided by the number of months in the Performance Period (36 months).  All other outstanding Performance Shares will be cancelled, and any associated accrued dividends will be forfeited, unless your termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below. Your vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your vested Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

Termination Due to Disposition of Subsidiary

Change in Control

In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror " ), may, without your consent, either assume or continue PG E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject to this Agreement.

If the Acquiror assumes or continues PG E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes a substantially equivalent award, Performance Shares will vest on the Vesting Date, and performance will be deemed to have been achieved at target, resulting in a payout percentage of 100%. Settlement will occur as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by a payout percentage of 100%.

If the Change in Control of PG E Corporation occurs before the Vesting Date, and if this award is neither assumed nor continued by the Acquiror or if the Acquiror does not provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject to this Agreement, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest and become nonforfeitable on the date of the Change in Control.  Such vested Performance Shares will be settled   , if at all, as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  Performance will be deemed to have been achieved at target and the payout percentage will be 100%. At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares to the date of the Change in Control multiplied by a payout percentage of 100%.

Termination In Connection with a Change in Control

If  your employment is terminated by PG E Corporation other than for cause in connection with a Change in Control within two years following the Change in Control, all of your outstanding Performance Shares (to the extent they did not previously vest upon failure of the Acquiror to assume or continue this award) will vest and become nonforfeitable on the date of termination of your employment. 

If your employment is terminated by PG E Corporation other than for cause in connection with a Change in Control within three months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest      in full and become nonforfeitable (including the portion that you would have otherwise forfeited based on the proration of vested Performance Shares through the date of termination of your employment) as of the date of the Change in Control. 

Your vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date but no later than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees (which in this case will be deemed to be at target, consistent with the "Change in Control" section, above).  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your vested Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.         PG E Corporation has the sole discretion to determine whether termination of your employment was made in connection with a Change in Control. 

Withholding Taxes

T he number of shares of PG E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive upon settlement of your Performance Shares will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG E Corporation, equal to the amount of any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by PG E Corporation  in connection with the Performance Shares determined using the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates , including  social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax (" Withholding Taxes").  If the  withheld shares were not sufficient to satisfy your minimum Withholding Taxes, you will be required to pay, as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Withholding Taxes that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above  .  

Leaves of Absence

For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG E Corporation, or a recipient of PG E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will continue to be considered as employed.  If you do not return to active employment upon the expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination."

PG E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when your employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.

No Retention Rights

This Agreement is not an employment agreement and does not give you the right to be retained by PG E Corporation.  Except as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.

Recoupment of Awards

Awards are subject to recoupment in accordance with any applicable law and any recoupment policy adopted by the Corporation from time to time.

Applicable Law

This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of California.
