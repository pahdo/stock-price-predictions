NOTE 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
 Great Basin Scientific, Inc. (the  Company ) (d.b.a., Great Basin Corporation) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Company was originally incorporated as Diagnostic Micro Arrays, Inc., a Nevada corporation, on June 27, 2003. The Company changed its name to Great Basin Scientific, Inc. on April 19, 2006. On August 12, 2008, the Company took steps to change its corporate domicile from Nevada to Delaware by forming Great Basin Scientific, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and on August 29, 2008, Great Basin Scientific, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was merged with and into Great Basin Scientific, Inc., a Delaware corporation, wherein the Delaware corporation was the sole surviving entity.  
 The Company is a molecular diagnostic testing company focused on the development and commercialization of its patented, molecular diagnostic platform designed to test for infectious disease, especially hospital-acquired infections. The Company believes that small to medium sized hospital laboratories, those under 400 beds, are in need of simpler and more affordable molecular diagnostic testing methods. The Company markets a system that combines both affordability and ease-of-use, when compared to other commercially available molecular testing methods, which it believes will accelerate the adoption of molecular testing in small to medium sized hospitals. The system includes an analyzer, which is provided for our customers  use without charge in the United States, and a diagnostic cartridge, which is sold to our customers. The testing platform has the capability to identify up to 64 individual targets at one time. If the test identifies one to three targets, they are referred to as low-plex tests, or tests, and if they identify four or more targets they are referred to as multi-plex panels, or panels. The Company currently has four commercially available tests, the first for clostridium difficile, or  C. diff , which received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in April 2012, the second for Group B Strep, which received clearance from the FDA in April 2015 and launched commercially in June 2015, the third for Shiga Toxin producing  E. coli  or STEC, which received clearance from the FDA in March 2016 and launched commercially in August 2016 and the fourth for Staphylococcus Identification and Resistance Panel, or Staph ID/R panel, which  FDA clearance in March 2016 and launched commercially in September 2016. Our customers consist of hospitals, clinics, laboratories and other healthcare providers in the United States, the European Union and New Zealand. 

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
  Basis of Presentation   
 These condensed unaudited financial statements have been prepared to reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. The accompanying condensed financial statements and notes are unaudited. In management s opinion, the unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and include all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016, its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or any other interim period.  
  Net Income (Loss) per Common Share   
 Basic loss per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net loss (the numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period (the denominator). Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding (if dilutive) during each period. Potential common shares include convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock options and warrants. The number of potential common shares outstanding is computed using the treasury stock method. 
 As the Company has incurred losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the potentially dilutive shares are anti-dilutive and are thus not added into the loss per share calculations. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were 51,002,236 and 272 potentially dilutive shares, respectively .  
 The Company had net income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and therefore potentially dilutive shares must be added into the diluted net income (loss) per share calculations. 
 6 

The components of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the three months ended September 30, 2015 are as follows:  

Reverse Stock Split   
 On March 30, 2016, the Company effected a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock whereby each thirty-five shares of common stock were replaced with one share of common stock (with no fractional shares issued). On September 16, 2016, the Company effected another reverse stock split of the Company s common stock whereby each eighty shares of common stock were replaced with one share of common stock (with no fractional shares issued).  The par value and the number of authorized shares of the common stock were not adjusted. All common share and per share amounts for all periods presented in these financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect these reverse stock splits. The quantity of Series E Preferred Stock and all warrants and employee and other options were not included in the reverse stock split and their outstanding quantities have not been adjusted. However, the conversion and exchange ratios were adjusted for the effect of the reverse stock splits such that upon conversion each 168,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock will now be converted into four shares of common stock and each 168,000 of Class A, Class B, Series B, common warrants and options will now be exercisable into one share of common stock. The Series D and 2015 Subordination Warrants conversion ratio has been adjusted such that each 2,800 of the Series D and Subordination Warrants will now be exercisable into one share of common stock.  The Series G, Series H and 2016 Subordination Warrants conversion ratio has been adjusted such that each 80 of the Series G, Series H and 2016 Subordination Warrants will now be exercisable into one share of common stock (see NOTE 10 WARRANTS).

Fair Value of F  inancial Instruments  
 Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under FASB ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under FASB ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, with the first two inputs considered observable and the last input considered unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value as follows:  

Level one     Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;      

Level two     Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and      

Level three     Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.      

 Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company issued certain common stock warrants, employee stock options and convertible notes that are required to be recorded at fair value measured at the transaction date. In addition, certain other warrants to purchase common stock and convertible notes qualify as derivative liabilities and are therefore required to be recorded at fair value measured at the transaction date and again at each reporting period end. The fair value of these warrants and conversion was determined using estimates and assumptions that are not readily available in public markets and the Company has designated this liability as Level 3. The assumptions used for the fair value calculation as well as the changes in the value of the derivative liability are shown in NOTE 11 DERIVATIVE LIABILITY.  
  Derivative Instruments   
 The Company accounts for derivative instruments under the provisions of ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging . ASC 815 requires the Company to record derivative instruments at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings. As a result of certain terms, conditions and features included in certain common stock warrants granted by the Company as well as the conversion features in the convertible notes, those provisions are required to be accounted for as derivatives at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements   
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements upon adoption.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02  Leases , which requires recognition of leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  This update is effective for annual periods and interim periods with those periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements. 
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03  Interest   Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost.  This standard provides guidance on the balance sheet presentation for debt issuance costs and debt discounts and debt premiums. To simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, this standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted this standard and the effects are reflected in its financial statements and related disclosures. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going  
 8 

concern. The update is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and inter  im periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The impact on the Company s financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-15 is currently being assessed by management.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09    Revenue from Contracts with Custo mers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which clarified various aspects of the core principle in ASU No. 2014-09 pertaining to identifying promised goods and services.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which clarified certain consideration collectability requirements described in ASU No. 2014-09.  All three standards are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, and shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  In April 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact of adoption of the provisions of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 on its financial statements. 

NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN 
 The Company s condensed unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company has incurred substantial losses from operations and negative operating cash flows which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company sustained a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $83.0 million and a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $57.9 million, and has an accumulated deficit of $204.9 million as of September 30, 2016. We have limited liquidity and have not yet established a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs and development needs. Accordingly, our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate greater revenue through increased sales and/or our ability to raise additional funds through the capital markets.  Whether and when the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations or obtain additional financing is uncertain. 
 The Company has been able to obtain financing in order to fund its short term working capital and development needs. In February 2016, the Company obtained financing by completing a follow-on offering for net proceeds of $5.0 million.  In May 2016, holders of the senior secured convertible notes issued in 2015 voluntarily agreed to remove restrictions on the Company s use of $2.0 million previously funded to the Company and authorized the release of those funds from the restricted cash accounts of the Company. In June 2016, the Company obtained additional financing by completing another follow-on offering for net proceeds of $5.3 million. In July 2016, the Company issued additional senior secured convertible notes and received $68.0 million in total gross proceeds, of which $5.4 million in net proceeds was immediately available to the Company and $62.0 million was placed in restricted accounts. In September 2016, holders of the senior secured convertible notes issued in 2015 voluntarily agreed to remove restrictions on the Company s use of $4.7 million previously funded to the Company and authorized the release of those funds from the restricted cash accounts of the Company. 
 The Company has been able to obtain financing in the past to meet its short-term needs through private placements of convertible preferred securities, the sale and leaseback of equipment, an initial public offering ( IPO ), additional follow-on offerings, and convertible debt financings. The Company will continue to seek funding through the issuance of additional equity securities or debt financing, or a combination of the two. Any proceeds received from these items could provide the needed funds for continued operations and development programs. The Company can provide no assurance that it will be able to obtain sufficient additional financing that it needs to alleviate doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is able to obtain sufficient additional financing proceeds, the Company cannot be certain that this additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, the Company s stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact the Company s ability to conduct business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financings, the impact on the Company s operations will be material and adverse.  

NOTE 4 LEASE COMMITMENTS 
  Capital Leases  
 The Company has entered into two lease agreements for the sale-leaseback of molecular diagnostic analyzers. The first agreement was entered into in November 2013 and provided for the sale of 125 molecular diagnostic analyzers for a sales price of $2,500,000, which  
 9 

are being leased back for a base period of thirty-six monthly payments of $74,875. The second agreement was entered into in April 2014 for the sale of 75 molecular diagnostic analyzers for a sales price of $1,500,000, which are being leased ba  ck for a base period of twenty-four monthly payments of $64,665. At the end of each lease term, the leases shall automatically renew for twelve additional months unless certain conditions are met. As such, the Company is amortizing the capital lease over a   forty-eight month period for the first agreement and a thirty-six month period for the second agreement. The leases are accounted for as a capital lease sale-leaseback transaction in accordance with ASC 840,  Leases .  
 In July 2016, the Company entered into a lease agreement for equipment in the amount of $80,138 with monthly payments of $1,543 over a 5 year period.  The lease contains a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease and accordingly the lease is accounted for as a capital lease in accordance with ASC 840,  Leases . 
  Operating Leases  
 The Company leases approximately 35,540 square feet of office space located in Salt Lake City, Utah for use as the executive offices and labs. Base rent payments due under the lease are expected to be approximately $3,472,875 in the aggregate over the term of the lease of 65 months that began on December 1, 2015. The Company also leases approximately 33,000 square feet of building space at another location in Salt Lake City, Utah for use primarily as manufacturing space and labs. Base rent payments due under these leases total $21,226 per month. The leases expire on April 30, 2017.  The Company also leases certain office equipment such as copiers and printers under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates. 
 Amounts charged to expense under operating leases were $237,376 and $66,514 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $640,741 and $210,416 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 5 NOTES PAYABLE  
   
 The Company purchased certain machinery and equipment under two note payable agreements in January and February 2013. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, both notes were extinguished by making the final payments on the notes in the amount of $5,693. 

NOTE 6 CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 
  December 2015 Transaction  
 On December 30, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with certain investors pursuant to which it agreed to issue $22.1 million in senior secured convertible notes ( 2015 Notes ) and Series D Warrants (further described below). $20 million of the 2015 Notes were issued for cash proceeds totaling $18.4 million with an original issue discount in the amount of $1.6 million which is equal to sixteen (16) months of simple interest at a rate of six percent (6.0%) per annum on the aggregate principal of the 2015 Notes (assuming, that the entire aggregate original principal amount remains outstanding through the maturity date). $2.1 million of the 2015 Notes were issued to extinguish 1,050,000 outstanding Series C Warrants at an extinguishment value of $2.00 per warrant. The 2015 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and will rank senior to all outstanding and future indebtedness of the Company. They are secured by a first priority perfected security interest (subject to permitted liens as defined in the 2015 Notes) in all of the current and future assets of the Company. The 2015 Notes contain standard and customary events of default and the entire principal balance is subject to the default and redemption provisions contained in the 2015 Notes, regardless of whether or not any of the proceeds have been released from the Company s restricted accounts.  
 In connection with the issuance of the 2015 Notes under the SPA, the Company issued Series D Warrants (the  Series D Warrants ), exercisable to acquire 1,252 shares of Common Stock and Subordination Warrants (the  2015 Subordination Warrants ), exercisable to acquire 38 shares of Common Stock, both which are subject to a one time adjustment on December 31, 2016 under the terms of the Series D and 2015 Subordination Warrants (see NOTE 10 WARRANTS). Each Series D and 2015 Subordination Warrant became exercisable by the holder beginning six months after December 30, 2015 and continues for a period five years thereafter. The Series D and 2015 Subordination Warrants have a provision that adjusts the exercise price upon certain dilutive events. As of September 30, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement, the exercise price of the Series D and 2015 Subordination Warrants has been adjusted such that the exercise of 2,800 warrants with an aggregate exercise price of $126.40 will result in the issuance of one share of common stock. 
 The Company has agreed to make amortization payments with respect to the 2015 Notes in twelve (12) equal installments beginning four (4) months after the original date of issuance of December 30, 2015 (each, an  Installment Date ). On each installment date, assuming certain equity conditions are met, the installment payment shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate defined in the agreement.  As of April 29, 2016, the Company was  not able to bring a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the 2015 Notes effective and therefore did not satisfy the equity   
 10 

conditions under the 2015 Notes to permit settlement of installment payments through conversion int  o shares of common stock.   T  he holders of the 2015 Notes deferred the three installment payments due on April 29, 2016, May 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively to the installment payment with a due date of July 29, 2016. During the three months ended S  eptember 30, 2016, approximately $8.0 million of installment payments (through the conversion into 2,119,366 shares of common stock) were made bringing the principal note balance of the 2015 Notes down to approximately $14.1 million.  Given the conversion   feature is bifurcated from the host instrument, conversions are deemed to be extinguishments for accounting purposes and accordingly, a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $17,292,463 was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2  016.    
 A summary of the accounting for these extinguishments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

Under the terms of the 2015 Notes, at closing the Company received an initial tranche of $4.6 million for immediate use for general corporate purposes. The remaining cash proceeds of $13.8 million was held in restricted accounts to be released to the Company from the Company s restricted accounts in subsequent equal tranches subject to certain equity conditions.  In May 2016 and August 2016, the holders of the 2015 Notes voluntarily removed restrictions on the Company s use of an aggregate of $2.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, that was previously funded to the Company and authorized the release of those funds from the restricted cash accounts of the Company. As of September 30, 2016 the remaining cash in the amount of $7.1 million is still being held in a restricted account and will be released to the Company subject to certain equity conditions.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the 2015 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at $126.40 per share.  The Company has a conversion right related to the required installment payments where the Company can convert the installment payments at the lower of 80% of the arithmetic average of the lower of: (A) the 3 lowest volume weighted average price (VWAP) days in the prior 20 days or (B) the VWAP of the common stock on the trading day preceding the applicable date of determination.  Both the conversion right of the holder and the Company is subject to a reset clause if the Company issues or sells common stock at a lower price than the applicable conversion rate at such time with both conversion features being subject to a $0.20 floor.  At September 30, 2016, the most advantageous conversion term is a conversion price of $1.87 which would convert the remaining principal of the 2015 Note into 7,547,317 shares of common stock.   
 The Company determined the conversion feature in the 2015 Notes represents an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation due to the ratchet provision described above related to the conversion feature. The provisions in the Series D Warrants also require the Company to account for the warrants as derivative liabilities. The original issue discount, the fair value of the embedded conversion feature, the fair value of the Series D Warrants and the debt issuance costs are all together considered the debt discount. The Company recorded a debt discount in the amount of $20 million which is being amortized over the life of the 2015 Notes using the effective interest method. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $14,950,080 of the debt discount had been amortized to interest expense and $2,508,882 of the debt discount has been extinguished through the conversions during the period. 
 The following table summarizes the 2015 Notes outstanding at September 30, 2016:    

July 2016 Transaction  
 On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( July SPA ) with certain investors pursuant to which it agreed to issue $75 million in senior secured convertible notes ( 2016 Notes ) and Series H Warrants (further described below). The 2016 Notes were originally convertible into 468,750 shares of Common Stock at a price equal to $160.00 per share, subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events. The 2016 Notes were issued for cash proceeds totaling $68.0 million with an original issue discount in the amount of $7.0 million with no stated interest rate.  The 2016 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and  
 11 

will rank senior to all outstanding and future indebtedness of the Company. They are secured by a first priority perfected security interest (subject to the priority interest of the 2015 N  otes and permitted liens as defined in the 2016 Notes) in all of the current and future assets of the Company. The 2016 Notes contain standard and customary events of default and the entire principal balance is subject to the default and redemption provisi  ons contained in the 2016 Notes, regardless of whether or not any of the proceeds have been released from the Company s restricted accounts.   
 In connection with the issuance of the 2016 Notes under the July SPA, the Company issued Series H Warrants (the  Series H Warrants ), exercisable to acquire 703,125 shares of Common Stock and Subordination Warrants (the  2016 Subordination Warrants ), exercisable to acquire 21,094 shares of Common Stock (see NOTE 10 WARRANTS). The Series H and 2016 Subordination Warrants become exercisable by the holder beginning six months after July 1, 2016 and continues for a period five years thereafter. The Series H and 2016 Subordination Warrants also have a provision that adjusts the exercise price upon certain dilutive events.  As of September 30, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement, the exercise price of the Series H and 2016 Subordination Warrants are such that the exercise of 80 warrants with an aggregate exercise price of $166.40 will result in the issuance of one share of common stock. 
 The Company has agreed to make amortization payments with respect to the 2016 Notes in fifteen (15) equal installments beginning January 30, 2017. On each installment date, assuming certain equity conditions are met, the installment payment shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate defined in the agreement.   
 Under the terms of the 2016 Notes, at closing the Company received an initial tranche of $6.0 million for immediate use for general corporate purposes. The remaining cash proceeds of $62 million are being held in restricted accounts and will be released to the Company from the restricted accounts in subsequent equal tranches subject to certain equity conditions.  As of September 30, 2016, the remaining cash in the amount of $62.0 million is still being held in restricted accounts and will be released to the Company subject to certain equity conditions and the terms of the 2016 Notes.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the 2016 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at $160 per share.  The Company has a conversion right related to the required installment payments where the Company can convert the installments payments (subject to a floor of $1.00) at: (a) the prevailing holder conversion price; (b) 80% of the arithmetic average of the 3 lowest volume weighted average price (VWAP) days in the prior 20 days; and (c) the weighted average value of the common stock on the trading day preceding the installment payment date.  Both the conversion right of the holder and the Company is subject to a reset clause if the Company issues or sells common stock at a lower price than the applicable conversion rate at such time (not subject to the $1.00 floor).  At September 30, 2016, the most advantageous conversion term is a conversion price of $1.87 which would convert the note into 40,154,192 shares of common stock.   
 The Company determined the conversion feature in the Notes represents an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation due to the ratchet provision described above related to the conversion feature. The provisions in the Series H and 2016 Subordination Warrants also require the Company to account for the warrants as derivative liabilities. The original issue discount, the fair value of the embedded conversion feature, the fair value of the Series H and 2016 Subordination Warrants and the debt issuance costs are all together considered the debt discount. The Company recorded a debt discount in the amount of $75.0 million which is being amortized over the life of the note using the effective interest method. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, $15,532,228 of the debt discount had been amortized to interest expense.  
 The following table summarizes the 2016 Notes outstanding at September 30, 2016:    

The fair values of the derivative embedded conversion feature and derivative Series H warrants (including the 2016 Subordination Warrants) were approximately $80.6 million and $101.6 million, respectively (see NOTE 11 DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES).   The derivative amounts in excess of proceeds received on the 2016 Notes was approximately $119.2 million which was recognized as a day one cost of capital and accordingly charged to interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

There are no outstanding Underwriters  Unit Purchase Options as of September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 11 DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES 
 Financial instruments such as warrants and embedded conversion options deemed to be derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value at inception and subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date as long as such instruments are classified as derivative liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability was included as a component of Other income (expense) and has no effect on the Company s cash flows. The valuation methodologies used vary by instrument and include a Black-Scholes option valuation model utilizing the fair value of the underlying common stock and a modified binomial model. The Company has determined the fair value measurements to be a level 3 measurement (see NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES). 
 16 

Class A Warrants, Class B Warrants, Series B Warrants and Certain Common Warrants  
 The Class A Warrants, Class B Warrants and certain common warrants, have an exercise price adjustment provision that in the event the Company sells shares of any additional stock, subject to certain exceptions, at a price per share less than the current exercise price of the respective warrant, the exercise price shall be adjusted to a price equal to the price paid per share for such additional stock. The Series B Warrants have an exercise price adjustment provision that in the event the Company sells shares of any additional stock, subject to certain exceptions, at a price per share less than the then current market price, the exercise price shall be adjusted to a price based on a formula defined in the warrants agreement. Such exercise price adjustments prohibit the Company from being able to conclude that the warrants are indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly, these warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value at each reporting date with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of conversions on the 2015 Note, the price adjustment provision was triggered for our Class A Warrants, Class B Warrants, Series B Warrants and certain common warrants and the exercise price per share was adjusted accordingly. 
 The fair value of these warrants was calculated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model utilizing the fair value of underlying common stock. Black-Scholes has inherent limitations for use in the case of a warrant with a price protection provision, since the model is designed to be used when the inputs to the model are static throughout the life of a security. Due to the significant variance between the fair market value of the stock and the exercise price, the Black-Scholes option-pricing model resulted in a fair value that approaches the current market value of the stock. As such, the aggregate fair value of the Class A, Class B, Series B and certain other common warrants was estimated to be $231 at September 30, 2016. 
   
 Series C Warrants and Unit Purchase Option 
 The Series C Warrants contained a cashless exercise provision using a predetermined Black Scholes Value. Such provision, if exercised by the holder, would require the Company to settle these warrants, at its option, either by cash payment or the granting of a variable number of common shares. This provision results in the potential for the Company to either have to net cash settle the warrant or potentially issue an indeterminate number of common shares which prohibits the Company from being able to conclude that the warrants are indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly, the warrants and the unit purchase option are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value at each reporting date with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 all of the remaining Series C Warrants and unit purchase options were exercised. 
   
 Convertible Notes Conversion Feature   2015 Note 
 The convertible notes issued in December 2015 contain provisions that protect holders from future issuances of the Company s common stock at prices below such convertible notes  respective conversion price. These provisions could result in modification of the conversion price due to a future equity offering and as such the conversion feature cannot be considered indexed to the Company s own stock. The 2015 Notes also provides that the Company will repay the principal amount at an initial conversion rate subject to certain adjustments. These features represent an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation and are recorded at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period.  
 As discussed in NOTE 6 CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE, a portion of the 2015 Note was converted during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which resulted in an extinguishment of the derivative liability (included in loss on extinguishment of debt) of approximately $4.8 million. In order to appropriately calculate the extinguishment expense, the derivative liability was marked to fair value at each extinguishment date during the period. The fair value of the derivative was calculated at the various extinguishment dates using a modified binomial model to reflect different scenarios where reset may be triggered using the following range of assumptions: 

(1)  
 
 The conversion price was calculated based on the formula in the 2015 Notes agreement as of the respective measurement dates.  

(2)  
 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the average of the 6 month and 1-year Treasury Bill as of the respective measurement date.  

17 

(3)   
 
 The volatility factor was estimated by using the historical volatilities of the Company s trading history.  

(4)  
 
 Management determined the dividend yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  

The Company determined the fair value of the remaining conversion feature to be $2,706,796 at September 30, 2016 using a modified binomial model to reflect different scenarios where reset may be triggered using the following assumptions: 

(1)  
 
 The conversion price was calculated based on the formula in the 2015 Notes agreement as of the respective measurement date  

(2)

Series D Warrants and 2015 Subordination Warrants 
 In connection with the issuance of convertible notes in December 2015, the Company issued Series D Warrants to acquire 1,252 shares of common stock. In addition, the Company issued 2015 Subordination Warrants to acquire 38 shares of common stock. The Series D Warrants and 2015 Subordination Warrants contain provisions that will adjust the exercise price upon certain equity issuances.  In addition, these warrants contain a provision for a one-time adjustment at December 31, 2016, to the number of warrants issued such that the number of warrants will increase to equal 16.6% of the outstanding shares and common stock equivalents at such time (0.5% for the 2015 Subordination Warrants). The Company has determined that the provisions contained in the Series D Warrants and the 2015 Subordination Warrants could result in modification of the exercise price due to a future equity offering resulting in a variable number of additional common shares that could be issued. This prohibits the Company from being able to conclude that the warrants are indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly, the warrants represent a derivative liability that requires recording at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period.  
 The Company determined the fair value of the Series D Warrants and 2015 Subordination Warrants to be $22,590,296 at September 30, 2016 using a binomial model with a Monte Carlo simulation to reflect different scenarios where reset may be triggered and to project the range of the additional shares to be issued on December 31, 2016 using the following assumptions: 

(1)  
 
 The exercise price of the Series D and Subordination Warrants was calculated based on the terms in the warrant agreement.  

(2)  
 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the 5-year Treasury Bill as of the respective measurement date.  

(3)  
 
 The volatility factor was estimated by using the historical volatilities of the Company s trading history.  

(4)  
 
 Management determined the dividend yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  

Series E Warrants 
 In connection with the February 2016 Unit Offering, the Company issued Series E Warrants to purchase 21,000 shares of common stock as part of the units sold in the offering (see NOTE 9 COMMON STOCK). The Series E Warrants contain a provision  that for one year from issuance  the exercise price per share will adjust if the Company has certain equity issuances for consideration per share  
 18 

that is less than the current exercise price of the Series E Warrants.   In addition, these warrants contain a provision for a   one-time adjustment   one year from date of issuance  , to the number of warrants issued  .     The Company has determined that the provisions contained in the Series E Warrants could result in modification of the exercise price due to a future equity offering resul  ting in a variable number of additional common shares that could be issued. This prohibits the company from being able to conclude that the warrants are indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly, the warrants represent a derivative liability that req  uires recording at fair value at issuance and again at each reporting period with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period.   
 On April 7, 2016, the Company entered into certain warrant exchange agreements (the  Exchange Agreements ), each by and between the Company and a holder of its outstanding Series E Warrants, pursuant to which the Company and each such holder agreed to exchange outstanding Series E Warrants for shares of common stock of the Company. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, the Company issued 8,127 shares of common stock of the Company in exchange for the surrender by the holders to the Company of 58,800,000 Series E Warrants exercisable to acquire approximately 21,000 shares of common stock of the Company (representing an exchange ratio of one share of common stock for each 2.584 shares of common stock underlying the surrendered Series E Warrants). The surrendered Series E Warrants were immediately cancelled by the Company and there are not any Series E Warrants issued and outstanding (see NOTE 9 COMMON STOCK). 
 The Company determined the fair value of the Series E Warrants to be   $6,800,927 at April 7, 2016 using a binomial model with a Monte Carlo simulation model using the following assumptions: 

(1)  
 
 The exercise price of the Series E Warrants was calculated based on the terms in the warrant agreement.  

(2)  
 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using an average of the 5-year and 7-year Treasury Bill as of the respective measurement date.  

(3)  
 
 The volatility factor was estimated by using the historical volatilities of the Company s trading history.  

(4)  
 
 Management determined the dividend yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  

Since the Series E Warrants were derivative liabilities at the time of the transaction, the Company has accounted for the exchange  as an extinguishment of a liability.   Accordingly, all consideration issued to extinguish the liability was recorded at fair value on the date of the extinguishment and the liability extinguished was removed at its carrying value. Since the liabilities extinguished were derivative liabilities, their carrying value is continuously adjusted to equal their fair value.  The difference between the fair value of the liability extinguished and the fair value of the consideration provided on April 7, 2016 was recorded as a gain in the statement of operations  as follows:  

Series G Warrants 
 In connection with the June 2016 Unit Offering, the Company issued Series G Warrants to purchase 39,500 shares of common stock as part of the units sold in the offering (see NOTE 9 COMMON STOCK). The Series G Warrants contain a provision  that  the exercise price per share will adjust if the Company has certain equity issuances for consideration per share that is less than the current exercise price of the Series G Warrants.  The Company has determined that the provisions contained in the Series G Warrants could result in modification of the exercise price due to a future equity offering resulting in a variable number of additional common shares that could be issued. This prohibits the Company from being able to conclude that the warrants are indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly, the warrants represent a derivative liability that requires recording at fair value at issuance and again at each reporting period with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period.   
 19 

On July 11, 2016, 85,000 Series G Warrants were exercised for cash in the amount of $113,900.  These warrants need to recor  ded at fair value at the transaction date with any change in the fair value from the previous period being recorded in earnings for the period.  This revaluing is necessary as derivatives are required to be subsequently measured at fair value under ASC 815  .  
 The Company determined the fair value of the 85,000 of the Series G Warrants exercised to be $118,424 at the transaction date of July 11, 2016 resulting in a gain in the statement of operations in the amount of $30,547. 
 The fair value of the Series G Warrants was calculation using a Black Scholes model with the following inputs: 

(1)  
 
 The exercise price of the Series G Warrants was calculated based on the terms in the warrant agreement.  

(2)  
 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the average of the 5-year Treasury Bill as of the respective measurement date.  

(3)  
 
 The volatility factor was estimated by using the historical volatilities of the Company s trading history.  

(4)  
 
 Management determined the dividend yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  

The Company determined the fair value of the remaining 3,075,000 Series G Warrants to be $86,844 on September 30, 2016 using a Black Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: 

(2)  
 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the 5-year Treasury Bill as of the respective measurement date.  

(3)  
 
 The volatility factor was estimated by using the historical volatilities of the Company s trading history.  

(4)  
 
 Management determined the dividend yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  

Convertible Notes Conversion Feature   2016 Notes 
 The 2016 Notes contain provisions that protect holders from future issuances of the Company s common stock at prices below such convertible notes  respective conversion price. These provisions could result in modification of the conversion price due to a future equity offering and as such the conversion feature cannot be considered indexed to the Company s own stock. The 2016 Notes also provide that the Company will repay the principal amount at an initial conversion rate subject to certain adjustments. These features represent an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation and are recorded at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period.  
 20 

The Company determined the fair value of the conversion   feature to be $80,599,528 and $78,549,907 at inception (July 1, 2016) and September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company determined fair value using a modified binomial model to reflect different scenarios where reset may be triggered using the following a  ssumptions:  

(1)  
 
 The conversion price was calculated based on the formula in the 2016 Notes agreement as of the respective measurement date  

(2)  
 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the average of the 1-year and 2-year Treasury Bill as of the respective measurement date.  

(3)  
 
 The volatility factor was estimated by using the historical volatilities of the Company s trading history.  

Series H Warrants and 2016 Subordination Warrants 
 In connection with the issuance of the 2016 Notes, the Company issued Series H Warrants to acquire 703,125 shares of common stock and 2016 Subordination Warrants to acquire 21,094 shares of common stock. The Series H Warrants and 2016 Subordination Warrants contain provisions that will adjust the exercise price upon certain equity issuances.  The Company has determined that the provisions contained in the Series H Warrants and the 2016 Subordination Warrants could result in modification of the exercise price due to future equity offerings resulting in a variable number of additional common shares that could be issued. This prohibits the company from being able to conclude that the warrants are indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly, the warrants represent a derivative liability that requires recording at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value being recorded in earnings for the period.  
 The Company determined the fair value of the Series H Warrants and 2016 Subordination Warrants to be $101,644,520 and $1,637,959 at inception (July 1, 2016) and September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company determined the fair value using a modified binomial model to reflect different scenarios where reset may be triggered using the following assumptions: 

(1)  
 
 The exercise price of the Series H and Subordination Warrants was calculated based on the terms in the warrant agreement.  

(2)  
 
 The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the 5-year Treasury Bill as of the respective measurement date.  

(3)  
 
 The volatility factor was estimated by using the historical volatilities of the Company s trading history.  

(4)  
 
 Management determined the dividend yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  

The Company classifies assets and liabilities measured at fair value in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.  No financial assets were measured on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The following tables set forth the financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within their fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2106 and December 31, 2015:

NOTE 13 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 On April 5, 2016 and May 31, 2016, Great Basin Scientific, Inc., received notices from the Utah Labor Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Division (ULC) and/or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) that former employee Christina Steele filed a claim alleging retaliation in violation of the Utah Occupational Safety and Health Act as well as the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, among other claims relating to her employment.  Ms. Steele alleges that the Company retaliated against her by terminating her employment after she allegedly acted as a whistleblower by allegedly raising concerns with management.  Ms. Steele seeks lost wages, future wages, consequential losses, emotional distress damages, interest, fees and costs.   
 On June 15, 2016, Ms. Steele also filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Utah alleging retaliation in violation of the False Claims Act based on similar alleged facts. Ms. Steele seeks back pay, special damages, consequential damages, compensatory damages, interest, fees and costs.  On August 15, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Ms. Steele s claims.    
 The Company asserts that the claims are without merit and that the employee resigned and was not terminated. 
 We are not currently a party to any other material pending legal proceeding or regulatory or government investigations. We may become involved in litigation from time to time relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of the investigation by the ULC or OSHA, the claim filed in the United States District Court or other claims in the ordinary course of business would have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  

NOTE 14 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
 On October 2, 2016, the Company entered into separate exchange agreements with each of the Buyers of the 2015 Notes, pursuant to which an alternate conversion price would be used during the period from October 3, 2016 through November 17, 2016 equal to 85% of the lowest daily weighted average price of our common stock during the five (5) consecutive trading days ending and including the date of conversion. If any of the 2015 Notes remain outstanding on November 18, 2016 (the  Exchange Date ), on the Exchange Date all such remaining 2105 Notes shall be exchanged into shares of our common at an exchange price equal to 85% of the lowest daily weighted average price of our common stock during the five (5) consecutive trading days ending and including the trading day immediately prior to the Exchange Date.  The Buyers released all restrictions on the Company s use of approximately $3.5 million of proceeds of the offering of Notes and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, on November 1, 2016 the Buyers will release all restrictions on the Company s use of the remaining approximately $3.6 million of proceeds of the offering of our 2015 Notes.  
 In October 2016, certain holders of the 2015 Notes submitted notices to accelerate previously deferred amortization payments under the 2015 Notes and convert the accelerated payments on the 2015 Notes into shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Conversions ).  In connection with the Conversions, the Company issued 92,546,489 shares of common stock upon the conversion of $5,714,805 principal amount of 2015 Notes at a conversion price between $0.28 and $0.02 per share. 
 On October 24, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Utah heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss Ms. Steele s claims filed by the Company on August 15, 2016.  The Court has not yet issued a ruling. 
 On November 2, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation for Series E Preferred Stock to the Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Designation reduced, pursuant to Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the number of authorized Series E Preferred Shares from 2,860,200 Series E Preferred Shares to 74,380 Series E Preferred Shares, the number of Series E Preferred Shares issued and outstanding as of November 2, 2016. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the 2,785,820 authorized Series E Preferred Shares eliminated pursuant to the reduction return to the available undesignated preferred stock of the Company and may be re-designated into another series of preferred stock. 
 On November 2, 2016, the Company separately amended and restated the October 2, 2016 Exchange Agreements with each of the Buyers, pursuant to which on November 3, 2016 the Company exchanged all of the remaining 2015 Notes outstanding, approximately $8.4 million in aggregate principal amount thereof, for 8,436 shares of a new class of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. In addition, on November 3, 2016, the Company mandatorily converted 2,098 of the Preferred Shares into approximately 104.9 million shares of our common stock, at a conversion price of $0.02 per share. (or, if necessary to comply with the restrictions on beneficial ownership set forth in the Amended Exchange Agreement, with any shares of our common stock in excess of the beneficial ownership restriction held in abeyance until permitted to be received by such holder of Preferred Shares.  The Company  
 23 

reserved approximately 104.9 million shares of our common stock for issuance purs  uant to the Certificate of Designations.   Due to restrictions on beneficial ownership the Company converted 1,152 shares of Series F Preferred Stock into 57,600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the mandatory conversion.  The remaining 946 shares of Se  ries F Preferred stock are held in abeyance and remain to be mandatorily converted for the issuance of 47,300,000 shares of common stock. In conjunction with the amendment, e  ach Buyer waived certain existing requirements by the Company to reserve shares of   our common stock with respect to the other securities of the Company held by such Buyer including but not limited to waiver of share reserve requirements pursuant to the Company s 2016 Notes and Series H Warrants.  Concurrent with the closing of the excha  nge, all restrictions on $3.6 million in cash held in restricted accounts of the Company were released which became available for use by the Company to fund its operations.  After giving effect to such Exchange, all rights and obligations under the   2015   Notes were cancelled and   there is no longer a first priority perfected security interest in the assets of the Company securing the 2015 Notes.   
 On November 3, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation to its Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, creating Series F Preferred Stock of the Company. Each share of Series F Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000 and a par value of $0.001 per share and shall be entitled to dividends, on an as converted basis, with the holders of our common stock, but will not accrue additional dividends unless a Triggering Event has occurred and is continuing, in which case dividends will accrue at a default rate of 10% per annum.  The holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall have the right to vote with holders of shares of our common stock, voting together as one class on all matters, with each Preferred Share entitling the holder thereof to cast that number of votes per share as is equal to the aggregate number of shares of our common stock on an as converted basis, provided, that no holder (together with such holder s attribution parties) shall be permitted to have a number of votes in excess of such aggregate number of votes granted to the holders of 9.99% of the shares our common stock then outstanding (including any votes with respect to any shares of our common stock and preferred stock beneficially owned by the holder or such holder s attribution parties). The Series F Preferred Stock will be initially convertible at the election of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.02, subject to adjustments.   
 On November 3, 2016, in connection with the issuance of the Series F Preferred Stock, the exercise and conversion prices of certain outstanding securities were automatically adjusted to take into account the conversion price of the Series F Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the exercise price for our Series D, 2015 Subordination, Series H and 2106 Subordination Warrants were adjusted to $0.02 per share of common stock.  The exercise price of our Series B Warrants was adjusted to $91,975 per share of common stock.  The conversion price of our 2016 Notes was adjusted to $1.00 per share of common stock.

risks related to the Company s outstanding convertible notes issued in July of 2016 (the  2016 Notes ) and the Company s Series F Preferred Stock;     

risks associated with our being a penny stock; and     

risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers and other organizations that provide goods and services to us.      

 These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-Q,  Part II. Item 1A.   Risk Factors ,  Item 1A.   Risk Factors  of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Commission on March 1, 2016, and  Risk Factors  in our registration statement on Form S-1, as filed with the Commission on August 15, 2016, may include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements.

 You should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference and have filed as exhibits with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.  
 Overview of Our Business  
 We are a molecular diagnostic testing company. We are focused on improving patient care through the development and commercialization of our patented, low-cost, molecular diagnostic platform for testing for infectious disease, especially hospital acquired infections. We believe our platform has the ability to transform molecular testing for infectious diseases at small to medium sized hospitals by providing an affordable solution that meets the rapidly evolving needs of patients and providers.  
 We believe there is a fast-growing market for molecular diagnostic systems being purchased by hospital microbiology labs to replace culture and other legacy testing formats. We believe our platform is well positioned to meet this need. Our platform provides results in 45 to 115 minutes depending on the test. Molecular testing generally reduces test time from days to hours, and provides more accurate results, which we believe leads to shortened hospital stays and improved patient outcomes, all of which leads to reduced cost for hospitals that implement molecular testing in their labs. 
 Our platform is an automated molecular diagnostic system, consisting of an analyzer and associated assay cartridge. Our platform utilizes a sample-to-result format, which means that once a patient specimen is received, it undergoes limited processing before it is placed in the analyzer where the assay is run without further technician intervention. This reduces assay complexity and eliminates the need for highly trained and expensive molecular technicians to run the tests. Our platform is designed to enable simple, rapid and cost-effective analysis of multiple pathogens from a single clinical sample, which will allow small to medium sized community hospitals that traditionally could not afford more expensive or complex molecular diagnostic testing platforms to modernize their laboratory testing and provide better patient care at an affordable cost. 
 In November 2012, we launched our first FDA-cleared test for  C. diff,  a bacteria that causes life-threatening gastrointestinal distress in hospital patients. We currently sell our diagnostic test cartridge in the United States through a direct sales force and we use distributors in the European Union and New Zealand. As of September 30, 2016, we had 255 customers worldwide (234 in the United States and 21 in the rest of the world), who use an aggregate of 510 of our analyzers. Our easy to use platform allows small to medium sized hospitals that we believe could not previously afford more expensive or complex molecular diagnostic systems to modernize their laboratory testing and provide better patient care at an affordable cost. 
 In addition to our  C. diff  assay, we have developed three additional tests, Group B Strep assay for which we received FDA clearance in April 2015 and launched commercially in June 2015, Shiga toxin producing  E. coli   assay , or STEC, for which we received FDA clearance in March 2016 and launched commercially in August 2016, and Staph ID/R assay for which we received FDA clearance in March of 2016 and commercially launched on September 30, 2016.  Additionally, we have five other assays in various stages of product development: (i) a pre-surgical nasal screen for  Staphylococcus aureus , or SA, (ii) a food borne pathogen panel, (iii) a panel for candida blood infections (iv) a test for pertussis and, (v) a test for CT/NG.

Since inception, we have incurred net losses from operations each year and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our losses attributable to operation  s for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $57.9 million and $82.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $204.4 million.  
 Our Strategy  
 Our goal is to become the leading provider of sample-to-result, multiplex and low-plex molecular diagnostic testing in infectious disease by leveraging the strengths of our affordable diagnostic testing platform. We intend to expand the use of our platform by targeting small to medium sized hospitals in the United States with fewer than 400 beds. We believe that our low-cost platform will be attractive to these hospitals in particular, which may not otherwise have sufficient resources to justify the purchase of a molecular diagnostic sample-to-result solution. To achieve this objective, we intend to do the following:  

Leverage our Low-Cost Platform to Quickly Penetrate the Small and Medium Sized Hospital Market  .    We provide our customers with our analyzer at no cost and sell them the disposable, single-use diagnostic cartridges. This allows us to avoid the long sales cycle inherent in selling capital equipment and expand into hospitals that previously could not afford to implement a molecular diagnostic platform.      

Accelerate the Growth of our U.S. Customer Base  .    We intend to expand our sales force to target small to medium hospitals in the United States. We anticipate that increasing our number of customers will drive sales of our diagnostic cartridges. We expect these sales will generate the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future.      

Expand our Menu of Molecular Diagnostic Assays  .      We intend to expand our assay menu to include additional assays for our platform that we believe will satisfy growing medical needs and present attractive commercial opportunities. For example, in 2014 we completed the clinical trials and filed the 510(k) application for our second test for Group B Strep, and in April 2015 we received FDA clearance for our Group B Strep test. In March 2016 we also received clearance for Staph ID/R and for Shiga toxin producing   E. coli  . We also have a pipeline of assays in late stage product development, including pre-surgical screening, food-borne pathogens, candida, pertussis and CT/NG.        

Reduce our Cost of Sales through Automation and Volume Purchasing.      We manufacture our proprietary diagnostic cartridges and analyzers at our manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. We currently hand-build our diagnostic cartridges and purchase materials at higher per unit cost due to low purchase volumes. We believe that investment in automation of portions of the manufacturing and assembly process and volume purchase pricing will significantly improve our gross margins and enhance our ability to provide a low-cost solution to customers.      

 Recent Corporate Developments 

On July 1, 2016, we closed  a $75 million senior secured convertible note financing pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated June 29, 2016 (the  SPA ) between the Company and certain buyers as set forth in the Schedule of Buyers attached to the SPA, as previously described in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the Commission on June 29, 2016.

 Concurrent with the closing of the exchange, all restrictions on $3.6 million in cash held in restricted accounts of the Company will be released, which will then be available for use by the Company to fund its operations.    

On November 2, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Designation for Series E Preferred Stock to the Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Designation reduced, pursuant to Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the number of authorized Series E Preferred Shares from 2,860,200 Series E Preferred Shares to 74,380 Series E Preferred Shares, the number of Series E Preferred Shares issued and outstanding as of November 2, 2016. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the 2,785,820 authorized Series E Preferred Shares eliminated pursuant to the reduction return to the available undesignated preferred stock of the Company and may be re-designated into another series of preferred stock.

 Results of Operations  
 The following presents an overview of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 29 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months e  nded September 30, 2015   
 Revenue     

Revenue increased 35% for three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Revenue derived from the sale of STEC assays began since the product was commercially launched in August 2016.  There was no revenue from the sale of SIDR assays during the third quarter, as the product did not launch until the last day of September 2016, but SIDR revenue is expected during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The 35% increase in total sales was attributable to the number of customers increasing to 255 by September 30, 2016, as compared to 143 at the end of September 30, 2015.  In addition, the number of analyzers placed with customers rose to 510 at September 30, 2016, as compared to 336 at the end of September of the prior year.  During 2016, the Company was intensely focused on building its customer base and placing additional analyzers in the field.  While the increase in customers and analyzers was not always directly proportional to the increase in the Company s traditional C. diff sales, the Company anticipates selling higher quantities of existing assays, as well as new assays to this larger customer group once new products come to market.  
 Cost of sales    

The overall cost of direct labor for the third quarter of 2016 increased as a percentage of revenue as compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to the hiring of production workers for additional daily shifts due to both an increase in production of existing assays, and in anticipation of production of our new STEC and Staph ID/R assays.  These two assays were launched in August and September of 2016.  Similarly, indirect labor and overhead increased as a percentage of revenue due to anticipated demand for new assays, along with underutilization of capacity in our analyzer manufacturing group.  During periods when analyzers are being manufactured, the group s labor and overhead costs are allocated to the cost of the analyzers produced and expensed eventually through depreciation.  Otherwise, the group s costs are expensed directly to cost of sales during the period incurred.  Depreciation of analyzers also increased since the number of analyzers placed in the field grew from 336 at September 30, 2015, to 510 at September 30, 2016. 
 Operating Expenses  

Research and Development  
 Research and development expenses increased 30% during the three months ended September 30, 2016, due to an increase of $187,126 for hiring new developers and scientists, an increase of $589,768 for additional costs for clinical trials, experimental assays,  
 30 

and outside consultants, all related to the development of new products, and a net increase of all other research and development expenses aggregati  ng $82,205.  
 Selling and Marketing  
 The third-quarter 2016 increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to $160,091 in higher salaries and travel costs resulting from an increase in sales and marketing personnel, stemming from the increase in efforts to add customers and sell additional existing and newly-developed assays.  These higher costs included increased commissions related to the increase in new customers, and were also the result of efforts to place additional analyzers in the field.  Also included in the increase was $36,028 in other expenses, offset by a $33,184 decrease in promotional assay costs as two new products were finally launched to customers. 
 General and Administrative  
 The increase in general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of 2016 resulted from increased rent expense of $111,696, as well as $676,582 in increased legal and consulting fees incurred during 2016 because of increased financing activities.  In addition, there were $50,411 in other general and administrative expenses, which were offset by a $170,296 decrease in compensation and travel expenses over the prior year related to certain one-time expenses incurred during 2015. 
 Interest Expense  
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $138.0 million, from $253,220 to $138.2 million, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due mainly to the $119.2 million loss on the issuance of the 2016 convertible note, $18.5 million in debt discount amortizations on our convertible notes, which we didn t have during the third quarter of 2015 and $244,900 increase in all other interest. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability   
 The change in the fair value of the derivative liability resulted in a gain in earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $135.7 million, as compared to a gain in earnings of $20.0 million for the three months September 30, 2015.  This resulted in an increase in the gain recorded in earnings by $115.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. During 2016 s third quarter we had a decrease   in the fair value of our conversion feature and warrants associated with the 2016 Notes in the amount of $102.1 million, a decrease in the fair value of our conversion feature and warrants associated with the 2015 Notes in the amount of $28.3 million, and a decrease in the fair value of all other derivative securities in the amount of $5.3 million.  These decreases were all a result of the decrease in the value of our common stock during the third quarter. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the fair value of all the derivative securities decreased by $20.0 million, also due to the decrease in the value of our common stock during the period.  
 Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015  
 Revenue     

Revenue increased 44% for nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Revenue derived from the sale of STEC assays began since the product was commercially launched in August 2016.  There was no revenue from the sale of SIDR assays during the third quarter, as the product did not launch until the last day of September 2016, but SIDR revenue is expected during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The 44% increase in total sales was attributable to the number of customers increasing to 255 by September 30, 2016, as compared to 143 at the end of September 30, 2015.  In addition, the number of analyzers placed with customers rose to 510 at September 30, 2016, as compared to 336 at the end of September of the prior year.  During 2016, the Company was intensely focused on building its customer base and placing additional analyzers in the field.  While the increase in customers and analyzers was not always directly proportional to the increase in the Company s traditional C. diff sales,  
 31 

the Company anticipates selling higher quantities of existing assays, as well as new assays to this larger customer group once new products come to market.  
 Cost of Sales 

The overall cost of direct labor increased as a percentage of revenue due to the hiring of production workers during the third quarter of 2016 for additional daily shifts in anticipation of increased production of STEC and Staph ID/R assays.  These two assays were launched in August and September of 2016.  Similarly, indirect labor and overhead increased as a percentage of revenue due to anticipated demand for new assays, along with underutilization of capacity in our analyzer manufacturing group.  During periods when analyzers are being manufactured, the group s labor and overhead costs are allocated to the cost of the analyzers produced and expensed eventually through depreciation.  Otherwise, the group s costs are expensed directly to cost of sales during the period incurred.  Depreciation of analyzers also increased since the number of analyzers placed in the field grew from 336 at September 30, 2015, to 510 at September 30, 2016.  
 Operating Expenses  

Research and Development  
 Research and development expenses increased 51% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period during the prior year, due to an increase of $899,860 for hiring new developers, scientists, and recruiting costs, an increase of $1.9 million for additional costs for clinical trials, experimental assays, and outside consultants, all related to the development of new products, and a net increase of all other research and development expenses aggregating $382,539. 
 Selling and Marketing  
 The 2016 increase in sales and marketing expenses as compared to 2015 was due to primarily to $1.4 million in higher salaries, travel, and promotional assay costs resulting from an increase in sales and marketing personnel and their increased efforts to add customers and sell additional existing and newly-developed assays.  These higher expenses included increased commissions related to the increase in new customers, and were also the result of efforts to place additional analyzers in the field. All other expenses increased $311,764. 
 General and Administrative  
 The increase in general and administrative expenses for the first three quarters of 2016 compared to 2015 resulted from an increase of $502,632 related to the hiring of additional accounting and human resource personnel, as well as $232,351 in increased rent expense, all to accommodate growth experienced during 2016 and growth anticipated in the future.  In addition, there was $1.7 million in increased legal and consulting fees incurred during 2016 because of increased financing activities.  There was also a $201,883 in additional corporate registration and property tax expenses, and $441,022 in all other general and administrative expenses. 
 32 

Interest Expense   
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $149.8 million, from $868,587 to $150.7 million, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due mainly to the $119.2 million loss on the issuance of the 2016 convertible note, $30.4 million in debt discount amortizations on our convertible notes, which we didn t have during the prior year and $212,415 increase in all other interest. 
 Net Gain on Exchange and Issuance of Warrants   
 The exchange and issuance of warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in a net gain of $3.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a gain on the exchange of Series E Warrants in the amount of $4.1 million.  This gain was partially offset by a loss on the issuance of our Series G Warrants in the amount of $0.7 million.  We did not have a warrant exchange and issuance during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability   
 The change in fair value of the derivative liability resulted in a gain in earnings of $106.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to loss in earnings of $22.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a decrease   in the fair value of our conversion feature and warrants associated with the 2016 Notes in the amount of $102.1 million and a decrease in the fair value of all other derivative securities in the amount of $4.8 million.  These decreases were the result of the decrease in the value of our common stock during the period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we were required to record a charge in the amount of $55.6 million to record the derivative liability on the issuance date of our Series C warrants offered as part of the follow-on offering. This charge was partially offset by an amount of $33.0 million due to the decrease in the fair value of all derivative securities as a result of the decrease in the value of our common stock during the period.  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 We have funded our operations to date primarily with net proceeds from our IPO, our follow-on public offerings, cash exercises of warrants, sales of our preferred stock, convertible notes, and revenues from operations.  At September 30, 2016, we had unrestricted cash of $809,763, and restricted cash of $69.1 million.  The restricted cash is related to convertible notes we entered into in December 2015 and July 2016, and the restrictions on the use of the cash will be released during the rest of 2016 and 2017 as certain equity conditions are met. The cash will be used to finance the continued growth in product sales, to invest in further product development, and to meet ongoing corporate needs.  
 In February 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering, whereby 39,200,000 units were sold at a price of $0.16 per unit for net proceeds of $5.0 million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering costs.  Each group of 2,800 units converted into one share of our common stock, along with 4,200 Series E Warrants to purchase one share of common stock. 
 In June 2016, we completed another follow-on public offering, whereby 3,160,000 units were sold at a price of $1.90 per unit for net proceeds of $5.3 million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering costs.  Each group of 80 units converted into one share of our common stock, along with 80 Series G Warrants to purchase one share of common stock. 
 In July 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement to issue $75 million of original issue discount convertible notes and related Series H Warrants and Subordination Warrants to purchase common stock.  We received $68 million in total proceeds, of which $62 million was placed in restricted accounts.  Currently, the notes are convertible into 75,000,000 shares of common stock, the Series H Warrants are convertible into 703,125 shares of common stock, and the Subordination Warrants are convertible into 21,094 shares of common stock. 
 We have limited liquidity and have not yet established a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs, based on our current estimated burn rate.  Accordingly, as discussed herein, our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate greater revenue through increased sales and/or our ability to raise additional funds through the capital markets.

Summary Statement of Cash Flows for the Nin  e Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $24.1 million. The net loss of $82.5 million was offset by non-cash items of $30.4 million for the convertible note debt discount amortization, $119.2 million for the loss on the issuance of convertible note, $17.2 million for the loss on the extinguishment of debt, $1.9 million for the increase in depreciation and amortization, and $196,315 in all other non-cash items.  These non-cash increases were partially offset by $106.9 million change in the fair value of the derivative liability, and $3.4 million for a non-cash net gain on the exchange and issuance of warrants. The change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a further use of cash of $288,648, primarily due to a rise in inventory and accounts receivable amounts attributable to the launch of new products and sales increases, offset partially by a related net rise in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and vendor prepayments. 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $14.8 million. The net loss of $39.0 million was offset by other non-cash items of $22.6 million for the increase in fair value of derivative liability, $1.1 million for the increase in depreciation and amortization, and a $179,213 net increase in all other non-cash items. The change in operating assets and liabilities further offset the net loss by another $157,424 due to a $552,275 increase in accrued liabilities due mainly to payroll, and a $457,250 increase in accounts payable related to the growth in our operations and the timing of payments.  These were partially offset by an increase of $576,872 in inventory, a $197,270 increase in prepaid and other assets, and a $77,959 increase in accounts receivable

 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $23.1 million, comprised of net proceeds of $10.7 million from the sale of units in our follow-on offerings, the release of $6.7 million in funds from our restricted cash accounts, net proceeds of $5.5 million from the issuance of convertible notes payable, and $1.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of underwriter purchase warrants and Series G Warrrants.  These were partially offset by $314,879 for the cash settlement of the exercise of Series C Warrants, and $955,455 in payments made on capital leases and notes payable. 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $24.2 million, comprised of net proceeds of $21.7 million from the sale of units in our follow-on offering, proceeds of $250,000 from related-party notes payable, and $3.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants, partially offset by $954,585 in payments made on capital leases, notes payable, and related-party notes payable. 
 Satisfaction of our cash obligations for the next 12 months and our ability to continue as a going concern  
 Our condensed unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. At September 30, 2016, we had unrestricted and restricted cash amounts of $809,763 and $69.1 million, respectively.  We have incurred substantial losses from operations and negative operating cash flows which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  We sustained a net loss for the  
 34 

nine month  s ended September 30, 2016 of $83.0 million and a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $57.9 million. We have an accumulated deficit of $204.9 million as of September 30, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used for ope  rations was $24.1 million. Whether and when we can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations is uncertain.  
 We intend to continue to develop our products and expand our customer base, but we do not have sufficient realized revenues or operating cash flows in order to finance these activities internally.  As a result, we have obtained and intend to continue to obtain financing in order to fund our working capital and development needs.  In February 2016, we obtained financing by completing a follow-on offering for net proceeds of $5.0 million, and in June 2016, we completed another follow-on offering for net proceeds of $5.3 million. In July 2016, we signed and issued convertible notes for net proceeds of $68 million, of which a net $5.4 million was immediately available while the rest of the proceeds were placed in the Company s restricted accounts. Through September 30, 2016, we have drawn from restricted accounts a total of $6.7 million related to both our July 2016 and December 2015 convertible notes.  However, in order to continue operations we will need to obtain additional financing in addition to the anticipated release of restrictions from funds currently in the Company s restricted accounts under the terms of our convertible notes. We believe the release of restrictions on funds related to the December 2015 Notes in relation to the exchange of the December 2015 Notes for Series F Preferred Stock will allow us to continue operations through mid-December 2016. We anticipate that we will require an additional $7 million in financing by mid-December 2016 to bridge the gap between the funds released upon the exchange of the 2015 Notes, until funds can be released from restricted cash accounts under the terms of the 2016 Notes.  If we don t receive at least $7 million in financing by mid-December of 2016, the Company will not be able to continue operations as currently planned, and will be required to either curtail or cease operations. 
 We have been able to meet our short-term needs through private placements of convertible preferred securities, an initial public offering ( IPO ), follow-on public offerings, convertible debt and the sale and leaseback of analyzers used to report test results. We will continue to seek funding through the issuance of additional equity securities, debt financing, the sale and leaseback of analyzers, or a combination of these items. Any proceeds received from these items could provide the needed funds for continued operations and development programs. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional financing that we need to alleviate doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are able to obtain sufficient additional financing proceeds, we cannot be certain that this additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will likely experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to obtain additional financings, the impact on our operations will be material and adverse.  
 Critical Accounting Policies  
 The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments, including those related to inventories, receivables, recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of our preferred and common stock and related instruments. We use historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will be reflected in our financial statements as they occur. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the footnotes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results. The critical accounting policies addressed below reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  
 As an emerging growth company, we have elected to opt-in to the extended transition period for new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.  
 Revenue Recognition  
 We derive our revenue from the sale of single use assays sold through our dedicated sales force in the United States, and through a network of distributors in the European Union and New Zealand. Revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery of the products has occurred; (3) the selling price of the product is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability of that price is reasonably assured. Change in title to the product and recognition of revenue from sales of assays occurs at the time of shipment.  
 35 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Acc  ounts   
 Accounts receivable are generated from the sale of assays to end users in the United States and to a network of distributors outside the United States. These accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of allowances for doubtful amounts. We routinely review outstanding accounts receivable balances for estimated uncollectible accounts and establish or adjust the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable using the specific identification method and record a reserve for amounts not expected to be fully recovered. Actual balances are not applied against the reserve until substantially all collection efforts have been exhausted. We do not have customer acceptance provisions, but we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective assays.  
 Inventories  
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined according to the average cost method. Manufactured inventory consists of raw material, direct labor and manufacturing overhead cost components. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory and make appropriate adjustments when necessary. We have made adjustments to, and it is reasonably possible that we may be required to make further adjustments to, the carrying value of inventory in future periods.  
 Long-Lived Assets  
 Long-lived tangible assets, including property and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment and rely on a number of factors, including expected future operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. We use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows and comparisons to like-kind assets, as appropriate, of the related asset over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. Measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including cost-based, market and income approaches as considered necessary. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  
 Our long-lived assets include our analyzers used by hospitals in the United States to run the assays they buy from us. There are no contractual terms with respect to the usage of our analyzers by our customers. Hospitals are under no contractual commitment to use our analyzers. We maintain ownership of these analyzers and, when requested, we can remove the analyzers from the customer s site. We do not currently charge for the use of our analyzers and there are no minimum purchase commitments of our assays. As our analyzer is used numerous times over several years, often by many different customers, analyzers are capitalized as property and equipment once they have been placed in service. Once placed in service, analyzers are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on average estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life of our analyzers is determined based on a variety of factors including in reference to associated product life cycles, and average 5 years. As analyzers are integral to the performance of our diagnostic tests, depreciation of analyzers is recognized as a cost of sales.  
 Analyzers used outside the United States are sold to the customer and the sale is accounted for as a sale of fixed assets. Since inception, the Company has not focused nor placed significant emphasis on developing international markets for the Company s product. The Company has never had an international sales force and has never manufactured analyzers specifically for international markets. Over the past two years on occasion, small, international sales opportunities have come along through international distributors. The analyzers that were sold to them were part of the fixed asset pool of analyzers the Company has, and many of these specific analyzers had been previously placed at customer locations within the United States. Sale of the fixed asset analyzers in these limited international opportunities have not been based on established product price listings as no such listing exists or has been publicly marketed to customers; instead, the final sales price has been a negotiated amount based on the sale of a functioning fixed asset analyzer, whether or not that analyzer was previously used at another customer site. Similar to other fixed asset sales, there were no stated or implied warranties or other continuing service requirements made with the sale of these assets. For these limited situations, management has elected to sell the fixed asset analyzers as opposed to placing them with international customers (thereby not retaining title over the analyzers) as it would be impractical for us to retain ownership due to, among other reasons, the Company lacking the necessary personnel needed to service international customers, the need to comply with the additional laws and regulations of countries outside the United States to which the Company is not currently subject, and the added costs to recover, reconfigure, ship and redeploy fixed asset analyzers that have been used internationally. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there were no analyzers sold to international distributors.

Derivative Instruments  
 The Company accounts for derivative instruments under the provisions of ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging . ASC 815 requires the Company to record derivative instruments at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings. As a result of certain terms, conditions and features included in our convertible notes and certain common stock purchase warrants granted by the Company, those securities are required to be accounted for as derivatives at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 
 Income Taxes  
 We are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense or loss based upon tax statutes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. In making these estimates, we adjust our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from these differences are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences in loss and credit carryforwards that will reverse in subsequent years. We also establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances are based, in part, on predictions that management must make as to our results in future periods. The outcome of events could differ over time which would require that we make changes in our valuation allowance.  
 The tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. We examined the tax positions taken in tax returns and determined that there are no uncertain tax positions. As a result, we recorded no uncertain tax liabilities in our balance sheet.  
 Stock Based Compensation  
 We measure and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to our employees and directors, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. Historically, for all periods prior to our IPO, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of our common stock prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the Statements of Standards for Valuation Services No. 1 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Since our IPO, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. 
 We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The fair value is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award on a straight-line basis.  
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We qualify as an  emerging growth company  as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act ) as we do not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2015, being the last day of our prior fiscal year.  
 We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement. 
 As an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the Act. The election is irrevocable. 
 37 

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange   Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:  

Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company s auditor to attest to, and report on, management's assessment of its internal controls.     

Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.     

 As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

ITE  M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
 As a smaller reporting company, we have elected not to provide the disclosures required by this item.  
     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

(a)   
 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      

 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). T he term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 Based on this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.  
 Material Weakness  
 As stated in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified material weaknesses in our system of internal control over financial reporting relating to processes and controls over properly identifying and accounting for transactions of a complex or non-routine nature. Management also identified certain design deficiencies relating to segregation of duties, review and approval, and verification procedures, primarily resulting from the limited number of our accounting staff available to perform such procedures. Additionally, management identified certain design deficiencies to access over information systems.  
 We continue to take steps to remediate the underlying causes of the material weaknesses. As of September 30, 2016, we are in the process of implementing and improving our controls and procedures. We have hired additional accounting and IT personnel to help improve our segregation of duties.  In January 2016, we engaged a third-party consultant to assist us in making further improvements to our existing internal controls over financial reporting, and are continuing the process of formalizing, documenting and implementing written policies and procedures for the review of our various financial reporting processes. We also continue to engage third-party consultants to provide support and to assist us with our evaluation of complex technical accounting matters. We believe these additional resources will enable us to broaden the scope and quality of our controls relating to the oversight and review of financial statements and our application of relevant accounting policies. Furthermore, we continue to implement and improve systems to automate certain financial reporting processes and to improve information accuracy. However, these remediation efforts are still in  
 38 

process and have not yet been fully completed. Because of this material weakness, there is heightened risk that a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  

(b)   
 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     

 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, other than those described above.

PA  RT II. OTHER INFORMATION   
     ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On April 5, 2016 and May 31, 2016, Great Basin Scientific, Inc., received notices from the Utah Labor Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Division (ULC) and/or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) that former employee Christina Steele filed a claim alleging retaliation in violation of the Utah Occupational Safety and Health Act as well as the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, among other claims relating to her employment.  Ms. Steele alleges that Great Basin retaliated against her by terminating her employment after she allegedly acted as a whistleblower by allegedly raising concerns with management.  Ms. Steele seeks lost wages, future wages, consequential losses, emotional distress damages, interest, fees and costs.   
 On June 15, 2016, Ms. Steele also filed a complaint against Great Basin Scientific, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Utah alleging retaliation in violation of the False Claims Act based on similar alleged facts. Ms. Steele seeks back pay, special damages, consequential damages, compensatory damages, interest, fees and costs.  On August 15, 2016, Great Basin Scientific, Inc. filed a motion to dismiss Ms. Steele s claims.  On October 24, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Utah heard oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss but has not yet issued a ruling.  
 The Company asserts that the claims are without merit and that the employee resigned and was not terminated. 
 We are not currently a party to any other material pending legal proceeding or regulatory or government investigations. We may become involved in litigation from time to time relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of the investigation by the ULC or OSHA, the claim filed in the United States District Court or other claims in the ordinary course of business would have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
     ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    
 Except as set forth below, there have not been any material changes to our risk factors as set forth under the heading  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Commission on March 1, 2016.  
 As part of the convertible note financing for the 2016 Notes, we are required to repay the principal on the convertible notes in installments in cash or shares of common stock and we are required to issue shares upon the exercise of our Series D warrants and Series H warrants. Additionally, our Series F Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Series D warrants, 2016 Notes and related Series H warrants and the Series F Preferred Stock will result in significant dilution to our stockholders.  
 Our stockholders will experience significant dilution as a result of shares of our common stock issued pursuant to outstanding Series D warrants, 2016 Notes and related Series H warrants and our Series F Preferred Stock. Under the Series D warrants, 2016 Notes and related Series H warrants and Series F Preferred Stock, we are required to have reserved or have designated for future issuance a number of shares of common stock necessary to effect the conversion of such convertible notes and preferred stock and the exercise of the Series D warrants and Series H warrants, subject to potential future anti-dilution adjustments.  
 The price at which the Company will convert the 2016 Notes installment amounts is equal to the lowest of (i) the then prevailing conversion price, (ii) 80% of the arithmetic average of the lower of (i) the three lowest daily weighted average prices of the common stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the installment date and (iii) the weighted average price of the common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the installment date, subject in all cases to a floor price of $1.00. 
 For conversions at the election of the holder that are not subject to a floor price, and at the current conversion rate of $1.00 for such conversions, the $75 million in principal amount of 2016 Notes would be convertible into 75,000,000 shares of our common stock. For conversions in relation to the 2016 Notes amortization payments on the convertible notes, if all amortization payments are made at an 80% discount to the current market price per share, approximately $0.02 per share, then we could potentially issue up to approximately 3.75 billion shares of our common stock. 
 Further, we issued Series D warrants issuable to acquire 16.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis, which are subject to a one time reset on December 31, 2016 to 16.6% of our fully diluted shares of common stock on  
 40 

that date. As of November 14, 2016, the Series D warrants were exercisable to acquire 1,290 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment for subsequent issuances.   
 Further, we issued Series H warrants exercisable as of November 14, 2016, to acquire 724,219 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment for certain subsequent issuances.  
 The Series F Preferred Stock is initially convertible at the election of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.02, subject to adjustments. From and after July 3, 2017, the Series F Preferred Stock shall be convertible at a conversion price equal to 85% of the arithmetic average, in each case of the lower of (i) the three lowest daily weighted average prices of the our common stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of determination and (iii) the weighted average price of the our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of determination.  On November 3, 2016, 2,098 Series F Preferred shares were mandatorily converted into 104.9 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.02 per share. Due to shares held in abeyance as described below, as of November 14, 2016 we had converted 1,152 Series F Preferred Shares into shares of common stock pursuant to the mandatory conversion.  946 additional Series F Preferred shares remain to be mandatorily converted for the issuance of 47,300,000 shares of common stock.  On November 3, 2018, so long as no Triggering Event then exists, any remaining Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.02 per share. In each case, shares of our common stock will be held in abeyance to the extent necessary to satisfy limitations on beneficial ownership as described in the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock.  As of November 14, 2016, based on 7,284 shares of Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, at a conversion price of $0.02 per share, we could potentially issue up to 364,200,000 shares of our common stock on conversion of Series F Preferred Stock.  
 Due to the variable nature of the adjustments of the 2016 Notes and Series F Preferred Stock conversion prices and the formula which sets certain conversion prices of these securities based on a discount to the then current market price, the Company could issue more shares of common stock upon conversion of these securities than anticipated above.  This is especially the case if the Company conducts a reverse stock split which increases the per share price in the market but such price subsequently drops below the immediate post-split price. Although we have the option to settle the principal payments on the convertible notes in cash and certain conversion and exercise restrictions are placed upon the holders of the convertible notes and Series D warrants and Series H Warrants, the issuance of material amounts of common stock by us would cause our stockholders to experience significant dilution in their investment in our Company. 
 The convertible notes and the Series F Preferred Stock have anti-dilution provisions triggered by the issuance of shares of common stock and securities exercisable for shares of our common stock at prices below the then current conversion price for the convertible notes, pursuant to which the conversion price of the convertible notes will be adjusted downward and could make it more likely that such convertible notes are converted by the holders diluting our current stockholders and requiring that we reserve more shares for issuance under the convertible notes, which could create an authorized share failure under the terms of the convertible notes.  
 The conversion price of our 2016 Notes, currently $1.00, is subject to reduction upon us issuing shares of our common stock or securities exercisable or convertible for shares of our common stock at a per share price below the then current conversion price. In such case, the conversion price is reduced to be equal to the lowest per share price in the triggering issuance.  
 Our obligations to the holders of our 2016 Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the convertible note holders could foreclose on our assets.  
 Our obligations under the 2016 Notes and the transaction documents relating to those convertible notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. As a result, if we default under our obligations under the convertible notes or the transaction documents, the holders of the convertible notes, acting through their appointed agent, could foreclose on their security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations.  
 The holders of the 2016 Notes have certain additional rights upon an event of default under such convertible notes which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease or operations.  
 Under the 2016 Notes, the holders have certain rights upon an event of default. Such rights include (i) the remaining principal amount of the convertible notes bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum, (ii) during the event of default the conversion price being adjusted to the lowest of (a) the conversion price then in effect, (b) 75% of the lowest weighted average price of the common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the event of default conversion and (c) 75% of the weighted average price of the common stock on the date of the applicable event of default conversion, and (iii) the holder having the right to demand redemption of all or a portion of the convertible notes, as described below. At any time after certain  
 41 

notice requirements for an event of default ar  e triggered, a holder of convertible notes may require us to redeem all or any portion of the convertible note by delivering written notice. Each portion of the convertible note subject to redemption would be redeemed by us in cash by wire transfer of imme  diately available funds at a price equal to the greater of (x) 125% of the conversion amount being redeemed and (y) the product of (A) the conversion amount being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the greatest closing price of the sh  ares of common stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding such event of default and ending on the date the holder delivers the redemption notice, by (II) the lowest conversion price in effect during such period. We may not have suf  ficient funds to settle the redemption price and, as described above, this could trigger rights under the security interest granted to the holders and result in the foreclosure of their security interests and liquidation of some or all of our assets.   
 The exercise of any of these rights upon an event of default could substantially harm our financial condition and force us to reduce or cease operations.  
 Holders of our Series F Preferred Stock have certain additional rights upon the occurrence of certain triggering events which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease or operations. 
 Under the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock, the holders will have certain rights upon a  Triggering Event  (as defined in the Certificate of Designations). Such rights include (i) the remaining principal amount of the Preferred Shares bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum, (ii) during the Triggering Event the conversion price being adjusted to the lowest of (a) the conversion price then in effect, (b) 75% of the lowest weighted average price of the our common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Triggering Event conversion and (c) 75% of the weighted average price of the our common stock on the date of the applicable Triggering Event conversion, and (iii) the holder having the right to demand redemption of all or any number of the preferred shares. 
 At any time after the earlier of the holder s receipt of a notice of an Triggering Event and the holder becoming aware of an Triggering Event and ending on the 15th trading day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event is cured and (y) the holder s receipt of an Triggering Event notice, the holder may require the Company to redeem all or any number of the preferred shares at a price equal to the greater of (x) 125% of the conversion amount being redeemed and (y) the product of (A) the conversion amount being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the greatest closing price of the shares of our common stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding such Triggering Event and ending on the date the holder delivers the redemption notice, by (II) the lowest conversion price in effect during such period. 
   Triggering Event  includes, but is not limited to (and subject to the ability to cure in certain instances): (i) (A) the suspension from trading for more than an aggregate of ten (10) trading days in any 365-day period or (B) the failure of the our common stock to be listed on an eligible market; (ii) the Company's (i) failure to convert the Preferred Shares or related warrants by delivery of the required number of shares of our common stock within five (5) trading days after the applicable conversion or exercise date, (ii) notice of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion or exercise of the Preferred Shares or related warrants or (iii) the Company fails to have sufficient authorized shares to convert the Preferred Shares and related warrants in full for 75 consecutive days. (iii) any payment failure; (iv) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of more than $100,000, individually or in the aggregate, of Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) certain bankruptcy events; (vii) a final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating in excess of $250,000, individually or in the aggregate, are rendered against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and which judgments are not, within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof, bonded, discharged or stayed pending appeal, or are not discharged within seventy-five (75) days after the expiration of such stay; provided, however, that any judgment which is covered by insurance or an indemnity from a credit worthy party shall not be included in calculating the $250,000 amount set forth above so long as the Company provides each holder a written statement from such insurer or indemnity provider (which written statement shall be reasonably satisfactory to such holder) to the effect that such judgment is covered by insurance or an indemnity and the Company will receive the proceeds of such insurance or indemnity within forty-five (45) days of the issuance of such judgment; (viii) breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the Certificate of Designations and related transaction documents; or (ix) the Company's failure for any reason after the date that is six (6) months immediately following the Issuance Date to satisfy the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c) of the 1933 Act. 
 The triggering and exercise of any of these rights could substantially harm our financial condition and force us to reduce or cease operations.

Holders of our Series F Preferred Stock have voting rights on an as converted basis. These rights permit the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock to vote up to certain percentage of our outstanding voting securities. The   holders of the preferred shares may have interests in matters brought before the shareholders that are different than holders of common stock.   
 The holders of Series F Preferred Stock have the right to vote with holders of shares of our common stock, voting together as one class on all matters, with each Series F Preferred share entitling the holder thereof to cast that number of votes per share as is equal to the aggregate number of shares of our common stock into which it is then convertible (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth in the Certificate of Designations including without limitation, the maximum percentage and/or the failure to have a sufficient number of shares of common stock reserved or available for issuance pursuant to the Certificate of Designations) using the record date for determining the stockholders of the Company eligible to vote on such matters as the date as of which the conversion price is calculated; provided, that no holder (together with such holder s attribution parties) shall be permitted to have a number of votes in excess of such aggregate number of votes granted to the holders of 9.99% of the shares our common stock then outstanding (including any votes with respect to any shares of our common stock and preferred stock beneficially owned by the holder or such holder s attribution parties). 
 The holders of the Series F Preferred Stock may have interests in matters brought before the shareholders that are different than the interests of holders of our common stock. Specifically, the holders of our Series F Preferred Stock are also holders of our 2016 Notes and their interests in relation to shareholder matters that affect the 2016 Notes will be different that the interests of holders of our common stock. While the Series F Preferred Stock holders do not act as a group in the instances where their interests are aligned, their ability to cast votes on an as converted basis may affect the outcome of any shareholder votes on such matters. 
 Broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares of common stock because they are considered a penny stock and are subject to the penny stock rules. 
 Our shares of common stock are currently considered a  penny stock.  The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines  penny stock  to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The shares of common stock are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and  accredited investors.  The term  accredited investor  refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the shares of common stock. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade in the shares of common stock. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 All unregistered sales of equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K. 
 Use of Proceeds 
 Use of Proceeds from Initial Public Offering 
 On October 8, 2014, the SEC declared effective our IPO registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-197954) related to 1,150,000 shares of common stock and 1,150,000 Series A Warrants, which were sold in combinations of one share of common stock and one Series A Warrant at a public offering price of $7.00 per unit; however, as a result of the offering of units by the Company on February 25, 2015, the Series A Warrants were exercisable at an exercise price of $2.20 per share. Each Series A Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock and one Series B Warrant. In addition, the managing underwriter, Dawson James Securities, Inc. exercised its option to purchase 172,500 Series A Warrants. The IPO commenced on October 8, 2014 and has not yet  
 43 

terminate  d in relation to the Series B Warrants covered under the IPO registration statement. As of October 15, 2015, the date the Series A Warrants expired, 1,074,082 Series A Warrants had been exercised, none of which were exercised on a cashless basis. The remai  ning 248,418 Series A Warrants outstanding expired without being exercised. No Series B Warrants have been exercised to date. We may receive additional proceeds if any of the Series B Warrants are exercised in the future.  
 The aggregate sale price for securities sold at the initial closing of the IPO is $8,050,000. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the IPO was approximately $6.4 million after deducting total expenses of approximately $1,650,000, including approximately $644,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately $1,006,000 in other expenses payable by the Company. Since the initial closing of the IPO the Company has received $2.4 million in additional net proceeds from the exercise of Series A Warrants, for total net proceeds from the offering in the amount of $8.8 million. 
 None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or offering expenses were paid, directly or indirectly, to any of our directors or officers or their associates or to persons owning 10% or more of our common stock or to any of our affiliates. 
 As of September 30, 2016, all of the $8.8 million of total net proceeds from our IPO has been used. We had broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our IPO. The table below shows a comparison of the use of proceeds as disclosed in our IPO Prospectus with the actual usage of these net proceeds (in millions):

     B. The holders of shares of the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders of the Corporation and shall be entitled to one vote for each share thereof held of record. 
   C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time by the board of directors as shares of one or more classes or series, without further stockholder approval. Subject to the provisions hereof and the limitations prescribed by law, the board of directors is  

expressly authorized, by adopting resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of any particular class or series and, if and to the extent from time to time required by law, by filing with the Delaware Secretary of State a certificate setting forth the resolutions so adopted pursuant to the DGCL, to establish the number of shares to be included in each such class or series and to fix the designation and relative powers, including voting powers (which may be full, limited or non-voting powers), preferences, rights, qualifications and limitations and restrictions thereof, relating to the shares of each such class or series. The rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of any such additional class or series may be subordinated to, pari passu with (including, without limitation, inclusion in provisions with respect to liquidation and acquisition preferences, redemption and/or approval of matters by vote), or senior to any of those of any present or future class or series of Preferred Stock or Common Stock. The board of directors is also authorized to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of any class or series of Preferred Stock prior or subsequent to the issue of that class or series, but not below the number of shares of such class or series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any class or series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such class or series.  
 The authority of the board of directors with respect to each class or series shall include, but not be limited to, determination of the following: 
 (i) the distinctive class or serial designation of such class or series and the number of shares constituting such class or series; 
 (ii) the annual dividend rate on shares of such class or series, if any, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, from which date or dates; 
 (iii) whether the shares of such class or series shall be redeemable and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption, including the date or dates upon and after which such shares shall be redeemable, and the amount per share payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under different conditions and at different redemption dates; 
 (iv) the obligation, if any, of the Corporation to retire shares of such class or series pursuant to a sinking fund;

 (viii) any other relative rights, powers, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof relating to such class or series.

The board of directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as may be feasible, hereby designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. For the purposes hereof, the initial Class I, Class II and Class III directors shall be so designated by a resolution of the board of directors. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting of stockholders at which such director was elected, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal; provided, however, that the directors first elected to Class I shall serve for a term ending on the Corporation s first annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the directors first elected to Class II shall serve for a term ending on the Corporation s second annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and the directors first elected to Class III shall serve for a term ending on the Corporation s third annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

 2 

directors, whether because of death, resignation, disqualification, an increase in the authorized number of directors, removal, or any other cause, may be filled by a vote of the majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. When the board of directors fills a vacancy, the director chosen to fill that vacancy shall complete the term of the director he or she succeeds (or shall complete the term of the class of directors in which the new directorship was created) and shall hold office until such director s successor shall have been elected and qualified or until such director s earlier death, resignation or removal. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director s term of office. Directors shall continue in office until others are elected and qualified in their stead, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. When the number of directors is changed, each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he or she is a member until the expiration of his or her current term, and any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships shall be so assigned among the classes by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as may be feasible. Any director (other than the Hitachi Director) or the entire board of directors may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, but only for cause.  
 Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of members of the board of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the bylaws of the Corporation. 
 Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide. 
 ARTICLE VI 
 To the extent permitted by law, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if: (i) a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present, and (ii) such action has been earlier approved by the board of directors. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the board of directors or the Chief Executive Officer or by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board of directors. 
 ARTICLE VII 
 In furtherance and not in limitation of the power conferred upon the board of directors by law, the board of directors shall have power to adopt, amend, alter and repeal from time to time the bylaws of the Corporation by majority vote of all directors except that any provision of the bylaws requiring, for board action, a vote of greater than a majority of the board shall not be amended, altered or repealed except by such supermajority vote. The stockholders of the Corporation may only adopt, amend or repeal bylaws with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon. 
 ARTICLE VIII 
 The Corporation reserves the right to amend this Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in any manner provided herein or permitted by the DGCL, and all rights and powers, if any, conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers are subject to the reserved power. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the affirmative vote of the holders of sixty percent of the voting power of all of the shares of the stock outstanding entitled to vote thereon, voting as a single class, the Corporation shall not alter, amend or repeal Article V, Article VI, Article VIII, or Article IX of this Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the provisions of Article IV providing for undesignated Preferred Stock. 
 3 

ARTICLE IX  
 A. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. 
 B. The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she, his or her testator or intestate is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation, or serves or served at any other enterprise as a director or officer at the request of the Corporation, or any predecessor to the Corporation. 
 C. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision. 
 FOURTH:  This Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly approved by the board of directors of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  
 FIFTH:  This Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly approved, in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, by the written consent of the holders of the requisite number of the shares of outstanding stock of entitled to vote thereon, and written notice of such action will be given to the holders of such shares who did not so consent, in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 (a)  Procedures for holder Conversion  . In order to effectuate a conversion of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5.1(a), a holder shall submit a written election to the Corporation and the Corporation s Transfer Agent, and that such holder elects to convert such shares, the number of shares elected to be converted.

 5.4  Reservation of Stock  . The Corporation shall at all times when any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of capital stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.

5.5   Limitations on Conversion   . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate, the Series E Preferred Stock shall not be convertible by a holder to the extent (but only to the extent) that the holder or any of its Affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (the     Maximum Percentage      ) of the Common Stock. To the extent the above limitation applies, the determination of whether the holder s shares shall be convertible (vis- -vis other convertible securities owned by the holder or any of its Affiliates) and of which such securities shall be convertible (as among all such securities owned by the holder) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Corporation for conversion. No prior inability to convert the shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. For the purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations     promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this paragraph to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock. The holders of Common Stock shall be third party beneficiaries of this paragraph and the Corporation may not amend or waive this paragraph without the consent of holders of a majority of its Common Stock.

 RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors designates the Series F Convertible Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting such series, and fixes the rights, powers, preferences, privileges and restrictions relating to such series in addition to any set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation as follows: 
 TERMS OF SERIES F CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
 1.   Designation and Number of Shares . There shall hereby be created and established a series of preferred stock of the Company designated as  Series F Convertible Preferred Stock  (the   Preferred Shares  ), which shall be issued in exchange for certain 2015 Notes, originally issued pursuant to the 2015 SPA, by and among the Company and each initial holder of Preferred Shares The authorized number of Preferred Shares shall be 8,436 shares . Each Preferred Share shall have a par value of  $0.001 . Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning as set forth in Section 31 below.  
   2.   Ranking . Except to the extent that the Required Holders expressly consent in writing to the creation of Parity Stock (as defined below) or Senior Preferred Stock (as defined below) in accordance with Section 14, all shares of capital stock of the Company shall be junior in rank to all Preferred Shares with respect to the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company (such junior stock is referred to herein collectively as   Junior Stock  ). The rights of all such shares of capital stock of the Company shall be subject to the rights, powers, preferences and privileges of the Preferred Shares.  Without limiting any other provision of this Certificate of Designations, without the prior express written consent of the Required Holders, voting separate as a single class, the Company shall not hereafter authorize or issue any additional or other shares of capital stock that is (i) of senior rank to the Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company (collectively, the   Senior Preferred Stock  ), (ii) of pari passu rank to the Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company (collectively, the   Parity Stock  ) or (iii) any Junior Stock having a maturity date (or any other date requiring redemption or repayment of such shares of Junior Stock) that is prior to the date that is ninety (90) days after the date no Preferred Shares remain outstanding.  In the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Preferred Shares shall maintain their relative rights, powers, designations, privileges and preferences provided for herein and no such Fundamental Transaction shall be inconsistent therewith. 
         3.   Dividends .        
 (a) From and after the first date of issuance of any Preferred Shares (the    Initial Issuance Date  , and the date of initial issuance of any given Preferred Share, an   Issuance Date  ), each holder of Preferred Shares (each, a   Holder   and collectively, the   Holders  ) shall be entitled to receive dividends (  Dividends  ) when, if and as declared by the Board of Directors, from time to time, in its sole discretion, which Dividends shall be paid by the Company out of funds legally available therefor, payable, subject to the conditions and other terms hereof, in cash on the Stated Value of such Preferred Share. 
   (b) Dividends on each Preferred Share shall commence accruing immediately upon the occurrence of, and shall continue accruing during the continuance of, a Triggering Event, at the Default Rate and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and shall be payable, if applicable, in arrears for each calendar month on the first (1st) Business Day of each calendar month after any such Dividends accrues after a Triggering Event (each, an    Dividends Date  ).  Dividends, if any, shall be payable on each Dividends Date to each Holder of a Preferred Share on the applicable Dividends Date in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to wire instruction provided by such Holder in writing to the Company.  Prior to the payment of Dividends on an Dividends Date, Dividends on each Preferred Share shall accrue at the Default Rate and be payable by way of inclusion of the Dividends in the Conversion Amount (as defined in Section 4(b)(i)) on each Conversion Date (as defined in Section 4(c)(i)) in accordance with Section 4(c)(i) and/or on each  
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

Redemption Date.  In the event that such Triggering Event is subsequently cured, the Dividends shall cease to accrue as of the date of such cure; provided, that the Dividends as calculated and unpaid as of the cure of such Triggering Event shall continue to be due and payable as set forth above; provided, further, that for the purpose of this Section 3, such Triggering Event shall not be deemed cured with respect to any given Holder unless and until any accrued and unpaid Dividends shall be paid to such Holder.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Dividends payable on any Dividends Date shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis for each dollar received by any given Holder since the immediately preceding Dividends Date (or, with respect to the first Dividends Date hereunder, since the Issuance Date) as a cash Distribution in accordance with Section 13.  
   4.  Conversion. At any time or times after the Initial Issuance Date, each Preferred Share shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4. 
       (a)   Holder s Conversion Right . Subject to the provisions of Section 4(d), at any time or times on or after the Issuance Date, each Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding Preferred Shares held by such Holder into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below).  The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion.  If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all transfer, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion of any Conversion Amount. 
   (b)   Conversion Rate . The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Share pursuant to Section 4(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share by (y) the Conversion Price (the   Conversion Rate  ): 
   (i)       Conversion Amount   means, with respect to each Preferred Share, as of the applicable date of determination, the sum of (1) the Stated Value to be converted, redeemed or otherwise with respect to which this determination is being made plus (2) any accrued and unpaid Late Charges, if any, with respect to such Stated Value. 
 (ii)     Conversion Price   means, with respect to each Preferred Share, as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, $0.02, subject to adjustment as provided herein. 
   (c)   Mechanics of Conversion . The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner: 
         (i)          Optional Conversion . To convert a Preferred Share into shares of Common Stock on any date (a   Conversion Date  ), a Holder shall (A) transmit by facsimile or electronic mail (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit I  (the   Conversion Notice  ) to the Company and (B) if required by Section 4(c)(iii), but without delaying the Company's requirement to deliver shares of Common Stock on the applicable Share Delivery Date (as defined below), such Holder shall surrender to a common carrier for delivery to the Company the original certificates representing the Preferred Shares (the   Preferred Share Certificates  ) so converted as aforesaid as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to such Preferred Share Certificates in the case of its loss, theft or destruction).  On or before the second (2nd) Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile or electronic mail a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Company's transfer agent (the   Transfer Agent  ).  On or before the third (3rd) Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the   Share Delivery   Date  ), the Company shall (x) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company (  DTC  ) Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program and the Conversion Shares can then be immediately sold or transferred by such Holder pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled to such Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian system or (y) otherwise, issue and deliver to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of such Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled pursuant to such conversion.  If the number of Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii) is greater than the number of Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Trading Days after receipt of the Preferred Share Certificate(s) and at its own expense, issue and deliver to such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in  
 2 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the number of Preferred Shares not converted.   The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of each Preferred Share shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date, irrespective of the date such Conversion Shares are credited to such Holder's account with DTC or the date of delivery of the certificates evidencing such Conversion Shares, as the case may be.      
       (ii)          Company s Failure to Timely Convert . If the Company shall fail for any reason or for no reason on or prior to the applicable Share Delivery Date to issue and deliver a certificate to a Holder or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC, as required pursuant to the terms of Section 4(c)(i), for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion of any Preferred Shares (a   Conversion Failure  ), then such Holder, upon written notice to the Company, may void its Conversion Notice with respect to, and retain or have returned, as the case may be, such Preferred Shares that have not been converted pursuant to such Conversion Notice;  provided  that the voiding of a Conversion Notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to this Section 4(c)(ii) or otherwise.  In addition to the foregoing, if the Company shall fail on or prior to the Share Delivery Date to issue and deliver a certificate to such Holder, if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program or the Conversion Shares can then not be immediately sold or transferred by such Holder pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC, if the Transfer Agent is participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program and the Conversion Shares can then be immediately sold or transferred by such Holder pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion of any Preferred Shares or on any date of the Company's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock as contemplated pursuant to clause (y) below, and if on or after such Trading Day such Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion that such Holder anticipated receiving from the Company (a   Buy-In  ), then the Company shall, within three (3) Trading Days after such Holder's request and in such Holder's discretion, either (x) pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (the   Buy-In Price  ), at which point the Company's obligation to issue and deliver such certificate or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC for the shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion of the applicable Preferred Shares shall terminate, or (y) promptly honor its obligation to deliver to such Holder a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC, as required pursuant to the terms of Section 4(c)(i), for such shares of Common Stock and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock, times (B) the Buy-In Price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any).  Nothing shall limit such Holder's right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company's failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock (or to electronically deliver such shares of Common Stock) upon the conversion of each Preferred Share as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 
         (iii)          Registration; Book-Entry . The Company shall maintain a register (the   Register  ) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Holders of each Preferred Share and number and Stated Value of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the   Registered Preferred Shares  ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.  The Company and each Holder of the Preferred Shares shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Preferred Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold, in whole or in part, only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register.  Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder thereof, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Preferred Shares in the same aggregate Stated Value as the Stated Value of the surrendered Registered Preferred Shares to the designated assignee or transferee pursuant to Section 18.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(c)(iii), subject to (and not in lieu of) the transfer restrictions set forth in the 2015 SPA, a Holder may assign any Preferred Share to an Affiliate of such Holder or a Related Fund of such Holder without delivering a request to assign or sell such Preferred Share to the Company and the recordation of such assignment or sale in the Register (a   Related Party Assignment    provided , that (x) the Company may continue to deal solely with such assigning or selling Holder unless and until such Holder has delivered a request to assign or sell such Preferred Share to the Company for recordation in the Register; (y) the failure of such assigning or selling Holder to deliver a request to assign or sell  
 3 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

such Preferred Share to the Company shall not affect the legality, validity, or binding effect of such assignment or sale and (z) such assigning or selling Holder shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Company, maintain a register (the    Related Party Register   ) comparable to the Register on behalf of the Company, and any such assignment or sale shall be effective upon recordation of such assignment or sale in the Related Party Register.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of any Preferred Share Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof, such Holder shall not be required to physically surrender a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full number of Preferred Shares represented by such Preferred Share Certificate is being converted or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of each Preferred Share upon physical surrender of such Preferred Share Certificate.  The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Stated Value, Dividends, if any, and Late Charges, if any, converted, and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of each Preferred Share Certificate upon conversion.  If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value, Dividend and Late Charges converted and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days of such occurrence, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence.     
 (iv)    Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes . In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23. 
               (d)   Limitation on Beneficial Ownership .      The Company  shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder, and such Holder shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Certificate of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess of either 4.99% or 9.99% (as designated by the applicable Holder on the signature page of such Holder to the Exchange Agreement of such Holder (the   Maximum Percentage  ) of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and the other Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes, convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the 2016 Notes and the Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other Attribution Party subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d).  For purposes of this Section 4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act.  For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion of such Preferred Shares without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the   Reported Outstanding Share Number  ).  If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder s beneficial ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of a reduced number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice.  For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares,  
 4 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

by such Holder and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported.  In the event that the issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder s and the other Attribution Parties  aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the    Excess Shares   ) shall be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the sixty-first (61   st   ) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party of such Holder.  For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act.  The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 4(d) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d) or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.  The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares  .  
   (e)   Automatic Conversion At Maturity . On the second anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date (the   Maturity Date  ), so long as no Triggering Event then exists or is continuing, each Preferred Share that remains outstanding hereunder shall automatically convert (the " Maturity Automatic Conversion ") into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.02 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations recapitalizations and similar events occurring after the Subscription Date) (the   Maturity Automatic Conversion Price  ) in accordance with the mechanics set forth in Section 4(c) (with  Maturity Automatic Conversion Price  replacing  Conversion Price  for all purposes hereunder with respect thereto and with a Conversion Notice for such Preferred Shares subject to such Maturity Automatic Conversion being deemed to have been delivered by such Holder to the Company on the third (3 rd ) Trading Day immediately prior to the Maturity Date) ( provided ,  however , that to the extent that the Maturity Automatic Conversion would result in any Holder and such Holder's other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder's Preferred Shares shall not automatically converted pursuant to the Maturity Automatic Conversion to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Maturity Automatic Conversion (and beneficial ownership) to such extent) and the portion of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to such Holder pursuant to the Maturity Automatic Conversion shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and such Holder's other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times such Holder shall be granted such shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to such Holder pursuant to the Maturity Automatic Conversion to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation). 
   (f)   Alternate Conversion .    
 (i)    General .  Subject to Section 4(d), at any time after the eight month anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date (or such other date as mutually determined by the Company and the Required Holders), a Holder may, at such Holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the date of any such Conversion Notice, each an   Alternate Conversion Date  ), convert all, or any number of Preferred Shares (such Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 4(f), the   Alternate Conversion Amount  ) into shares of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, a    Alternate Conversion  ).  
 (ii)    Mechanics of Alternate Conversion .  On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any Alternate Conversion Amount pursuant to Section 4(c) (with  Alternate Conversion Price  replacing  Conversion Price  for all purposes hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(f) of this Certificate of Designations that such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(f), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers shares of Common Stock representing the applicable Alternate Conversion Amount to such Holder, such Alternate Conversion Amount may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c) without regard to this Section 4(f). 
   (g)   Automatic Conversion . On the first (1 st ) Trading Day after the date hereof (or such other date as mutually determined by the Company and the Required Holders) (the   Automatic Conversion Date  ), so long as no Triggering Event  
 5 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

then exists or is continuing, such aggregate number of Preferred Shares with respect to each Holder convertible into such Holder s Initial Required Reservation Amount (as set forth on the signature page such Holder s Exchange Agreement) (less any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed issued) to such Holder with respect to any Conversion Notice(s) of such Holder delivered to the Company on or prior to the Automatic Conversion Date) (rounded down to the nearest Preferred Share for each Holder) shall automatically convert (the "  Automatic Conversion  ") into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.02 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations recapitalizations and similar events occurring after the Subscription Date) (the    Automatic Conversion Price   )   in accordance with the mechanics set forth in Section 4(c) (with  Automatic Conversion Price  replacing  Conversion Price  for all purposes hereunder with respect thereto and     with a Conversion Notice for such applicable Preferred Shares subject to the Automatic Conversion being deemed to have been delivered by such Holder to the Company on the third (3   rd   ) Trading Day immediately prior to the Automatic Conversion Date) (  provided  ,   however  , that to the extent that the Automatic Conversion would result in any Holder and such Holder's other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder's Preferred Shares shall not automatically converted pursuant to the Automatic Conversion to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Automatic Conversion (and beneficial ownership) to such extent) and the portion of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to such Holder pursuant to the Automatic Conversion shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and such Holder's other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times such Holder shall be granted such shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to such Holder pursuant to the Automatic Conversion to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).  
   5.   Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions . 
               (a)   Assumption         . The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the Successor Entity assumes in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5(a) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders and approved by the Required Holders prior to such Fundamental Transaction, including agreements, if so requested by such Holder, to deliver to such Holder in exchange for such Preferred Shares of such Holder, a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Preferred Shares, including, without limitation, having a stated value and dividend rate equal to the Stated Value amount and the Default Rate of the Preferred Shares then outstanding, having similar conversion rights and having similar ranking to the Preferred Shares, and satisfactory to the Required Holders.  Upon the occurrence or consummation of any Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the Successor Entity (or in which the Common Stock ceases to be registered under the 1934 Act), and it shall be a required condition to the occurrence or consummation of any Fundamental Transaction that, the Company and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally, shall succeed to, and the Company shall cause any Successor Entity or Successor Entities to jointly and severally succeed to, and be added to the term  Company  under this Certificate of Designations  (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, each and every provision of this Certificate of Designations referring to the  Company  shall refer instead to each of the Company and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally), and the Company and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally, may exercise every right and power of the Company prior thereto and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company prior thereto under this Certificate of Designations with the same effect as if the Company and such Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally, had been named as the Company in this Certificate of Designations, and, solely at the request of such Holder, if the Successor Entity and/or Successor Entities is a publicly traded corporation whose common capital stock is quoted on or listed for trading on an Eligible Market, shall deliver (in addition to and without limiting any right under this Certificate of Designations ) to such Holder in exchange for each Preferred Share a security of the Successor Entity and/or Successor Entities evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to each Preferred Share and convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of the Successor Entity and/or Successor Entities (the   Successor Capital Stock  ) equivalent (as set forth below) to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of each Preferred Share (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of each Preferred Share) prior to such Fundamental Transaction (such corresponding number of shares of Successor Capital Stock to be delivered to such Holder shall be equal to the greater of (I) the quotient of (A) the aggregate dollar value of all consideration (including cash consideration and any consideration other than cash (  Non-Cash Consideration  ), in such Fundamental Transaction, as such values are set forth in any definitive agreement for the Fundamental Transaction that has been executed at the time of the first public announcement of the Fundamental Transaction or, if no such value is determinable from such definitive agreement, as determined in accordance with Section 23 with the term  Non-Cash Consideration  being substituted for the term  Conversion Price ) that such Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Fundamental Transaction, had each Preferred Share been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Fundamental Transaction (without regard

to any limitations on the conversion of each Preferred Share) (the    Aggregate Consideration   ) divided by (B) the per share Closing Sale Price of such corresponding Successor Capital Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the consummation or occurrence of the Fundamental Transaction and (II) the product of (A) the Aggregate Consideration and (B) the highest exchange ratio pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company may exchange Common Stock for Successor Capital Stock) (  provided  ,   however  , to the extent that a Holder's right to receive any such shares of publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity would result in such Holder and its other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, if applicable, then such Holder shall not be entitled to receive such shares to such extent (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity as a result of such consideration to such extent) and the portion of such shares shall be held in abeyance for such Holder until such time or times, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and its other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times such Holder shall be delivered such shares to the extent as if there had been no such limitation), and such security shall be satisfactory to such Holder, and with an identical conversion price to the Conversion Price hereunder (such adjustments to the number of shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting after the consummation or occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction the economic value of each Preferred Share that was in effect immediately prior to the consummation or occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, as elected by such Holder solely at its option).  Upon occurrence or consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, and it shall be a required condition to the occurrence or consummation of such Fundamental Transaction that, the Company and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion of each Preferred Share at any time after the occurrence or consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, as elected by such Holder solely at its option, shares of Common Stock, Successor Capital Stock or, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock or Successor Capital Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property purchasable upon the conversion of each Preferred Share prior to such Fundamental Transaction), such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other property whatsoever (including warrants or other purchase or subscription rights), which for purposes of clarification may continue to be shares of Common Stock, if any, that such Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Fundamental Transaction, had each Preferred Share been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of each Preferred Share), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations.  The provisions of this Section 5(a) shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions.      
     6.   Redemptions.  
       (a)   Triggering Event Redemption Right .  Upon the occurrence of any Triggering Event, the Company shall within two (2) Business Day deliver written notice thereof via facsimile or electronic mail and overnight courier (an   Triggering Event Notice  ) to each Holder.  A Triggering Event Notice shall include (I) a reasonable description of the applicable Triggering Event, (II) a certification as to whether, in the opinion of the Company, such Triggering Event is capable of being cured and, if applicable, a reasonable description of any existing plans of the Company to cure such Triggering Event and (III) a certification as to the date the Triggering Event occurred. Provided that the Lead Investor shall have required the Company to redeem all or any the Lead Investor's Preferred Shares in connection with the applicable Triggering Event (the aggregate number of Preferred Shares of the Lead Investor subject to such redemption, the   Lead Investor Redemption Preferred Shares  ), at any time after the earlier of a Holder's receipt of a Triggering Event Notice and such Holder becoming aware of a Triggering Event and ending on the fifteenth (15th) Trading Day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event is cured and (y) such Holder's receipt of a Triggering Event Notice, such Holder may require the Company to redeem (an   Triggering Event Redemption  ) all, or part, of such aggregate number of Preferred Shares of such Holder not in excess of the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Preferred Shares that are then held by such Holder and (ii) a fraction (I) the numerator of which equals the Lead Investor Redemption Preferred Shares and (II) the denominator of which equals the aggregate number of Preferred Shares of the Lead Investor that is then outstanding, then, by delivering written notice thereof (the   Triggering Event Redemption Notice  ) to the Company, which Triggering Event Redemption Notice shall indicate the aggregate number of Preferred Shares that such Holder is electing to require the Company to redeem.  Each Preferred Share subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall be redeemed by the Company in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds at a price equal to the greater of (x) 125% of the Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares being redeemed and (y) the product of (A) the Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the shares of Common Stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding such Triggering Event and ending on the date the applicable Holder delivers the Triggering Event Redemption Notice, by (II) the lowest Conversion Price in effect during such period (the   Triggering Event   Redemption Price  ).  Redemptions required by this Section 6(a) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(a), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Triggering Event Redemption Price (together with any interest thereon) is paid in full, the  
 7 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares submitted for redemption under this Section 6(a) may be converted, in whole or in part, by the applicable Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.To the extent redemptions required by this Section 6(a) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Preferred Shares by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments.  The parties hereto agree that in the event of the Company's redemption of any Preferred Shares under this Section 6(a), a Holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder.  Accordingly, any Triggering Event redemption premium due under this Section 6(a) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder's actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.      
           (b)   Change of Control Redemption Right . No sooner than twenty (20) days nor later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile or electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a   Change of Control   Notice  ).  At any time during the period beginning on the earlier to occur of (x) any oral or written agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, upon consummation of which the transaction contemplated thereby would reasonably be expected to result in a Change of Control, (y) a Holder becoming aware of a Change of Control and (z) such Holder's receipt of a Change of Control Notice and ending twenty-five (25) Trading Days after the date of the consummation of such Change of Control, such Holder may require the Company to redeem (a   Change of Control Redemption  ) all, or part, of the Preferred Shares of such Holder by delivering written notice thereof (  Change of Control Redemption Notice    ) to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the aggregate number of Preferred Shares of such Holder that such Holder is electing to require the Company to redeem.  The aggregate number of Preferred Shares of such Holder subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 6(b) shall be redeemed by the Company in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds at a price equal to the greater of (x) 125% of the Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares of such Holder being redeemed and (y) the product of (A) the Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares of such Holder being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the shares of Common Stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding the earlier to occur of (x) the consummation of the Change of Control and (y) the public announcement of such Change of Control and ending on the date such Holder delivers the Change of Control Redemption Notice,   by (II) the lowest Conversion Price in effect during such period (the   Change of Control Redemption Price      ).  Redemptions required by this Section 6(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 and shall have priority to payments to stockholders in connection with a Change of Control.  To the extent redemptions required by this Section 6(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Preferred Shares by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(b), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Change of Control Redemption Price is paid in full, the Preferred Shares submitted for redemption under this Section 6(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.  The parties hereto agree that in the event of the Company's redemption of any Preferred Shares under this Section 6(b), a Holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder.  Accordingly, any Change of Control redemption premium due under this Section 6(b)  is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such Holder's actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. 
     (c)   Company Optional Redemptions .  At any time after the Initial Issuance Date, the Company shall have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Shares, the   Company Optional Redemption Amount  ) as designated in the Company Optional Redemption Notice on the Company Optional Redemption Date (each as defined below) (a   Company Optional Redemption  ).  The Preferred Shares subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 6(c) shall be redeemed by the Company on the Company Optional Redemption Date in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to wire instructions provided by each applicable Holder in writing to the Company at a price equal to greater of (x) 125% of the Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares being redeemed and (y) the product of (A) the Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the shares of Common Stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date and ending on the Company Optional Redemption Date (each as defined below), by (II) the lowest Conversion Price in effect during such period (the   Company Optional Redemption Price  ).  The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 6(c)  by delivering a written notice thereof by facsimile or electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (the   Company Optional Redemption Notice   and the date all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the   Company Optional Redemption Notice Dat e ).  The Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable.  The Company Optional Redemption Notice shall (i) state the date on which the Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the   Company Optional Redemption Date  ), which date shall not be less than fifteen (15) Trading Days nor more than twenty-five (25) Trading  
 8 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

Days following the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date and (ii) state the aggregate Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares which the Company has elected to be subject to Company Optional Redemption from each Holder pursuant to this Section 6(c) on the Company Optional Redemption Date.  The Company may not effect more than one (1) Company Optional Redemption.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(c), until the Company Optional Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Preferred Shares of a Holder may be converted, in whole or in part, by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.  All Conversion Amounts converted by such Holder after the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the Company Optional Redemption Amount of each Preferred Share required to be redeemed on the Company Optional Redemption Date, unless such Holder otherwise indicates in the applicable Conversion Notice.  Company Optional Redemptions made pursuant to this Section 6(c) shall be made in accordance with Section 6(d)To the extent redemptions required by this Section 6(c) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Preferred Shares by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments.  The parties hereto agree that in the event of the Company's redemption of any portion of the Preferred Share under this Section 6(c), a Holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such Holder.  
   (d) Redemption Mechanics. If a Holder has submitted a Triggering Event Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 6(a), the Company shall deliver the applicable Triggering Event Redemption Price to such Holder in cash within three (3) Business Days after the Company s receipt of such Triggering Event Redemption Notice (each, a    Triggering Event Redemption Date  ).   If a Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 6(b), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to such Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within three (3) Business Days after the Company s receipt of such notice otherwise (each, a   Change of Control Redemption Date  ).  The Company shall deliver the Company Optional Redemption Price on the Company Optional Redemption Date. The Company shall pay the applicable Redemption Price to the applicable Holder in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to wire instruction provided by such Holder in writing to the Company on the applicable due date.  In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Preferred Shares, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to such Holder a new Preferred Certificate (in accordance with Section 18) representing the number of Preferred Shares which have not been redeemed and with a Stated Value as if no Redemption Notice has been delivered. In the event that the Company does not pay the applicable Redemption Price to a Holder within the time period required for any reason (including, without limitation, to the extent such payment is prohibited pursuant to the DGCL), at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, such Holder shall have the option, in lieu of redemption, to require the Company to promptly return to such Holder all or any of the Preferred Shares that were submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price has not been paid.  Upon the Company's receipt of such notice, (x) the applicable Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such Preferred Shares, (y) the Company shall immediately return each Preferred Share Certificate, or issue a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 18) to such Holder representing such Preferred Shares to be redeemed and (z) the Conversion Price of such Preferred Shares shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the applicable Redemption Notice is voided and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price of the Common Stock during the period beginning on and including the date on which the applicable Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on and including the date on which the applicable Redemption Notice is voided.  The Holder's delivery of a notice voiding a Redemption Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments of Late Charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the Preferred Shares subject to such notice.   
 (e) Redemption by Multiple Holders.  Upon the Company s receipt of a Redemption Notice from any Holder for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in this Section 6, the Company shall immediately, but no later than one (1) Business Day of its receipt thereof, forward to each other Holder by facsimile or electronic mail a copy of such notice. If the Company receives one or more Redemption Notices, during the seven (7) Business Day period beginning on and including the date which is three (3) Business Days prior to the Company s receipt of the initial Redemption Notice and ending on and including the date which is three (3) Business Days after the Company s receipt of the initial Redemption Notice and the Company is unable to redeem all Stated Value and other amounts designated in such initial Redemption Notice and such other Redemption Notices received during such seven (7) Business Day period, then the Company shall redeem a pro rata amount from each Holder based on the Stated Value of the Preferred Shares submitted for redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notices received by the Company during such seven (7) Business Day period.  
   (f) Insufficient Assets.  If upon a Redemption Date, the assets of the Company are insufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price, the Company shall (i) take all appropriate action reasonably within its means to maximize the   
 9 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

assets available for paying the applicable Redemption Price, (ii) redeem out of all such assets available therefor on the applicable Redemption Date the maximum possible Conversion Amount that it can redeem on such date, pro rata among the Holders to be redeemed in proportion to the aggregate number of Preferred Shares outstanding on the applicable Redemption Date and (iii) following the applicable Redemption Date, at any time and from time to time when additional assets of the Company become available to redeem the remaining Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares, the Company shall use such assets, at the end of the then current calendar month, to redeem the balance of such Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares, or such portion thereof for which assets are then available, on the basis set forth above at the applicable Redemption Price, and such assets will not be used prior to the end of such calendar month for any other purpose.   
   7.   Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events . 
   (a)   Purchase Rights . If at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all or substantially all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the   Purchase Rights  ), then each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares) held by such Holder immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, that to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to the extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to the extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage) , at which time or times such Holder shall be granted such right  (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right to be held similarly in abeyance)  to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation) . 
   (b)   Other Corporate Events .  In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the occurrence or consummation of any Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities, cash, assets or other property with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a " Corporate Event "), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that, and any applicable Successor Entity or Successor Entities shall ensure that, and it shall be a required condition to the occurrence or consummation of such Corporate Event that, the Holders will thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at any time after the occurrence or consummation of the Corporate Event, shares of Common Stock or Successor Capital Stock or, if so elected by any Holder, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) purchasable upon the conversion of such Holder's Preferred Shares prior to such Corporate Event (but not in lieu of such items still issuable under Sections 7(a) and 13, which shall continue to be receivable on the Common Stock or on such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other property otherwise receivable with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock prior to the date of consummation of such Corporate Event), such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other property whatsoever (including warrants or other purchase or subscription rights and any shares of Common Stock) which such Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence or consummation of such Corporate Event or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Corporate Event, had Holder's Preferred Shares been converted immediately prior to such Corporate Event or the record, eligibility or other determination date for the event resulting in such Corporate Event (without regard to any limitations on conversion of the Preferred Shares).  Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders.  The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events.   
             8.   Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 
       (a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock.   If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date, the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, or the Company publicly announces the issuance or sale of, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have been issued or sold, by the Company (x) in connection with any Excluded Securities, (y) for which the applicable Holder received a Distribution in at least an equivalent amount pursuant to Section 13 and (z) adjusting the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 8(b)), for a consideration per share (the   New   
 10 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

Issuance Price   ) less than a price (the    Applicable Price   ) equal to the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale (the foregoing a    Dilutive Issuance   ), then immediately after such Dilutive Issuance the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price.  For purposes of determining the adjusted Conversion Price under this Section 8(a), the following shall be applicable:  
     (i)        Issuance of Options .  If the Company in any manner grants or sells, or the Company publicly announces the issuance or sale of, any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share.  For purposes of this Section 8(a)(i), the  lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Option  shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon granting or sale of the Option, upon exercise of the Option and upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option less any consideration paid or payable by the Company with respect to such one share of Common Stock upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option.  No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such Convertible Securities. 
       (ii)        Issuance of Convertible Securities .   If the Company in any manner issues or sells, or the Company publicly announces the issuance or sale of, any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion or exchange or exercise thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share.  For the purposes of this Section 8(a)(ii), the  lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion or exchange or exercise thereof  shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion or exchange or exercise of such Convertible Security less any consideration paid or payable by the Company with respect to such one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon the conversion or exchange or exercise of such Convertible Security.  No further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 8(a), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. 
     (iii)        Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion . If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exchange or exercise of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold.  For purposes of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Subscription Date are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease.  No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a) shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. 
     (iv)      Calculation of Consideration Received . If any Option and/or Convertible Security is issued in connection with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by such Holder, the   Primary Security  , and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the   Secondary Securities   and together with the Primary Security, each a   Unit  ), together  
 11 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

comprising one integrated transaction (or one or more transactions if such issuances or sales or deemed issuances or sales of securities of the Company either (A) have at least one investor or purchaser in common, (B) are consummated in reasonable proximity to each other and/or (C) are consummated under the same plan of financing), the aggregate consideration per share of Common Stock with respect to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be the lowest of (x) the purchase price of such Unit, (y) if such Primary Security is an Option and/or Convertible Security, the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Primary Security in accordance with Section 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii) above and (z) the lowest Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the three (3) Trading Day period immediately following the public announcement of such Dilutive Issuance (for the avoidance of doubt, if such public announcement is released prior to the opening of the Principal Market on a Trading Day, such Trading Day shall be the first Trading Day in such three (3) Trading Day period).  If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration other than cash received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor.  If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the Closing Sale Price of such publicly traded securities on the date of receipt of such publicly traded securities.  If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be.  The fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the Required Holders.  If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the    Valuation Event   ), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Business Days after the tenth (10   th   ) day following the Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holders.  The determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8(a), if the New Issuance Price calculated pursuant to this Section 8(a)  would result in a price less than $0.0001, the New Issuance Price shall be deemed to be $0.0001.  
 (v)    Record Date . If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 
 (vi)    No Readjustments . For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Conversion Price has been adjusted pursuant to this Section 8(a) and the Dilutive Issuance that triggered such adjustment does not occur, is not consummated, is unwound or is cancelled after the facts for any reason whatsoever, in no event shall the Conversion Price be readjusted to the Conversion Price that would have been in effect if such Dilutive Issuance had not occurred or been consummated. 
     (b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock.  If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced.  If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased.   Any adjustment under this Section 8(b) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.  
     (c) Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 8 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price, as mutually determined by the Company's Board of Directors and the Required Holders, so as to   
 12 
 NY01\AdelM\4309427.8 

protect the rights of such Holder under this Certificate of Designations ; provided, that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 8.  
 (d) Voluntary Adjustment by Company. The Company may at any time any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Required Holders, reduce the then current Conversion Price, the Maturity Automatic Conversion Price, the Automatic Conversion Price and/or the Alternate Conversion Price, as applicable, to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.
