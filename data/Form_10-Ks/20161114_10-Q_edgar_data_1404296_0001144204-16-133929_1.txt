  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

  (unaudited)  

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements (the Financial Statements) and these notes to the Financial Statements (these
Notes) include Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank).
All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The principal activity of the Company
is the ownership of the Bank s common stock, and as such, the terms  Company  and  Bank  are used
interchangeably throughout the Financial Statements and these Notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report) and, unless
context indicates otherwise, refer to the activities of the Company and the Bank. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, and the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP) for interim financial information of smaller reporting companies and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 8 and
Article 9 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for a
complete financial statement presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (all of which are normal and recurring
in nature) considered necessary (i) for a fair presentation and (ii) to make such statements not misleading, have been included. 

Operating results for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016. The audited consolidated financial statements presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 (the 2015 10-K), should be read in conjunction with these Financial Statements. 

Certain items in the prior period financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on net income,
the balance of retained deficit or stockholders  equity as previously reported. 

The preparation of the Financial
Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions based on experience
and available information that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and these Notes, and actual results
could differ materially from these estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for portfolio loan losses (the
allowance), measuring for impairment of troubled debt restructurings (TDR), the fair values of securities, other financial
instruments and other real estate owned (OREO) and the realization of deferred tax assets are particularly susceptible to
material change in the near term. 

Accumulated other comprehensive income consists solely of the effects of unrealized gains and losses on
securities available-for-sale, net of income taxes, which include a disproportionate tax effect of $0.7 million at both September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This disproportionate tax effect is a result of the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance
in June 2015. 

NOTE 2. IMPACT OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

Recently Issued Standards Not Yet Adopted  

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
(ASU 2016-15). The guidance will reduce the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement
of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 provides guidance as to the presentation on the statement of cash flows for eight specific cash flow
issues. The guidance in this standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within
those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements.

NOTE 2. IMPACT OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  (continued) 

Recently Issued Standards Not Yet Adopted
(continued)  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will
measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net
income. The guidance will replace the current  incurred loss  model with an  expected loss  model for
instruments measured at amortized cost. Additionally, the guidance will require allowances for investment securities classified
as available-for-sale, rather than reduce the carrying amount under the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) model. It also
simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired investment securities and loans. The guidance in this standard is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements; however, adoption will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning
of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 reduces complexity in accounting standards
related to the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance in this standard is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02,  Leases  (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on
the balance sheet, as well as to disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements. The guidance in this standard is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers  (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company
to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects
to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers   Deferral of Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. As a result, the guidance in
this standard may be applied using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company
is in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements, as well as evaluating which transition
method it will apply upon adoption.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES  (continued) 

Transactions between Atlantic Coast Bank
and Customers Bank (continued)  

On December 18, 2015, the Bank purchased $44.9
million of multi-family mortgages, comprised entirely of loans in New York and Pennsylvania, from Customers Bank for $45.3 million,
at a premium of 1.00%. Additionally, on September 29, 2015, the Bank purchased $35.7 million of multi-family mortgages, comprised
entirely of loans in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, from Customers Bank for $36.1 million, at a premium of 1.00%. These
loan purchase transactions were made in the ordinary course of the Bank s business, on substantially the same terms as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated business partners and did not involve more than normal risk
or present other unfavorable features. 

On August 26, 2016, the Bank entered into three
amended $15.0 million participation agreements (each was previously $10.0 million) related to warehouse lines of credit secured
by one- to four-family residential loans originated by third party originators under purchase and assumption agreements (warehouse
loans held-for-investment) with Customers Bank (collectively, the Customers Participation Agreements), which were originally entered
into on March 27, 2015 and first amended on March 23, 2016. Under the Customers Participation Agreements, the Bank has an interest
in existing lines of credit related to warehouse loans held-for-investment currently serviced by Customers Bank. 

The Bank receives the full amount of
interest earned on the warehouse loans held-for-investment. Customers Bank receives the fees paid for each individual funding
request. Customers Bank services the warehouse loans held-for-investment funding requests, manages the collateral receipt and
shipment, receives and posts pay downs, and remits principal and interest to the Bank. Under the Customers Participation
Agreements, Customers Bank is required to administer the participating lines of credit using the same standards
the Bank would use to administer its own accounts. Additionally, the Bank has access to each funding request and all daily
activity reporting to monitor its exposure. 

The Customers Participation Agreements were
entered into in the ordinary course of the Bank s business, were made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing
at the time for comparable agreements with non-affiliated business partners and did not involve more than normal risk or present
other unfavorable features. The outstanding balance in warehouse loans held-for-investment related to the Customers Participation
Agreements was $45.0 million as of September 30, 2016, while there was no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank earned $206,000 and $359,000, respectively, of interest income related
to the Customers Participation Agreements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Bank earned $98,000 and
$223,000, respectively, of interest income related to the Customers Participation Agreements. 

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE  

Asset and liability fair value measurements
(in this Note and  Note 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  of these Notes) have been categorized based upon the fair
value hierarchy described below: 

Level
1   Valuation is based upon quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets.  

Level 2   Valuation is based upon
observable inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1, including quoted market prices for similar instruments
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation
techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.    

Level 3   Valuation is generated
from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect
estimates or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Valuation techniques include
use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE  (continued) 

Assets measured at fair value on a recurring
basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are summarized below: 

The fair values of securities available-for-sale
are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities available-for-sale where quoted market prices are
not available, fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities available-for-sale
where quoted market prices or quoted market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted
cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). 

There were no Level 3 investments measured
on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and there were no transfers into or out of Level 3 investments
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015. Discounted cash flows are calculated using
spread to swap and LIBOR curves that are updated to incorporate loss severities, volatility, credit spread and optionality. During
times when trading is less liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research
reports as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations. 

There were no liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE  (continued) 

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are summarized below: 

Quantitative information about Level 3 fair
value measurements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is as follows: 

(1)  The range and weighted average of other appraisal adjustments
and liquidation expenses are presented as a percent of the appraised value. 

(2)  Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral,
which generally include various Level 3 inputs which are not identifiable.   

(3)  Includes qualitative adjustments by management and estimated liquidation expenses.   

(4)  Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions.

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE  (continued) 

The fair value of OREO is determined using
inputs which include current and prior appraisals and estimated costs to sell (Level 3). Assets acquired through or in lieu of
loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure, based on an independent appraisal, less estimated
selling costs establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, the asset value is written down
through expense. Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding of  property are
expensed. There were no write-downs on OREO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. There were no write-downs on
OREO for the three months ended September 30, 2015, while write-downs on OREO for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were
$80,000. The fair values of impaired loans that are collateral-dependent are based on a valuation model which incorporates the
most current real estate appraisals available, as well as assumptions used to estimate the fair value of all non-real estate collateral
as defined in the Bank s internal loan policy (Level 3). 

There were no liabilities measured at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Carrying amount and estimated fair value of
financial instruments, not previously presented, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:

SUBSIDIARY  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (continued)  

  September 30, 2016  

  (unaudited)  

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
(continued) 

Carrying amount is the estimated fair value
for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest, demand and savings deposits and variable rate loans or deposits that re-price
frequently and fully. Fair value of securities held-to-maturity is based on market prices of similar securities. For fixed rate
loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent re-pricing or re-pricing limits, fair value is based
on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life without considering the need for adjustments
for market illiquidity or credit risk. Fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on quoted market prices, where available, or
is determined based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. Carrying
amount is the estimated fair value for warehouse loans held-for-investment, due to the rapid repayment of the loans (generally
less than 30 days). Fair value of bank owned life insurance  is based on the insurance contract cash surrender value or quoted
market prices of the underlying securities or similar securities. Fair value of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and
securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) is based on current rates for similar financing. It was
not practicable to determine the fair value of the FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. The estimated
fair value of other financial instruments and off-balance-sheet commitments approximate cost and are not considered significant
to this presentation. 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB and as such,
is required to maintain a minimum investment in stock of the FHLB that varies with the level of advances outstanding with the FHLB.
The stock is bought from and sold to the FHLB based upon its $100.00 par value. The FHLB has historically redeemed its FHLB stock
at par value. However, the stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and, as such, is classified as restricted stock,
carried at cost and evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the stock s value is determined by the ultimate recoverability
of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines. The determination of whether the par value will ultimately be recovered
is influenced by criteria such as the following: (a) the significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the

The following table summarizes the investment
securities with unrealized losses as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length
of time in a continuous unrealized loss position: 

(1)  The state and municipal unrealized losses as of December 31, 2015, are less than $500 and, therefore,
are rounded to zero in this table.   

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  

Management evaluates investment securities
for OTTI on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company s security portfolio consisted of 20 investment securities (all classified as available-for-sale),
2 of which were in an unrealized loss position. All unrealized losses were related to debt securities whose underlying collateral
is residential mortgages and all of these debt securities were issued by government sponsored organizations, as discussed below. 

As of September 30, 2016, $33.6 million, or
approximately 68.5% of the debt securities held by the Company, including both of the Company s debt securities in an unrealized
loss position, were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are
institutions the U.S. government has affirmed its commitment to support. 

The decline in fair value of the Company s
debt securities in an unrealized loss position was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. It is not
more likely than not the Company will be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery; however, from time
to time the Company makes decisions to sell securities available-for-sale as part of its balance sheet and risk management strategies.
Therefore, the Company does not consider these debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company did not hold any non-agency collateralized
mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and did not record
OTTI related to such securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The 10-year treasury rate as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, was 1.60% and 2.27%, respectively.

Proceeds from Investment Securities  

Proceeds from sales, payments, maturities,
and calls of securities available-for-sale were $35.3 million and $83.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Proceeds from sales, payments, maturities, and calls of securities available-for-sale were $4.1 million and
$11.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Gross gains of $0.5 million and $1.5 million
were realized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. No gross losses were realized during the
three months ended September 30, 2016, while gross losses of $0.2 million were realized during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. The net gain on sale of securities available-for-sale for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes
$0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of accumulated other comprehensive income reclassifications from unrealized holding
gains. No gross gains were realized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. No gross losses were realized during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross losses of $9,000 were realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The net loss on sale of securities available-for-sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, includes $9,000 of accumulated
other comprehensive loss reclassifications from unrealized holding gains. 

On February 18, 2016, the Company sold $15.8
million of investment securities previously classified as held-to-maturity, which were reclassified to available-for-sale as of
December 31, 2015. Therefore, there were no proceeds from payments, maturities, and calls of securities held-to-maturity for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Proceeds from payments, maturities, and calls of securities held-to-maturity were
$0.5 million and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company did not sell any
investment securities classified as held-to-maturity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Gains and losses on sales of investment securities
are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. There were $7.0 million in unsettled
investment securities transactions at September 30, 2016, while there were no unsettled investment securities transactions at December
31, 2015.

The Company utilizes an internal asset classification
system for multi-family, commercial and land portfolio loans as a means of reporting problem and potential problem loans. Under
the risk rating system, the Company classifies problem and potential problem loans as  Special Mention ,  Substandard 
or  Doubtful , which correspond to risk ratings five, six and seven, respectively. Portfolio loans that do not currently
expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses
that deserve management s close attention are deemed to be Special Mention, or risk rated five. Substandard portfolio loans,
or risk rated six, include those characterized by the distinct possibility the Company may sustain some loss if the deficiencies
are not corrected. Portfolio loans classified as Doubtful, or risk rated seven, have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified
Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently
existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Generally, the Company reviews all revolving credit
relationships, regardless of amount, and any other loan relationship in excess of $500,000 on an annual basis. However, risk ratings
are updated any time the facts and circumstances warrant. 

The Company evaluates residential and consumer
portfolio loans based on whether the loans are performing or nonperforming, as well as other factors. Residential loans are charged
down by the expected loss amount at the time they become nonperforming, which is generally 90 days past due. Consumer loans, including
automobile, manufactured housing, unsecured, and other secured loans are charged-off, net of expected recovery, when the loan becomes
significantly past due over a range of up to 180 days, depending on the type of loan.

of multi-family, commercial and land portfolio loans evaluated by internal asset classification as of September 30, 2016 and December

NOTE 7. PORTFOLIO LOANS  (continued) 

When establishing the allowance, management
categorizes loans into risk categories generally based on the nature of the collateral and basis of repayment. These risk categories
and the relevant risk characteristics are as follows: 

Real Estate Loans  

One- to four-family residential loans
have historically had less credit risk than other loan types as they tend to be smaller balance loans without concentrations to
a single borrower or group of borrowers. Repayment depends on the individual borrower s capacity. If the real estate market
deteriorates and the value of residential real estate declines, there is a potential risk of loss if actions such as foreclosure
or short sale become necessary to collect the loan and private mortgage insurance was not purchased. In addition, depending on
the state in which the collateral is located, the risk of loss may increase, due to the time required to complete the foreclosure
process on a property.    

Multi-family residential real estate loans
generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential real estate loans, but are normally smaller individual loan
balances than commercial real estate loans. Multi-family residential real estate loans involve a greater degree of credit risk
as compared to residential real estate loans due to the reliance on the successful operation of the project. These loans are also
more sensitive to adverse economic conditions.    

Commercial real estate loans generally
have greater credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans, as they usually involve larger loan
balances secured by non-homogeneous or specific use properties. Repayment of these loans typically relies on the continued successful
operation of a business or the generation of lease income by the property and is therefore more sensitive to adverse conditions
in the economy and real estate market.    

Land loans generally involve a greater
degree of credit risk as compared to residential real estate loans due to the lack of cash flow and reliance on the borrower s
financial capacity. These loans are also more sensitive to adverse economic conditions.    

Real Estate Construction Loans  

Real estate construction loans, including
one- to four-family, commercial and acquisition and development loans, generally have greater credit risk than traditional one-
to four-family residential and commercial real estate loans. The repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property
to third parties or the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user. In the event a loan is made
on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed.
Construction loans also run the risk that improvements will not be completed on time or in accordance with specifications and projected
costs. Construction loans include Small Business Administration (SBA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) construction loans,
which generally have less credit risk than traditional construction loans due to a portion of the balance being guaranteed upon
completion of the construction.    

Other Portfolio Loans  

Home equity loans and home equity lines
of credit are similar to one- to four-family residential loans and generally carry less risk than other loan types as they tend
to be smaller balance loans without concentrations to a single borrower or group of borrowers. However, similar to one- to four-family
residential loans, there is a potential risk of loss if the real estate market deteriorates and the value of residential real estate
declines.

Consumer loans often are secured by depreciating
collateral, including automobiles and mobile homes, or are unsecured and may carry more risk than real estate secured loans. Consumer
loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely
affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy.    

Commercial loans are secured by business
assets or may be unsecured, and repayment is directly dependent on the continued successful operation of the borrower s business
and ability to convert the assets to operating revenue. These possess greater risk than most other types of loans should the repayment
capacity of the borrower not be adequate.

Portfolio loans for which concessions have
been granted as a result of the borrower s financial difficulties are considered a TDR. These concessions, which in general
are applied to all categories of portfolio loans, may include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions,
forgiveness of principal, or a combination of these or other actions intended to maximize collection. The resulting TDR impairment
is included in specific reserves. 

For homogeneous loan categories, such as one-
to four-family residential loans and home equity loans, the amount of impairment resulting from the modification of the loan terms
is calculated in aggregate by category of portfolio loan. The resulting impairment is included in specific reserves. If an individual
homogeneous loan defaults under terms of the TDR and becomes nonperforming, the Bank follows its usual practice of charging the
loan down to its estimated fair value and the charge-off is considered as a factor in determining the amount of the general component
of the allowance. 

For larger non-homogeneous loans, each loan
that is modified is evaluated individually for impairment based on either discounted cash flow or, for collateral-dependent loans,
the appraised value of the collateral less selling costs. If the loan is not collateral-dependent, the amount of the impairment,
if any, is recorded as a specific reserve in the allowance. If the loan is collateral-dependent, the amount of the impairment is
charged off. There was an allocated allowance for TDRs individually evaluated for impairment of approximately $0.3 million at both
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Portfolio loans modified as TDRs with market
rates of interest are classified as impaired portfolio loans. Once the TDR  has performed for 12 months in accordance with
the modified terms it is classified as a performing impaired loan. TDRs which do not perform in accordance with modified terms
are reported as nonperforming portfolio loans. The policy for returning a nonperforming loan to accrual status is the same for
any loan irrespective of whether the loan has been modified. As such, loans which are nonperforming prior to modification continue
to be accounted for as nonperforming loans (and are reported as impaired nonperforming loans) until they have demonstrated the
ability to maintain sustained performance over a period of time, but no less than six months. Following this period such a modified
loan is returned to accrual status and is classified as impaired and reported as a performing TDR. TDRs classified as impaired
loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:

The TDR balances included performing TDRs of
$20.2 million and $30.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There were no commitments to lend
additional amounts on TDRs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Bank is proactive in modifying residential,
home equity and consumer loans in early stage delinquency because management believes modifying the loan prior to it becoming nonperforming
results in the least cost to the Bank. The Bank also modifies commercial real estate and other large commercial loans as TDRs rather
than pursuing other means of collection when it believes the borrower is committed to the successful repayment of the loan and
the business operations are likely to support the modified loan terms. 

The following table presents information on
TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

All of the Company s portfolio loans
that were restructured as TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, resulted in modifications to either rate,
term, amortization or balance. Such modifications are only granted to borrowers who have demonstrated the capacity to repay under
the modified terms. 

There were two subsequent defaults on portfolio
loans that were restructured as TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The subsequent defaults included one commercial
real estate loan with a recorded investment of $2.0 million, and one land loan with a recorded investment of $5.5 million. There
were no subsequent defaults on portfolio loans that were restructured as TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The Company originates mortgage loans held-for-sale with the intent to sell the loans and the servicing rights to investors. The
Company originates SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale with the intent to sell the guaranteed portion of the loans to investors, while
maintaining the servicing rights. The Company originates warehouse loans held-for-investment and permits third-party originators
to sell the loans and servicing rights to investors in order to repay the warehouse balance outstanding. 

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company internally originated approximately $25.0 million and $61.0 million of mortgage loans held-for-sale, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company internally originated approximately $2.5 million and $6.0
million of mortgage loans held-for-sale, respectively. The gain recorded on sale of mortgage loans held-for-sale, during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The gain recorded on sale of mortgage
loans held-for-sale, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. 

During the three  months ended September

During the three and nine months ended September

through third parties. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company originated approximately $311.7 million
and $872.7 million, respectively, of warehouse loans held-for-investment through third parties. Loan sales under the warehouse
loans held-for-investment lending program, which are done at par, earned interest on outstanding balances of $0.8 million and $1.8
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These loan sales also earned interest on outstanding
balances of $0.6 million and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The weighted average
number of days outstanding of warehouse loans held-for-investment was 12 days and 13 days for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, and 16 and 18 days for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the balance in warehouse loans held-for-investment did not include any past due, nonperforming, classified, restructured, or impaired
loans. Warehouse loans held-for-investment possess less risk than other types of loans as they are secured by one- to four-family
residential loans which tend to be smaller balance loans without concentrations to a single borrower or group of borrowers. Due
to the generally short duration of time warehouse loans held-for-investment are outstanding, the collateral arrangements related
to warehouse loans held-for-investment and other factors, management has determined that no allowance for loan losses is necessary. 

NOTE 9. SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS
TO REPURCHASE  

The Company had no outstanding balance on repurchase
agreements as of September 30, 2016, and repurchase agreements with a carrying amount of $10.0 million as of December 31, 2015.
Information concerning repurchase agreements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December
31, 2015, is summarized as follows: 

On June 22, 2015, the Company prepaid $56.3
million of repurchase agreements, representing the entire outstanding balance of repurchase agreements as of such date. Under the
terms of the repurchase agreements, any prepayment prior to maturity would result in a prepayment penalty equal to the amount that
the fair value exceeded the book value. As such, the Company paid $5.2 million in prepayment penalties. 

On June 26, 2015, the Company entered into
a $10.0 million short-term variable rate repurchase agreement. Under the terms of this repurchase agreement, the instrument did
not have a stated maturity date and would continue until terminated by either the Company or the counterparty. Additionally, the
collateral required to be pledged by the Company was subject to an adjustment determined by the counterparty and was required to
be pledged in amounts equal to the debt plus the adjustment. On July 1, 2015, the Company paid off $10.0 million of repurchase
agreements, representing the entire outstanding balance of repurchase agreements as of such date. There was no penalty associated
with the pay-off.

NOTE 9. SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS
TO REPURCHASE  (continued) 

On December 29, 2015, the Company entered into
a $10.0 million short-term variable rate repurchase agreement. Under the terms of this repurchase agreement, the instrument did
not have a stated maturity date and would continue until terminated by either the Company or the counterparty. Additionally, the
collateral required to be pledged by the Company was subject to an adjustment determined by the counterparty and was required to
be pledged in amounts equal to the debt plus the adjustment. On January 4, 2016, the Company paid off $10.0 million of repurchase
agreements, representing the entire outstanding balance of repurchase agreements as of such date. There was no penalty associated
with the pay-off. 

The Company had no investment securities
posted as collateral under this new repurchase agreement as of September 30, 2016, while $10.1 million in investment securities
were posted as collateral under this new repurchase agreement as of December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 10. FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
advances from the FHLB were as follows: 

(1)  As a result of the prepayment and restructure of three advances, totaling $50.0 million, on June
22, 2015, $3.5 million in aggregate of deferred prepayment penalties were factored into the new interest rate of such three advances.   

The FHLB advances had a weighted-average maturity
of 24 months and a weighted-average rate of 1.14% at September 30, 2016. The Company had $366.3 million in portfolio loans posted
as collateral for these advances as of September 30, 2016. 

The Bank s remaining borrowing capacity
with the FHLB was $45.9 million at September 30, 2016. The FHLB requires that the Bank collateralize the excess of the fair value
of the FHLB advances over the book value with cash and investment securities. In the event the Bank prepays advances prior to maturity,
it must do so at the fair value of such FHLB advances. As of September 30, 2016, fair value exceeded the book value of the individual
advances by $2.6 million, which was collateralized by portfolio loans (included in the $366.3 million discussed above). The Bank
intends to supplement its loan collateral with investment securities as needed to secure the FHLB borrowings or prepay advances
to reduce the amount of collateral required to secure the debt. Unpledged investment securities available for collateral amounted
to $44.7 million as of September 30, 2016.

NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES  

Income tax expense for the nine months ending
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

The Company considers at each reporting period
all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance
is needed to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. A determination of the need
for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is dependent upon management s evaluation of both positive and negative
evidence. 

The Company did not have a valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016. The Company s valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets
was $0.1 million as of December 31, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company used $4.2 million of federal net operating loss carryover and $2.6 million of state net operating loss carryover.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not use any federal net operating loss carryover or state net
operating loss carryover. 

Under the rules of Internal Revenue Code section
382 (IRC   382), a change in the ownership of the Company occurred during the first quarter of 2013. During the second quarter
of 2013, the Company became aware of the change in ownership based on applicable filings made by stockholders with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC). In accordance with IRC   382, the Company determined the gross amount of net operating
loss carryover that it could utilize was limited to approximately $325,000 per year, excluding any net operating loss carryover
generated after the first quarter of 2013. 

The Company has a federal net operating loss
carryover of $5.5 million which begins to expire in 2019. There is no valuation allowance on this carryover. The Company has a
state net operating loss carryover of $5.5 million which begins to expire in 2018. There is no valuation allowance on this carryover. 

NOTE 12. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  

Basic earnings per common share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding for the period.
The basic weighted average common shares and common stock equivalents are computed using the treasury stock method. The basic weighted
average common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding for the period is adjusted for average unallocated employee stock
ownership plan shares, average director s deferred compensation shares and average unearned restricted stock awards. 

Diluted earnings per common share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding for the period
increased for the dilutive effect of unvested stock options and stock awards. The dilutive effect of the unvested stock options
and stock awards is calculated under the treasury stock method utilizing the average market value of the Company s stock
for the period.

NOTE 12. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  (continued) 

The following table summarizes the basic and
diluted earnings per common share computation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, all of the Company s stock options and stock awards were antidilutive and, therefore, were excluded from
the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. 

NOTE 13. REGULATORY SUPERVISION  

The Bank s actual and required capital
levels and ratios as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:

NOTE 13. REGULATORY SUPERVISION  (continued) 

The Bank s capital classification under
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) defined levels as of September 30, 2016, was well-capitalized. 

Beginning on January 1, 2016, as a result of
the commencement of the phase-in of amended regulatory risk-based capital rules, the Company must maintain a capital conservation
buffer to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. The capital conservation buffer must consist
solely of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, but it applies to all three risk-weighted measurements (total risk based capital to risk-weighted
assets ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio) in addition
to the minimum risk-weighted capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer required for 2016 is common equity equal to
0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by 0.625% per year until reaching 2.5% beginning January 1, 2019. 

On March 26, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (the OCC), the Bank s primary regulator, reclassified the Bank as a well-capitalized institution and terminated
the Consent Order, dated August 10, 2012 (the Order), between the OCC and the Bank, which restricted the activities of the Bank
in various ways, as previously disclosed. 

On July 17, 2015, the Company received written
notice of termination of the Supervisory Agreement initiated on December 10, 2010 (the Supervisory Agreement), between the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) and the Company. Prior to the termination, the Supervisory Agreement restricted
the activities of the Company in various ways, as previously disclosed. The notice of termination, dated July 15, 2015, was received
from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on behalf of the FRB and stated the Company is no longer considered to be in  troubled
condition  for savings and loan holding company regulatory purposes. 

NOTE 14. BRANCH TRANSACTION  

On November 20, 2015, the Bank announced it
had agreed to sell its branch in Garden City, Georgia (the Garden City branch) to Queensborough National Bank   Trust Company
(Queensborough), headquartered in Louisville, Georgia. In the transaction, which closed on April 8, 2016, Queensborough acquired
certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Bank. The Garden City branch sale, which did not have a material impact on
the Company's assets, loan portfolio or earnings, resulted in $13.7 million of deposits, or approximately 2.5% of the Bank s
total deposits as of March 31, 2016, transferring to Queensborough. The Company recorded a $0.1 million gain on the transaction.

General Description of Business 

The Company and the Bank have traditionally
focused on attracting deposits and investing those funds primarily in loans, including commercial real estate loans, consumer loans,
first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences and home equity loans. Additionally, the Bank invests funds in
multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, and commercial and residential construction loans. The Bank also invests
funds in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies or entities, including Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. 

Revenues are derived principally from interest
on loans and other interest-earning assets, such as investment securities. To a lesser extent, revenue is generated from service
charges, gains on the sale of loans and other income. 

The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts
having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings
and money market demand, and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from three months to five years. Deposits are primarily solicited
in the Bank s market areas of the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia to fund loan demand and other liquidity needs;
however, late in 2015 the Bank also started soliciting deposits in Central Florida. 

Recent Events 

Garden City, Georgia Branch Transaction  

On November 20, 2015, the Bank announced
it agreed to sell its branch in Garden City, Georgia (the Garden City branch) to Queensborough National Bank   Trust Company
(Queensborough), headquartered in Louisville, Georgia. In the transaction, which closed on April 8, 2016, Queensborough acquired
certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Bank. The Garden City branch sale, which did not have a material impact on
the Company's assets, loan portfolio or earnings, resulted in $13.7 million of deposits, or approximately 2.5% of the Bank s
total deposits as of March 31, 2016, transferring to Queensborough. The Company recorded a $0.1 million gain on the transaction. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Certain accounting policies
are important to the presentation of the Company s financial condition, because they require management to make difficult,
complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these
policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances, including, without limitation,
changes in interest rates, performance of the economy, financial condition of borrowers, and laws and regulations. Management believes
that its critical accounting policies include: (i) determining the allowance for portfolio loan losses (the allowance) and the
provision for portfolio loan losses (provision expense); (ii) measuring for impairment in troubled debt restructurings (TDR); (iii)
determining the fair value of investment securities; (iv) determining the fair value of other real estate owned (OREO); and (v)
accounting for deferred income taxes. 

There have been no material
updates to these accounting policies or estimates affected by these accounting policies during the first nine months of 2016. For
additional discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the  Critical Accounting Policies  discussion
in  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the 2015 10-K. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  

General  

Total assets increased $79.7 million, or
9.3%, to $936.9 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $857.2 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in assets was funded
primarily by increases in deposits of $61.7 million, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances of $22.4 million, and stockholders 
equity of $5.4 million, as discussed below, partially offset by the reduction of $10.0 million in securities sold under agreements
to repurchase (repurchase agreements). Net portfolio loans increased $43.1 million, other loans increased $77.0 million, and cash
and cash equivalents increased $26.3 million, while investment securities decreased $71.1 million. Total deposits increased $61.7
million, or 11.1%, to $617.5 million at September 30, 2016, from $555.8 million at December 31, 2015. Noninterest-bearing demand
accounts increased $9.4 million, interest-bearing demand accounts increased by $5.7 million, savings and money market accounts
increased $39.0 million, and time deposits increased by $7.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Total borrowings
increased by $12.4 million to $229.9 million at September 30, 2016, from $217.5 million at December 31, 2015, due to the aforementioned
increase in FHLB advances in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by the aforementioned reduction in repurchase agreements
during the same period. Stockholders  equity increased by $5.4 million to $86.1 million at September 30, 2016, from $80.7
million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to net income of $4.4 million and other comprehensive income of $0.9 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Following are the summarized comparative
balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents increased $26.3
million to $49.9 million at September 30, 2016, from $23.6 million at December 31, 2015. The Bank has increased its liquidity and
contingent liquidity capacity and sources to meet potential funding requirements, including availability from the FHLB, the Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta and other private institutional sources to fund the origination of loans and pay-off liabilities. 

Investment Securities  

Investment securities are comprised primarily
of debt securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities. The investment portfolio decreased
$71.1 million to $49.0 million at September 30, 2016, from $120.1 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the sale of investment
securities during 2016, as the market provided an opportunity to sell certain investment securities, which had low fixed-rate yields,
at a net gain. These strategic sales of investment securities have helped the Company neutralize its interest rate sensitivity
in a rising-rate environment. The impact of these transactions were partially offset by the purchase of $10.0 million of investment
securities during the first nine months of 2016, while the remaining proceeds were used to fund loan growth. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, all of the $49.0 million and $120.1 million, respectively, of investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. 

As of September 30, 2016, no investment
securities were pledged as collateral for the repurchase agreements or FHLB advances. Additionally, $33.6 million, or 68.5%, of
the debt securities held by the Company as of September 30, 2016, were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies,
primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are institutions the U.S. government has affirmed its commitment to support. 

Portfolio Loans  

Below is a comparative composition of net
portfolio loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, excluding loans held-for-sale and warehouse lines of credit secured
by one- to four-family residential loans originated by third party originators under purchase and assumption agreements (warehouse
loans held-for-investment): 

Total portfolio loans (excluding the allowance,
deferred costs, and premiums and discounts) increased $44.0 million, or 7.3%, to $647.3 million at September 30, 2016, as compared
to $603.3 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to originations of $29.5 million of one- to four-family residential mortgages
and $40.3 million of commercial real estate loans, as well as the purchase of $7.1 million of commercial real estate loans, partially
offset by the sale of $31.3 million of one- to four-family residential mortgages and principal amortization and increased prepayments
of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase
in prepayments on one- to four-family residential mortgages is consistent with the current low interest rate environment. 

Total portfolio loans growth was also partially
offset by gross loan charge-offs of $0.8 million and transfers to OREO of nonperforming loans of $0.1 million during the first
nine months of 2016. 

Small Business Administration (SBA) and
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans originated internally and held-for-sale (SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale), SBA and USDA
portfolio loans and other portfolio loans to small businesses are included in the commercial category of other portfolio loans.
The Company sells the guaranteed portion of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale upon completion of loan funding and approval by the SBA
or USDA, as applicable. The unguaranteed portion of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale, which remains in the Company s portfolio
in commercial other loans, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $6.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively. The Company
plans to expand this business line going forward. 

Growth in mortgage origination, the SBA/USDA
portfolio and other commercial business loan production is expected to exceed principal amortization and loan pay-offs in the near
future, but we can give no assurances. 

The composition of the Bank s portfolio
loans is weighted toward one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2016, first mortgages (including residential
construction loans) and home equity loans totaled $337.0 million, or 52.1% of total portfolio loans. Approximately $23.4 million,
or 60.8%, of loans recorded as home equity loans and $322.0 million, or 95.5%, of loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential
properties were in a first lien position as of September 30, 2016. 

The composition of first mortgages and
home equity loans by state as of September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

Allowance for Portfolio Loan Losses  

The allowance was $8.2 million, or 1.24%
of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to $7.7 million, or 1.27% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2015. 

The activity in the allowance for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

Net charge-offs during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a $74,000 increase in net charge-offs
in commercial real estate loans, a $57,000 increase in net charge-offs in consumer auto loans, a $54,000 increase in net charge-offs
in manufactured home loans, and a $54,000 increase in net charge-offs in commercial business loans, partially offset by a $108,000
decrease in net charge-offs in one- to four-family residential and home equity loans and a $57,000 decrease in net charge-offs
in unsecured consumer loans. 

Below is a comparative composition of nonperforming
assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Nonperforming loans were $10.9 million,
or 1.66% of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2016, as compared to $4.2 million, or 0.69% of total portfolio loans, at December
31, 2015. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily due to two performing loans, totaling $7.5 million, becoming nonperforming,
partially offset by the transfer of $0.1 million in nonperforming loans to OREO and principal reductions and loan pay-offs of existing
nonperforming loans. The two loans which became nonperforming were originated prior to the 2008 credit crisis, were excluded from
the bulk sale in 2013, and were already classified as TDRs; however, both loans are carried below their respective collateral fair
values and we do not anticipate any additional losses in resolving them. 

The current market for disposing of nonperforming
assets is active, and these types of transactions may result in additional losses over the amounts provided for in the allowance.
However, the Company continues to monitor and attempt to reduce nonperforming assets through the least costly means. The allowance
is determined by the information available at the time such determination is made and reflects management s estimate of loss. 

As of September 30, 2016, total nonperforming
one- to four-family residential and home equity loans of $2.3 million was derived from $2.9 million in contractual balances that
had been written-down to the estimated fair value of their collateral, less estimated selling costs, at the date the applicable
loan was classified as nonperforming. Further declines in the fair value of the collateral, or a decision to sell such loans as
distressed assets, could result in additional losses. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all nonperforming loans were
classified as nonaccrual and there were no loans 90 days past due and accruing interest. 

OREO was $2.8 million and $3.2 million
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as the Company had sales of OREO of $0.6 million during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, which was partially offset by transfers from nonperforming loans into OREO of $0.1 million during the
same period. The Company did not have any writedowns of OREO during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The OREO balances
at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, included a commercial real estate property, representing the majority of each
balance. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance of such commercial real estate property was $2.5 million.
The Company recorded losses on foreclosed assets of $254,000 and $118,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Impaired Loans  

The following table shows impaired loans
segregated by performing and nonperforming status and the associated allowance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

____________ 

Impaired loans include large, non-homogeneous
loans where it is probable that the Bank will not receive all principal and interest when contractually due. Impaired loans also
include TDRs, which totaled $35.0 million as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $35.0 million at December 31, 2015. A portfolio
loan that is modified as a TDR with a market rate of interest is classified as an impaired loan and reported as a nonperforming
TDR in the year of restructure and until the loan has performed for 12 months in accordance with the modified terms. At September
30, 2016, approximately $20.2 million of restructured loans, previously disclosed as being impaired and nonperforming TDRs, have
demonstrated 12 months of performance under restructured terms and are reported as performing TDRs in this Report. The Company s
performing TDRs are still considered impaired. 

Other Loans  

Other loans was comprised of loans secured
by one- to four-family residential homes originated internally (mortgage loans held-for-sale), SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale and
warehouse loans held-for-investment. 

The following table shows other loans,
segregated by held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Other loans increased $77.0 million, or
152.0%, to $127.7 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $50.7 million at December 31, 2015, due to an increase in both
originations of mortgage loans held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment. The increase in mortgage loans held-for-sale
was primarily due to our overall balance sheet strategy, which currently emphasizes originating certain loans, such as mortgages,
to be sold, rather than to be held in our portfolio. The increase in warehouse loans held-for-investment was primarily due to expanded
relationships with current counterparties, as well as relationships with new counterparties. 

The Company internally originated $61.0
million and sold $53.5 million of mortgage loans held-for-sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company internally
originated $6.0 million and sold $7.2 million of mortgage loans held-for-sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The gain recorded on sales of mortgage loans held-for-sale during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was $0.8 million and $0.5
million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company internally originated $4.7 million and sold
$7.1 million of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale compared to originations of $3.2 million and sales of $6.3 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The gain recorded on sales and servicing of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale during the first nine
months of 2016 and 2015 was $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Bank plans to expand its held-for-sale business lines
going forward. 

Loans originated and sold under the Company s
warehouse loans held-for-investment lending program were $1,210.8 million and $1,135.3 million, respectively, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to originations and sales of $872.7 million and $856.2 million, respectively, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Loan sales under the warehouse loans held-for-investment lending program, which are done at par,
earned interest on outstanding balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, of $1.8 million and $1.5 million,
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the weighted average number of days outstanding of warehouse loans
held-for-investment was 13 days. Due to the favorable interest rate environment, we expect that production of warehouse loans held-for-investment
will continue to be a strategic focus of the Bank. 

Deferred Income Taxes  

Despite the Company being in a three-year
cumulative loss position as of June 30, 2015, based on the assessment during the second quarter of 2015 of this fact and all the
other positive and negative evidence bearing on the likelihood of realization of the Company s deferred tax assets, management
concluded it is more likely than not that $8.5 million of the deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of future tax benefits associated
with the allowance for portfolio loan losses, net operating loss carryover and net unrealized loss on securities available-for-sale,
will be realized based upon future taxable income. Therefore, $8.5 million of the valuation allowance was reversed during the second
quarter of 2015. There was no valuation allowance as of September 30, 2016, while there was a valuation allowance of $0.1 million
as of December 31, 2015. The future realization of the Company s net operating loss carryovers is limited to $325,000 per
year, excluding net operating loss carryovers of $0.6 million, which were generated after the first quarter of 2013. The Company
expects that the net operating loss carryovers generated after the first quarter of 2013 will be fully used in 2016. 

Deposits  

Total deposits were $617.5 million at September
30, 2016, an increase of $61.7 million from $555.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was comprised of an increase of $54.1
million in non-maturing deposits and an increase of $7.6 million in time deposits. Additionally, the Company sold $13.7 million
of deposits to Queensborough during the second quarter of 2016, as discussed in  Recent Events  above in this MD A. 

Non-maturing deposits increased to $378.1
million at September 30, 2016, due to a $9.4 million increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, a $5.7 million increase in
interest-bearing demand deposits and a $39.0 million increase in savings and money market deposits. The increase in non-maturing
deposits was due to our continued development of commercial relationships. Time deposits increased to $239.3 million as of September
30, 2016, due to an increase of $16.3 million in deposits related to a retail certificates of deposit promotion and an increase
of $7.0 million in brokered deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $13.1 million in our standard certificates of deposit and
a decrease of $2.6 million in non-brokered Internet certificates of deposit. 

Management believes near
term deposit growth will be moderate with an emphasis on core deposit growth. The Bank expects to continue to supplement its core
deposit growth, if needed, with strategic retail certificates of deposit promotions, certificates of deposit sourced through a
well-known national non-broker Internet deposit program, which has been successfully utilized in the past, brokered deposits or
the creation of new business deposit products. Significant changes in the short-term interest rate environment could affect the
availability of deposits in the markets we serve and, therefore, may cause the Bank to change its strategy. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to
Repurchase  

The Company had no outstanding balance
on repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2016, and repurchase agreements with a carrying amount of $10.0 million as of December
31, 2015. Information concerning repurchase agreements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended
December 31, 2015, is summarized as follows: 

On December 29, 2015, the Company entered
into a $10.0 million short-term variable rate repurchase agreement. Under the terms of this repurchase agreement, the instrument
did not have a stated maturity date and would continue until terminated by either the Company or the counterparty. Additionally,
the collateral required to be pledged by the Company was subject to an adjustment determined by the counterparty and was required
to be pledged in amounts equal to the debt plus the adjustment. On January 4, 2016, the Company paid off $10.0 million of repurchase
agreements, representing the entire outstanding balance of repurchase agreements as of such date. There was no penalty associated
with the pay-off. 

The Company had no in investment securities
posted as collateral under this new repurchase agreement as of September 30, 2016, while $10.1 million in investment securities
were posted as collateral under this new repurchase agreement as of December 31, 2015. 

Federal Home Loan
Bank Advances  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, advances from the FHLB were as follows: 

____________ 

(1)  As a result of the prepayment and restructure of three advances, totaling $50.0 million, on June
22, 2015, $3.5 million in aggregate of deferred prepayment penalties were factored into the new interest rate of such three advances.   

The FHLB advances had a weighted-average
maturity of 24 months and a weighted-average rate of 1.14% at September 30, 2016. The Company had $366.3 million in portfolio loans
posted as collateral for these advances as of September 30, 2016. 

The Bank s remaining borrowing capacity
with the FHLB was $45.9 million at September 30, 2016. The FHLB requires that the Bank collateralize the excess of the fair value
of the FHLB advances over the book value with cash and investment securities. In the event the Bank prepays advances prior to maturity,
it must do so at the fair value of such FHLB advances. As of September 30, 2016, fair value exceeded the book value of the individual
advances by $2.6 million, which was collateralized by portfolio loans (included in the $366.3 million discussed above). The Bank
intends to supplement its loan collateral with investment securities as needed to secure the FHLB borrowings or prepay advances
to reduce the amount of collateral required to secure the debt. Unpledged investment securities available for collateral amounted
to $44.7 million as of September 30, 2016. 

See  Liquidity  discussion
below in this MD A for further information regarding the Company s FHLB advances, as well as information regarding the
Company s other liquidity sources. 

Stockholders 
Equity  

Stockholders  equity increased by
$5.4 million to $86.1 million at September 30, 2016, from $80.7 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to net income of $4.4
million and other comprehensive income of $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The other comprehensive income
during the first nine months of 2016, which reduced the Company s accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 30,
2016, was primarily due to the sale of investment securities during 2016, as well as a positive change in the fair value of investment
securities as interest rates decreased during the first nine months of 2016. 

The Company s equity to assets ratio
decreased to 9.2% at September 30, 2016, from 9.4% at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s total risk
based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 13.42%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 12.21%,
Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 12.21% and Tier 1 capital to adjusted assets ratio was 9.09%. These ratios as
of December 31, 2015, were 13.91%, 12.66%, 12.66% and 9.49%, respectively. The decrease in capital ratios as of September 30, 2016,
compared with those as of December 31, 2015, was primarily due to growth in the Bank's balance sheet, especially with respect to
portfolio loans, which resulted in an increase in risk-weighted assets and adjusted total assets, partially offset by an increase
in capital. The Bank expects to continue to shift its asset base to higher interest-earning loans with higher risk weighting. The
Bank s capital classification under Prompt Corrective Action defined levels as of September 30, 2016, was well-capitalized. 

The Company continues to monitor strategies
to preserve capital including the continued suspension of cash dividends and its stock repurchase program. Resumption of these
programs is not expected to occur in the near term. 

Comparison of Results of Operations
for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General  

Net income for the three months ended September
30, 2016, was $1.5 million, as compared to net income of $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s
return on assets ratio and return on equity ratio (both annualized) were 0.68% and 7.19%, respectively, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared with 0.51% and 5.04%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased $0.5 million as compared to net income in the same period in 2015, primarily
due to an increase in net interest income of $1.0 million and an increase in noninterest income of $0.4 million, partially offset
by an increase in noninterest expense of $0.5 million and an increase in income tax expense of $0.4 million. Net interest income
increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the impact
of increased portfolio loans and other loans outstanding and decreased interest expense for FHLB advances, partially offset by
lower interest rates on portfolio loans, the impact of lower balances in investment securities and increased interest expense on
deposits. Noninterest income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015,
primarily due to higher gains on the sale of investment securities and the income from a forfeited escrow account related to an
OREO sale in 2015 (included in Other noninterest income), partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale.
Noninterest expense increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015, primarily due to increased incentive compensation costs associated with the Company's continuing growth strategies and
increased technology costs. 

Average Balances,
Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid  

The following table sets
forth certain information for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The average yields and costs are derived by dividing
income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. 

____________ 

(1)  Includes portfolio loans and other loans. Calculated net of deferred loan fees. Nonaccrual loans
included as loans carrying a zero yield.   

(2)  Calculated based on carrying value. State and municipal investment securities yields have not been
adjusted to full tax equivalents, as the numbers would not change materially from those presented in the table.   

(3)  Includes FHLB stock at cost and term deposits with other financial institutions.   

(4)  Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.   

Rate/Volume Analysis  

The following table presents
the dollar amount of changes in interest income for major components of interest-earning assets and in interest expense for major
components of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes
attributable to (1) changes in volume multiplied by the old interest rate; (2) changes in interest rate multiplied by the old volume;
and (3) changes not solely attributable to interest rate or volume, which have been allocated proportionately to the change due
to volume and the change due to interest rate. 

____________ 

(1)  Includes portfolio loans and other loans. Calculated net of deferred loan fees. Nonaccrual loans
included as loans carrying a zero yield.   

Loan growth and lower
average rates paid on borrowed funds have driven the increase in net interest income, partially offset by lower average loan rates
and an increase in borrowed funds and interest-bearing deposits. 

Interest Income  

Total interest income
increased $0.8 million to $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $7.7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, due to the impact of higher balances in portfolio loans and other loans outstanding, partially
offset by the decrease in interest rates on portfolio loans and lower balances in investment securities. Interest income on loans
increased to $8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $6.9 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of loans, which increased $188.1 million to $750.2 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $562.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset
by a decrease in average yield on loans of 68 basis points to 4.24% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The average balance of
loans increased due to an increase in portfolio loans and other loans outstanding. Originations of portfolio loans increased during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in increased interest income on portfolio loans outstanding and additional
fee income. Originations of warehouse loans held-for-investment increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016, partially
offset by a decrease in the weighted average number of days outstanding for warehouse loans held-for-investment during the same
period, resulting in increased interest income and additional fee income. The increase in originations of warehouse loans held-for-investment
is the result of an increase in home purchase and refinance volume, and increased volume related to our expanded relationships
with current counterparties, as well as relationships with new counterparties. 

Interest income earned
on investment securities decreased $0.3 million to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.7 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $56.2 million in the average balance
of investment securities to $70.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense
declined by $0.3 million to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.9 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, due to the decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances, partially offset by increased
interest expenses on deposits. The increase in interest expense on deposits in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the
third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to higher average rates paid on deposits and an increase in the average balance in
such deposits. The average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, increased 13 basis points to 0.64% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 0.51% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
in interest expense on FHLB advances for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015, was primarily due to lower average rates paid on FHLB advances resulting from the Bank s aggressive
strategies to manage interest rates, which were partially offset by an increase in the average balance of such advances. 

The Bank s overall
cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 0.79% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, down from 1.04%
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to lower interest rates on FHLB advances and increased noninterest-bearing
deposits, partially offset by higher average balances in FHLB advances and an increase in the average rates paid on deposits and
in the average balance in such deposits. 

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income increased
$1.0 million to $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $5.8 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, due to the increase in portfolio loans and other loans outstanding and decreased interest expense for FHLB advances,
partially offset by lower interest rates on portfolio loans, the impact of lower balances in investment securities and lower interest
rates on funds invested in investment securities, as well as an increase in interest expense on deposits. 

Our net interest rate
spread, which is the difference between the interest rate earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest-bearing
liabilities, decreased 7 basis points to 3.09% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.16% for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Our net interest margin, which is net interest income expressed as a percentage of our average
interest-earning assets, decreased 5 basis points to 3.19% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.24%
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The slight decrease in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin primarily
reflected the negative impact on interest income from declining interest rates on portfolio loans, partially offset by the positive
impact on interest income from increasing balances in portfolio loans and other loans and the positive impact on interest expense
from declining high fixed-interest rate debt balances. 

Provision for Portfolio Loan Losses  

Provision expense was
$0.2 million during each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The low level of provision expense during each
of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily reflected solid economic conditions in the Company s markets,
which have led to lower levels of charge-offs in recent years. 

The Company had net charge-offs of $0.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and did not have any net charge-offs for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Noninterest Income  

The components of noninterest income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Noninterest income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.4 million to $2.2 million, as compared to $1.8 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in noninterest income during the third quarter of 2016, as compared with the same period
in 2015, was primarily due to higher gains on the sale of investment securities and the income from a forfeited escrow account
related to an OREO sale in 2015 (included in Other in the table above), partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of loans
held-for-sale. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, gains on sales of mortgage loans held-for-sale was $626,000, deferred fees on mortgage loans held-for-sale was $343,000,
gains on sales of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale was $8,000 and net losses recognized for the servicing of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale
was $56,000. By comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, gains on sales of mortgage loans held-for-sale was $247,000,
deferred fees on mortgage loans held-for-sale was $43,000, gains on sales of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale was $103,000, and net
gains recognized for the servicing of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale was $13,000. 

The Company expects gains on sales of loans
held-for-sale to contribute significantly towards our noninterest income in the future, as the Company continues to emphasize the
business activity of internally originating mortgage loans to be sold and participation in government programs relating to commercial
business loans originated to be sold. 

Noninterest Expense  

The components of noninterest expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Noninterest expense increased
$0.5 million to $6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $5.9 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in noninterest expense during the third quarter of 2016, as compared with the same period in 2015, primarily
reflected increased incentive compensation costs associated with the Company's continuing growth strategies and increased technology
costs, resulting from an increase in data processing costs associated with loan and deposit growth. 

With the Company s strengthened capital
and asset quality positions, management expects to maintain its lower levels of risk-related operating expenses, including the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency assessments, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance costs, accounting costs
and director   officer insurance costs, as well as to continue operating with lower levels of foreclosed asset and collection
expenses, although no assurances can be given. 

Income
Tax   

The Company recorded $0.9 million and $0.5
million in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s effective
tax rate was 37.1% for the third quarter of 2016. The future realization of the Company s net operating loss carryovers is
limited to $325,000 per year, excluding net operating loss carryovers of $0.6 million, which were generated after the first quarter
of 2013. The Company expects that the net operating loss carryovers generated after the first quarter of 2013 will be fully used
in 2016. Income taxes are discussed in further detail in  Note 11. Income Taxes  of the Notes contained in this Report. 

Comparison of Results of Operations
for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General  

Net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, was $4.4 million, as compared to net income of $7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s
return on assets ratio and return on equity ratio (both annualized) were 0.66% and 6.98%, respectively, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared with 1.24% and 12.28%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $2.6 million as compared to net income in the same period in 2015, primarily
due to the reversal of $8.5 million of the Company s valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the first half
of 2015, partially offset by $5.2 million of penalties associated with the early prepayment of some of the Company's wholesale
debt in the first half of 2015. Net income also benefited from an increase in net interest income of $4.1 million and an increase
in noninterest income of $2.1 million. Net interest income increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the impact of increased portfolio loans and other loans outstanding and decreased
interest expense for repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, partially offset by lower interest rates on portfolio loans, the
impact of lower balances in investment securities and increased interest expense on deposits. Noninterest income increased during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher gains on the sale of
investment securities, higher gains on the sale of both loans held-for-sale and portfolio loans, and the gain on the sale of the
Garden City branch and the income from a forfeited escrow account related to an OREO sale in 2015 (both of which are included in
Other noninterest income), partially offset by a decrease in service charges and fees, and a decrease in interchange fees. Noninterest
expense decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily
due to penalties associated with the prepayment of some of the Company's high-cost wholesale debt during the second quarter of
2015, partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs associated with the Company's continuing growth strategies. 

Average Balances,
Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid  

The following table sets
forth certain information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The average yields and costs are derived by dividing
income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. 

____________ 

(1)  Includes portfolio loans and other loans. Calculated net of deferred loan fees. Nonaccrual loans
included as loans carrying a zero yield.   

(2)  Calculated based on carrying value. State and municipal investment securities yields have not been
adjusted to full tax equivalents, as the numbers would not change materially from those presented in the table.   

(3)  Includes FHLB stock at cost and term deposits with other financial institutions.   

(4)  Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.   

Rate/Volume Analysis  

The following table presents
the dollar amount of changes in interest income for major components of interest-earning assets and in interest expense for major
components of interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable
to (1) changes in volume multiplied by the old interest rate; (2) changes in interest rate multiplied by the old volume; and (3)
changes not solely attributable to interest rate or volume, which have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume
and the change due to interest rate. 

____________ 

(1)  Includes portfolio loans and other loans. Calculated net of deferred loan fees. Nonaccrual loans
included as loans carrying a zero yield.   

Loan growth and lower
average rates paid on borrowed funds have driven the increase in net interest income, partially offset by lower average loan rates
and an increase in borrowed funds and interest-bearing deposits. 

Interest Income  

Total interest income
increased $3.2 million to $25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $22.0 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, due to higher balances in portfolio loans and other loans outstanding, partially offset by the
decrease in interest rates on portfolio loans and lower balances in investment securities. Interest income on loans increased to
$23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase was due to an increase in the average balance of loans, which increased $181.7 million to $716.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from $534.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a decrease
in average yield on loans of 55 basis points to 4.36% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The average balance of
loans increased due to an increase in portfolio loans and other loans outstanding. Originations of portfolio loans increased during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in increased interest income on portfolio loans outstanding and additional
fee income. Originations of warehouse loans held-for-investment increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, partially
offset by a decrease in the weighted average number of days outstanding for warehouse loans held-for-investment during the same
period, resulting in increased interest income and additional fee income. The increase in originations of warehouse loans held-for-investment
is the result of an increase in home purchase and refinance volume, and increased volume related to our expanded relationships
with current counterparties, as well as relationships with new counterparties. 

Interest income earned
on investment securities decreased $0.7 million to $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $47.0 million in the average balance
of investment securities to $84.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense
declined by $1.0 million to $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $6.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, due to the decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, partially
offset by increased interest expenses on deposits. The increase in interest expense on deposits in the first nine months of
2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily due to higher average rates paid on deposits and an
increase in the average balance in such deposits. The average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits,
increased 11 basis points to 0.61% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 0.50% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements in the first nine months of 2016, as
compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding repurchase agreement balances in
June 2015 and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to lower average
rates paid on FHLB advances resulting from the Bank s aggressive
strategies to manage interest rates, which were partially offset by an increase in the average balance of such advances. 

The Bank s overall
cost of funds, including noninterest-bearing deposits, was 0.97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down from 1.33%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the lower average balances and interest rates related to repurchase
agreements, as well as lower interest rates on FHLB advances and increased noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by higher
average balances in FHLB advances and an increase in the average rates paid on deposits and the average balance in such deposits.
The restructuring and refinancing transaction in the first nine months of 2015 substantially reduced the weighted average interest
rate, and related interest expense, on borrowings for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. 

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income increased
$4.1 million to $19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $15.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, due to the increase in portfolio loans and other loans outstanding and decreased interest expense for repurchase agreements
and FHLB advances, partially offset by lower interest rates on portfolio loans, the impact of lower balances in investment securities
and an increase in interest expense on deposits. 

Our net interest rate
spread, which is the difference between the interest rate earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rate paid on interest-bearing
liabilities, increased 22 basis points to 2.97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 2.75% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Our net interest margin, which is net interest income expressed as a percentage of our average
interest-earning assets, increased 19 basis points to 3.08% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 2.89%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin primarily reflected
the positive impact on interest income from increasing balances in portfolio loans and other loans and the positive impact on interest
expense from declining high fixed-interest rate debt balances, partially offset by the negative impact on interest income from
declining interest rates on portfolio loans, as well as the negative impact on interest income from lower balances in investment
securities. 

Provision for Portfolio Loan Losses  

Provision expense was
$0.6 million during both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The low level of provision expense during each of the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily reflected solid economic conditions in the Company s markets, which
have led to lower levels of charge-offs in recent years. 

The Company had net charge-offs of $0.2
million and $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Noninterest Income  

The components of noninterest income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

____________ 

(1)  Not meaningful.   

Noninterest income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.1 million to $7.3 million, as compared to $5.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in noninterest income during the first nine months of 2016, as compared with the same period
in 2015, was primarily due to higher gains on the sale of investment securities, higher gains on the sale of both loans held-for-sale
and portfolio loans, and the gain on the sale of the Garden City branch and the income from a forfeited escrow account related
to an OREO sale in 2015 (both of which are included in Other in the table above). 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, gains on sales of mortgage loans held-for-sale was $1,298,000, deferred fees on mortgage loans held-for-sale was $486,000,
gains on sales of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale was $730,000 and net gains recognized for the servicing of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale
was $56,000. By comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, gains on sales of mortgage loans held-for-sale was $600,000,
deferred fees on mortgage loans held-for-sale was $79,000, gains on sales of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale was $559,000, and net
gains recognized for the servicing of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale was $89,000. 

The Company expects gains on sales of loans
held-for-sale to contribute significantly towards our noninterest income in the future, as the Company continues to emphasize the
business activity of internally originating mortgage loans to be sold and participation in government programs relating to commercial
business loans originated to be sold. 

Noninterest Expense  

The components of noninterest expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Noninterest expense decreased
$3.6 million to $19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $22.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in noninterest expense during the first nine months of 2016, as compared with the same period in 2015, primarily
reflected the penalties associated with the prepayment of some of the Company's high-cost wholesale debt during the first half
of 2015, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation costs and occupancy costs, both associated with the Company s
continuing growth strategies and increased technology costs, resulting from an increase in data processing costs associated with
loan and deposit growth. 

With the Company s strengthened capital
and asset quality positions, management expects to maintain its lower levels of risk-related operating expenses, including the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency assessments, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance costs, accounting costs
and director   officer insurance costs, as well as to continue operating with lower levels of foreclosed asset and collection
expenses. 

Income
Tax   

The Company recorded $2.6 million in income
tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and recorded $9.9 million in income tax benefit for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The Company s effective tax rate was 37.1% for the first nine months of 2016. The $9.9 million income
tax benefit for the first nine months of 2015 substantially reflected the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
The future realization of the Company s net operating loss carryovers is limited to $325,000 per year, excluding net operating
loss carryovers of $0.6 million, which were generated after the first quarter of 2013. The Company expects that the net operating
loss carryovers generated after the first quarter of 2013 will be fully used in 2016. Income taxes are discussed in further detail
in  Note 11. Income Taxes  of the Notes contained in this Report. 

Liquidity  

The Company maintains a liquidity position
it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business.
The Company relies on a number of different sources of funds in order to meet its liquidity demands. The Company s primary
sources of funds are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments, sales of residential and SBA/USDA loans in
the secondary market, sales of investment securities, and borrowings. The scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities,
as well as proceeds from borrowings, are generally predictable sources of funds. In addition, warehouse loans held-for-investment
repay rapidly, with an average duration of approximately 13 days during the first nine months of 2016 and with repayments generally
funding advances. Other funding sources, however, such as inflows from new deposits, mortgage and investment securities prepayments
and mortgage loan sales are less predictable and greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 

We expect the Company s primary sources
of funds to continue to be sufficient to meet demands, although we can give no assurances, and the Bank has contingent liquidity
capacity available to meet potential funding requirements, including availability from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
and other institutional sources as discussed below. Management increased, and plans to continue to increase, the Bank s higher
interest-earning assets, using cash and cash equivalents as the funding source, due to the low interest rate environment on alternative
investment options. Consequently, the Bank s average balance of cash and cash equivalents has remained low, at $35.4 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $28.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and
consistent with this strategy, management expects that cash and cash equivalents will continue to be at a lower level throughout
the remainder of 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company had additional borrowing capacity of $45.9 million and $36.0 million, respectively, with the FHLB. The Company s
borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, as of September 30, 2016, included the ability to borrow up to approximately
$25.4 million under the Primary Credit program, based solely on the current amount of loans the Company has designated for pledging
with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and $10.0 million of daylight overdraft capacity. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016,
the Company had liquidity sources through one $17.0 million, one $10.0 million, and four $5.0 million lines of credit, all with
private financial institutions. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings against the Primary Credit program,
the daylight overdraft capacity or any of the aforementioned lines of credit with private financial institutions. A $10.0 million
line of credit for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions was utilized late in the fourth quarter of 2015, and was fully
repaid early in January 2016. Unpledged investment securities were approximately $44.7 million and $82.4 million as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The Company utilizes brokered deposits
to meet funding needs at interest rates typically equal to or less than the Bank s local market rates. As of September 30,
2016, the Bank had brokered deposits of $68.5 million, and expects it will continue to utilize such deposits, as necessary, to
supplement retail deposit production. Additionally, the Company utilizes a non-brokered Internet certificate of deposit listing
service to meet funding needs at interest rates typically equal to or less than the Bank s local market rates. As of September
30, 2016, the Bank had deposits from this service of $12.9 million, and expects it will continue to utilize the program, as necessary,
to supplement retail deposit production. 

Threats to our liquidity position and capital
levels include rapid declines in deposit balances due to market volatility caused by major changes in interest rates or negative
public perception about the Bank or the financial services industry in general. In addition, the amount of investment securities
that would otherwise be available to meet liquidity needs is limited due to the collateral requirements of our long-term debt.
Specifically, the Bank s repurchase agreements, which did not have an outstanding balance at September 30, 2016, have collateral
requirements in excess of the debt. Additionally, the collateral requirements of the FHLB debt are supplemented with investment
securities collateral and the Bank is required to collateralize any prepayment penalty amount using investment securities. 

For the first nine months of 2016, cash
and cash equivalents increased $26.3 million to $49.9 million as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $23.6 million as of December
31, 2015, due to the sale of investment securities, partially offset by the continued deployment of funds, as the Bank remains
focused on its strategy to increase portfolio loans and other higher yielding assets. For the first nine months of 2016, cash provided
by financing activities of $87.5 million exceeded cash used in investing activities of $59.9 million and operating activities of
$1.3 million. Primary sources of cash flows included proceeds from repayment of warehouse loans held-for-investment of $1,135.3
million, proceeds from FHLB advances of $943.0 million, net increases in deposits of $75.1 million, proceeds from the sale of investment
securities of $66.5 million, proceeds from sales of loans held-for-sale of $65.3 million and proceeds from the sale of portfolio
loans of $31.3 million. Primary uses of cash flows included funding of warehouse loans held-for-investment of $1,210.8 million,
the repayment of FHLB advances of $922.0 million, net increases in portfolio loans of $67.1 million (excluding the purchase of
such loans) and originations of loans held-for-sale of $65.7 million. 

For the first nine months of 2015, cash
and cash equivalents increased $15.3 million to $37.7 million as of September 30, 2015, as compared to $22.4 million as of December
31, 2014, due to borrowings throughout the first nine months of 2015 which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents.
The borrowings were in anticipation of further growth in loans, as the Bank remains focused on its strategy to increase portfolio
loans and other higher yielding assets. For the first nine months of 2015, cash provided by financing activities of $103.5 million
and cash provided by operating activities of $6.4 million exceeded cash used in investing activities of $94.6 million. Primary
sources of cash flows included proceeds from repayment of warehouse loans held-for-investment of $856.2 million, proceeds from
FHLB advances of $414.9 million, net increases in deposits of $56.0 million, proceeds from sales of loans held-for-sale of $19.9
million, proceeds from the sale of securities available-for-sale of $14.1 million, proceeds from maturities and payments of investment
securities of $13.2 million and proceeds from the redemption of FHLB stock of $13.0 million. Primary uses of cash flows included
funding of warehouse loans held-for-investment of $872.7 million, the repayment of FHLB advances of $299.0 million, the repayment
of repurchase agreements of $76.3 million, the purchase of portfolio loans of $56.0 million, net increases in portfolio loans of
$43.7 million (excluding the purchase of such loans) and the purchase of FHLB stock of $17.5 million.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES  

(a)  Evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures . The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility
of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls
and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required
to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based
upon this work and other evaluation procedures, management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has concluded that as of the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. 

(b)  Changes in internal control over
financial reporting . There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

(the Company), each certify in their capacity as an officer of the Company that they have reviewed the quarterly report of the
