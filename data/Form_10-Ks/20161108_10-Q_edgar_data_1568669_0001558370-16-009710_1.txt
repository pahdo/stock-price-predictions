SPECIAL NOTE   REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Report ) contains certain forward looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward looking terminology such as  may,   will,   should,   potential,   intend,   expect,   seek,   anticipate,   estimate,   approximately,   believe,   could,   project,   predict,   continue,   plan  or other similar words or expressions.  

Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, describe future plans and strategies, contain financial and operating projections or state other forward looking information. Examples of forward looking statements include the following: 

projections of our revenues, income, earnings per share, capital structure or other financial items;     

descriptions of our plans or objectives for future operations, products or services;     

forecasts of our future economic performance, interest rates, profit margins and our share of future markets; and     

descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing expectations regarding the timing of generating any revenues.     

Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future events, actions, plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations. Some of these factors are discussed below. 

You should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Report and the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 10, 2016. 

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include, but are not limited to: 

the continually changing federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to the highly regulated industry in which we operate;     

lawsuits or governmental actions if we do not comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses;     

the mortgage lending and servicing-related regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and its enforcement of these regulations;     

our dependence on U.S. government sponsored entities and changes in their current roles or their guarantees or guidelines;     

changes to government mortgage modification programs;     

the licensing and operational requirements of states and other jurisdictions applicable to our businesses, to which our bank competitors are not subject;     

foreclosure delays and changes in foreclosure practices;     

certain banking regulations that may limit our business activities;     

our dependence on the multi-family and commercial real estate sectors for future originations and investments in commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate related loans;     

changes in macroeconomic and U.S. real estate market conditions;     

difficulties inherent in growing loan production volume;     

difficulties inherent in adjusting the size of our operations to reflect changes in business levels;     

purchase opportunities for mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) and our success in winning bids;     

changes in prevailing interest rates;     

3 

Table of Contents  

increases in loan delinquencies and defaults;     

our reliance on PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust ( PMT ) as a significant source of financing for, and revenue related to, our mortgage banking business;     

any required additional capital and liquidity to support business growth that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all;     

our obligation to indemnify third party purchasers or repurchase loans if loans that we originate, acquire, service or assist in the fulfillment of, fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances;     

our obligation to indemnify PMT and certain investment funds if our services fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances;     

decreases in the historical returns on the assets that we select and manage for our clients, and our resulting management and incentive fees;     

the extensive amount of regulation applicable to our investment management segment;     

conflicts of interest in allocating our services and investment opportunities among ourselves and certain advised entities;     

the effect of public opinion on our reputation;     

our recent growth;     

our ability to effectively identify, manage, monitor and mitigate financial risks;     

our initiation of new business activities or expansion of existing business activities;     

our ability to detect misconduct and fraud; and     

our ability to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents.     

Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described in this Report or any other document.  Each of these factors could by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)     

Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation 

PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ( PFSI  or the  Company ) was formed as a Delaware corporation on December 31, 2012. Pursuant to a reorganization, the Company became a holding corporation and its primary asset is an equity interest in Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC ( PennyMac ). The Company is the managing member of PennyMac and operates and controls all of the businesses and affairs of PennyMac subject to the consent rights of other members under certain circumstances, and consolidates the financial results of PennyMac and its subsidiaries. 

PennyMac is a Delaware limited liability company which, through its subsidiaries, engages in mortgage banking and investment management activities. PennyMac s mortgage banking activities consist of residential mortgage loan production (including correspondent production and consumer direct lending) and mortgage loan servicing. PennyMac s investment management activities and a portion of its mortgage loan servicing activities are conducted on behalf of entities that invest in residential mortgage loans and related assets. PennyMac s primary wholly owned subsidiaries are: 

PNMAC Capital Management, LLC ( PCM )   a Delaware limited liability company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. PCM enters into investment management agreements with entities that invest in residential mortgage loans and related assets.     

Presently, PCM has management agreements with, PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LLC and PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, L.P., (the  Master Fund ), both registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, an affiliate of these registered funds, PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund Investors, LLC (collectively, the  Investment Funds ) and PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust ( PMT ), a publicly held real estate investment trust ( REIT ). Together, the Investment Funds and PMT are referred to as the  Advised Entities.  

PennyMac Loan Services, LLC ( PLS )   a Delaware limited liability company that services residential mortgage loans on behalf of non-affiliates and the Advised Entities, purchases and originates new prime credit quality residential mortgage loans, and engages in other mortgage banking activities for its own account and the account of PMT.     

PLS is approved as a seller/servicer of mortgage loans by the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) and as an issuer of securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ). PLS is a licensed Federal Housing Administration Nonsupervised Title II Lender with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) and a lender/servicer with the Veterans Administration ( VA ) and U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) (each an  Agency  and collectively the  Agencies ). 

PNMAC Opportunity Fund Associates, LLC ( PMOFA )   a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of the Master Fund. PMOFA is entitled to incentive fees representing allocations of profits ( Carried Interest ) from the Master Fund.     

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB )   Accounting Standards Codification   ( ASC ) for interim financial information and with the SEC s instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements and notes do not include all of the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The interim consolidated information should be read together with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, income, and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily

Table of Contents  

indicative of income to be anticipated for the full year ending December 31, 2016.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

Preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results will likely differ from those estimates. 

Note 2 Concentration of Risk 

A substantial portion of the Company s activities relate to the Advised Entities. Fees (generally comprised of fulfillment fees, mortgage loan servicing fees, management fees, Carried Interest and servicing recapture fees) and interest charged to these entities totaled 15% and 20% of total net revenue for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 22% and 18% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Amounts due from and payable to the Investment Funds are summarized below: 

Exchanged Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC Unitholders 

The Company entered into a tax receivable agreement with PennyMac s existing unitholders on the date of the IPO that will provide for the payment by the Company to PennyMac s exchanged unitholders an amount equal to 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that the Company is deemed to realize as a result of (i) increases in tax basis of PennyMac s assets resulting from such unitholders  exchanges and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. Based on the PennyMac unitholder exchanges to date, the Company has recorded a $75.4 million and $74.3 million   Payable to exchanged Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC unitholders under tax receivable agreement   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company made payments under the tax receivable agreement totaling $4.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. There were no payments made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Note 4 Earnings Per Share of Common Stock 

Basic earnings per share of common stock is determined using net income attributable to the Company s common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock is determined by dividing diluted net income attributable to the Company s common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, assuming all dilutive shares of common stock were issued. 

Potentially dilutive shares of common stock include non-vested unit and stock-based compensation awards and PennyMac Class A units. The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding represented by the non-vested unit and stock-based compensation awards. The diluted earnings per share calculation assumes the exchange of PennyMac Class A units for shares of common stock. Accordingly, earnings attributable to the Company s common stockholders is also adjusted to include the earnings allocated to the PennyMac Class A units after taking into account the income taxes that would be applicable to such earnings. 

14 

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations: 

Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the anti-dilutive weighted-average number of outstanding stock options and performance-based restricted stock units ( RSUs ) excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share: 

(1) 

Certain stock options were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the weighted-average exercise prices were anti-dilutive.      

(2) 

Certain performance-based RSUs were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the performance thresholds included in such RSUs have not been achieved.      

Note 5 Loan Sales and Servicing Activities 

The Company originates or purchases and sells mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market without recourse for credit losses. However, the Company maintains continuing involvement with the mortgage loans sold in the form of servicing arrangements and the liability under representations and warranties it makes to purchasers and insurers of the mortgage loans sold.

Following is a summary of the geographical distribution of mortgage loans included in the Company s servicing portfolio for the top five and all other states as measured by UPB: 

Note 6 Netting of Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk for the interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs ) it makes to purchase or originate mortgage loans at specified interest rates, its inventory of mortgage loans held for sale and MSRs. The Company has elected to present net derivative asset and liability positions, and cash collateral obtained from (or posted to) its counterparties when subject to a master netting arrangement that is legally enforceable on all counterparties in the event of default. The derivatives that are not subject to a master netting arrangement are IRLCs.

Offsetting of Derivative Liabilities and Financial Liabilities 

Following is a summary of net derivative liabilities and assets sold under agreements to repurchase and related netting amounts. As discussed above, all derivatives with the exception of IRLCs are subject to master netting arrangements. The mortgage loans sold under agreements to repurchase do not qualify for set off accounting.

Table of Contents  

Derivative Liabilities, Financial Liabilities, and Collateral Held by Counterparty 

The following table summarizes by significant counterparty the amount of derivative liabilities and assets sold under agreements to repurchase after considering master netting arrangements and financial instruments or cash pledged that do not qualify under the accounting guidance for netting. All assets sold under agreements to repurchase are secured by sufficient collateral or have fair value that exceeds the liability amount recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Note 7 Fair Value 

The Company s consolidated financial statements include assets and liabilities that are measured based on their fair values. The application of fair value may be on a recurring or nonrecurring basis depending on the accounting principles applicable to the specific asset or liability and whether management has elected to carry the item at its fair value as discussed in the following paragraphs. 

The Company groups its assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value. These levels are: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     

Level 2 Prices determined or determinable using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. These may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk and other inputs.     

Level 3 Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where observable inputs are unavailable, unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, and are based on the best information available in the circumstances.     

As a result of the difficulty in observing certain significant valuation inputs affecting  Level 3  fair value assets and liabilities, the Company is required to make judgments regarding these items  fair values. Different persons in possession of the same facts may reasonably arrive at different conclusions as to the inputs to be applied in valuing these assets and liabilities and their fair values. Likewise, due to the general   

21 

Table of Contents  

illiquidity of some of these assets and liabilities, subsequent transactions may be at values significantly different from those reported. 

Fair Value Accounting Elections 

Management identified all of its non-cash financial assets, its originated MSRs relating to loans with initial interest rates of more than 4.5%, purchased MSRs subject to excess servicing spread financing ( ESS ) and mortgage servicing liabilities ( MSLs ) to be accounted for at fair value so changes in fair value will be reflected in income as they occur and more timely reflect the results of the Company s performance. Management has also elected to account for its ESS at fair value as a means of hedging the related MSRs  fair value risk.  

Financial Statement Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Following is a summary of financial statement items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Amortized Cost 

The Company s   Cash   as well as its   Carried Interest due from Investment Funds  ,    Note receivable from PMT,     Assets sold under agreements to repurchase  ,    Mortgage loan participation and sale agreements  ,    Notes payable  ,    Obligations under capital lease   and amounts receivable from and payable to the Advised Entities are carried at amortized cost. 

Cash   is measured using a  Level 1  fair value input.  

The Company has concluded that the carrying value of the   Carried Interest due from Investment Funds   approximates its fair value as the balance represents the amount distributable to the Company at the balance sheet date assuming liquidation of the Investment Funds. 

The Company s borrowings carried at amortized cost do not have observable inputs and the fair value is measured using management s estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. The Company has classified these financial instruments as  Level 3  fair value financial statement items due to the lack of observable inputs to estimate their fair values. 

The Company has concluded that the fair value of the   Note receivable from PMT   and the receivables from and payables to the Advised Entities approximate the carrying value due to their short terms and/or variable interest rates. 

Valuation Techniques and Inputs 

Most of the Company s financial assets, a portion of its MSRs and its ESS financing and MSLs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. Certain of the Company s financial assets and all of its MSRs, ESS and MSLs are  Level 3  fair value financial statement items which require the use of unobservable inputs that are significant to the estimation of the items  fair values. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, and are based on the best information available under the circumstances. 

Due to the difficulty in estimating the fair values of  Level 3  fair value financial statement items, management has assigned the responsibility for estimating the fair value of these items to specialized staff and subjects the valuation process to significant senior management oversight. The Company s Financial Analysis and Valuation group (the  FAV group ) is the Company s specialized staff responsible for estimating the fair values of  Level 3  fair value financial statement items other than IRLCs and maintaining its valuation policies and procedures. 

With respect to the non-IRLC  Level 3  valuations, the FAV group reports to the Company s senior management valuation committee, which oversees and approves the valuations. The FAV group monitors the models used for valuation of the Company s  Level 3  fair value financial statement items, including the models  performance versus actual results, and reports those results to the Company s senior management valuation committee. The Company s senior management valuation committee includes the Company s chief executive, financial, operating, risk, business development and asset/liability management officers. 

The FAV group is responsible for reporting to the Company s senior management valuation committee on a monthly basis on the changes in the valuation of the  Level 3  fair value financial statement items, including major factors affecting the valuation and any changes in model methods and inputs. To assess the reasonableness of its   

30 

Table of Contents  

valuations, the FAV group presents an analysis of the effect on the valuation of changes to the significant inputs to the models.  

With respect to IRLCs, the Company has assigned responsibility for developing fair values to its Capital Markets Risk Management staff. The fair values developed by the Capital Markets Risk Management staff are reviewed by the Company s Capital Markets Operations group. 

Following is a description of the techniques and inputs used in estimating the fair values of  Level 2  and  Level 3  fair value financial statement items: 

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 

Most of the Company s mortgage loans held for sale at fair value are saleable into active markets and are therefore categorized as  Level 2  fair value financial statement items and their fair values are determined using their quoted market or contracted selling price or market price equivalent. 

Certain of the Company s mortgage loans held for sale may become non-saleable into active markets due to identification of a defect by the Company or to the repurchase by the Company of a mortgage loan with an identified defect. The Company may also purchase certain delinquent government guaranteed or insured mortgage loans from Ginnie Mae guaranteed pools in its mortgage loan servicing portfolio.  

The Company s right to purchase delinquent government guaranteed or insured mortgage loans arises as the result of the borrower s failure to make payments for at least three consecutive months preceding the month of repurchase by the Company and provides an alternative to the Company s obligation to continue advancing principal and interest at the coupon rate of the related Ginnie Mae security. Such repurchased mortgage loans may be resold to third-party investors and thereafter may be repurchased to the extent eligible for resale into a new Ginnie Mae guaranteed pool. 

To the extent such mortgage loans have not become saleable into another Ginnie Mae guaranteed security by becoming current either through the borrower s reperformance or through completion of a modification of the mortgage loan s terms, the Company measures such mortgage loans along with mortgage loans with identified defects using  Level 3  fair value inputs.  

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s  Level 3  fair value mortgage loans held for sale at fair value are discount rates, home price projections, voluntary prepayment/resale speeds and total prepayment speeds. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significant change to the mortgage loans  fair value measurement. Increases in home price projections are generally accompanied by an increase in voluntary prepayment speeds. 

Following is a quantitative summary of key  Level 3  fair value inputs used in the valuation of mortgage loans held for sale at fair value: 

(1) 

Voluntary prepayment/resale speed is measured using Life Voluntary Conditional Prepayment Rate ( CPR ).     

(2)  Total prepayment speed is measured using Life Total CPR. 

31 

Table of Contents  

Changes in fair value attributable to changes in instrument specific credit risk are measured by reference to the change in the respective mortgage loan s delinquency status and performance history at period end from the later of the beginning of the period or acquisition date. Changes in fair value of mortgage loans held for sale are included in   Net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

Interest Rate Lock Commitments 

The Company categorizes IRLCs as a  Level 3  fair value financial statement item. The Company estimates the fair value of an IRLC based on quoted Agency MBS prices, its estimate of the fair value of the MSRs it expects to receive in the sale of the mortgage loans and the probability that the mortgage loan will fund or be purchased (the  pull-through rate ). 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s IRLCs are the pull-through rate and the MSR component of the Company s estimate of the fair value of the mortgage loans it has committed to purchase. Significant changes in the pull-through rate or the MSR component of the IRLCs, in isolation, could result in significant changes in fair value measurement. The financial effects of changes in these inputs are generally inversely correlated as increasing interest rates have a positive effect on the fair value of the MSR component of IRLC fair value, but increase the pull-through rate for the mortgage loan principal and interest payment cash flow component, which has decreased in fair value. Changes in fair value of IRLCs are included in   Net gains on mortgage loans acquired for sale at fair value   in the consolidated statements of income. 

Following is a quantitative summary of key  Level 3  fair value inputs used in the valuation of IRLCs: 

Hedging Derivatives 

The Company estimates the fair value of commitments to sell mortgage loans based on quoted MBS prices.     These derivative financial instruments are categorized by the Company as  Level 1  fair value financial statement items for those based on exchange traded market prices or as  Level 2  fair value financial statement items for those based on observable MBS prices or  interest rate volatilities in the MBS market. Changes in the fair value of hedging derivatives are included in   Net gains on mortgage loans acquired for sale at fair value, or Net mortgage loan servicing fees  , as applicable, in the consolidated statements of income.  

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

MSRs are categorized as  Level 3  fair value financial statement items. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting net servicing cash flows discounted at a rate that management believes market participants would use in their determinations of fair value. The key inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include the prepayment rates of the underlying mortgage loans, the applicable pricing spread (discount rate), and the per-loan annual cost to service the respective mortgage loans. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are included in   Net servicing fees     Amortization, impairment and change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights   in the consolidated statements of income.

Table of Contents  

Following are the key  Level 3  fair value inputs used in determining the fair value of MSRs at the time of initial recognition, excluding MSR purchases: 

(1) 

Pricing spread represents a margin that is applied to a reference interest rate s forward rate curve to develop periodic discount rates. The Company applies a pricing spread to the United States Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) curve for purposes of discounting cash flows relating to MSRs.     

(2) 

Prepayment speed is measured using Life Total CPR.

Following is a quantitative summary of key inputs used in the valuation and assessment for impairment of the Company s MSRs at period end and the effect on fair value from adverse changes in those inputs (weighted averages are based upon UPB): 

(1) 

The Company applies a pricing spread to the United States Dollar LIBOR curve for purposes of discounting cash flows relating to MSRs.     

(2) 

For MSRs carried at fair value, an adverse change in one of the above-mentioned key inputs is expected to result in a reduction in fair value which will be recognized in income. For MSRs carried at lower of amortized cost or fair value, an adverse change in one of the above-mentioned key inputs may result in recognition of MSR impairment. The extent of the recognized MSR impairment will depend on the relationship of fair value to the carrying value of such MSRs.     

(3) 

Prepayment speed is measured using Life Total CPR.     

The preceding sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time; only contemplate the movements in the indicated inputs; do not incorporate changes to other inputs; are subject to the accuracy of various models and inputs used; and do not incorporate other factors that would affect the Company s overall financial performance in such events, including operational adjustments made by management to account for changing circumstances. For these reasons, the preceding estimates should not be viewed as earnings forecasts.

Excess Servicing Spread Financing at Fair Value 

The Company categorizes ESS as a  Level 3  fair value financial statement item. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of ESS. The key inputs used in the estimation of ESS fair value include pricing spread and prepayment speed. Significant changes to either of those inputs in isolation could result in a significant change in the fair value of ESS. Changes in these key inputs are not necessarily directly related. 

ESS is generally subject to fair value increases when mortgage interest rates increase. Increasing mortgage interest rates normally slow mortgage refinancing activity. Decreased refinancing activity increases the life of the mortgage loans underlying the ESS, thereby increasing its fair value, which is owed to PMT. Increases in the fair value of ESS decrease income and are included in   Net mortgage loan servicing fees.  

Interest expense for ESS is accrued using the interest method based upon the expected cash flows from the ESS through the expected life of the underlying mortgage loans. Other changes in fair value are recorded in   Amortization, impairment and change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights  . 

Following are the key inputs used in estimating the fair value of ESS: 

(1)  The Company applies a pricing spread to the United States Dollar LIBOR curve for purposes of discounting cash flows relating to ESS. 

(2)  Prepayment speed is measured using Life Total CPR.

Note 9 Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company is exposed to fair value risk relative to its mortgage loans held for sale as well as to its IRLCs and MSRs. The Company bears fair value risk from the time an IRLC is made to PMT or a loan applicant to the time the mortgage loan is sold. The Company is exposed to loss in fair value of its IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale when market mortgage interest rates increase. The Company is exposed to loss in fair value of its MSRs when market mortgage interest rates decrease. 

The Company engages in interest rate risk management activities in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. To manage this fair value risk resulting from interest rate risk, the Company uses derivative financial instruments acquired with the intention of reducing the risk that changes in market interest rates will result in unfavorable changes in the fair value of the Company s IRLCs, inventory of mortgage loans held for sale and MSRs. 

The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than in support of its risk management activities other than IRLCs, which are generated in the process of purchasing or originating mortgage loans held for sale. The Company records all derivative financial instruments at fair value and records changes in fair value in current period income. 

The Company had the following derivative financial instruments recorded on its consolidated balance sheets:

Note 11 Carried Interest Due from Investment Funds 

The activity in the Company s Carried Interest due from Investment Funds is summarized as follows: 

The amount of the Carried Interest that will be received by the Company depends on the Investment Funds  future performance. As a result, the amount of Carried Interest recorded by the Company is based on the cash flows that would be produced assuming termination of the Investment Funds at period end and may be reduced in future periods based on the performance of the Investment Funds in those periods. However, the Company is not required to pay guaranteed returns to the Investment Funds and the amount of any reduction to Carried Interest will be limited to the amounts previously recognized. 

Management expects the Carried Interest to be collected by the Company when the Investment Funds liquidate. The limited liability company and limited partnership agreements of the Investment Funds specify that the funds will continue in existence through December 31, 2016, subject to three one-year extensions by PCM at its discretion. PCM has elected to extend the relevant agreements of the Investment Funds for the first of such three one-year extensions.

Note 12 Borrowings 

The borrowing facilities described throughout this Note 12 contain various covenants, including financial covenants governing the Company s net worth, debt-to-equity ratio, profitability and liquidity. Management believes that the Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2016.  

Assets Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase 

The Company has multiple borrowing facilities in the form of asset sales under agreements to repurchase. These borrowing facilities are secured by mortgage loans held for sale at fair value or participation certificates backed by MSRs. Eligible mortgage loans and participation certificates backed by MSRs are sold at advance rates based on the fair value of the assets sold. Interest is charged at a rate based on the buyer s overnight cost of funds rate or on LIBOR depending on the terms of the respective agreement. Mortgage loans and MSRs financed under these agreements may be re-pledged by the lenders. 

Following is a summary of financial information relating to assets sold under agreements to repurchase:

Following is a summary of maturities of outstanding advances under repurchase agreements by maturity date:  

The amount at risk (the fair value of the assets pledged plus the related margin deposit, less the amount advanced by the counterparty and interest payable) relating to the Company s mortgage loans held for sale sold under agreements to repurchase is summarized by counterparty below as of September 30, 2016: 

The Company is subject to margin calls during the period the agreements are outstanding and therefore may be required to repay a portion of the borrowings before the respective agreements mature if the fair value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets securing those agreements decreases.  

Mortgage Loan Participation and Sale Agreements 

Certain of the borrowing facilities secured by mortgage loans held for sale are in the form of a mortgage loan participation and sale agreements. Participation certificates, each of which represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in mortgage loans that have been pooled with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, are sold to the lender pending the securitization of the mortgage loans and sale of the resulting securities. A commitment to sell the securities resulting from the pending securitization between the Company and a non-affiliate is also assigned to the lender at the time a participation certificate is sold. 

The purchase price paid by the lender for each participation certificate is based on the trade price of the security, plus an amount of interest expected to accrue on the security to its anticipated delivery date, minus a present value adjustment, any related hedging costs and a holdback amount that is based on a percentage of the purchase price. The holdback amount is not required to be paid to the Company until the settlement of the security and its delivery to the lender. 

The mortgage loan participation and sale agreements are summarized below:

Notes Payable 

The Company entered into a revolving credit agreement classified as a note payable, dated as of December 30, 2015, pursuant to which the lenders have agreed to make revolving loans in an amount not to exceed $100,000,000. Interest on the note payable accrues at an annual rate of interest equal to, at the election of the Company, either LIBOR plus the applicable contract margin or an alternate base rate.  The maturity date of the note payable is 364 days following the date of the revolving credit agreement. The proceeds of the note payable are to be used solely for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

During December 2015, the Company entered into a second note payable which is secured by MSRs relating to certain mortgage loans in the Company s servicing portfolio.  Interest is charged at a rate based on LIBOR plus the applicable contract margin. 

Notes payable are summarized below:

Obligations under capital lease are summarized below: 

Excess Servicing Spread Financing 

In conjunction with the Company s purchase from non-affiliates of certain MSRs relating to pools of Agency-backed residential mortgage loans, the Company has entered into sale and assignment agreements with PMT. Under these agreements, the Company sold to PMT the right to receive ESS cash flows relating to certain MSRs. The Company retained a fixed base servicing fee and all ancillary income associated with servicing the mortgage loans. The Company continues to be the servicer of the mortgage loans and provides all servicing functions, including the responsibility to make servicing advances.  

Following is a summary of ESS:

Note 14 Income Taxes 

The Company s effective tax rates were 12.2% and 11.6% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 12.0% and 11.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The difference between the Company s effective tax rate and the statutory rate is primarily due to the allocation of earnings to the noncontrolling interest unitholders. As the noncontrolling interest unitholders convert their ownership units into the Company s shares, the portion of the Company s income that will be subject to corporate federal and state statutory tax rates will increase, which will in turn increase the Company s effective income tax rate.

ASU 2014-09 provides guidance intended to assist in the identification of contracts with customers and separate performance obligations within those contracts, the determination and allocation of the transaction price to those identified performance obligations and the recognition of revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied. ASU 2014-09 also requires disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. 

Upon adoption, ASU 2014-09 provides for transition through either a full retrospective approach requiring the restatement of all presented prior periods or a modified retrospective approach, which allows the new recognition standard to be applied to only those contracts that are not completed at the date of transition. If the modified retrospective approach is adopted, a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings is performed with additional disclosures required including the amount by which each line item is affected by the transition as compared to the guidance in effect before adoption and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes in these amounts. 

The FASB has issued several amendments to the new revenue standard ASU 2014-09, including:

Table of Contents  

2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.     

In March 2015, ASU 2016-08,   Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   The amendments to this update are intended to improve the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in ASU 2014-09 by clarifying how an entity should identify the unit of account (i.e. the specified good or service) and how an entity should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements.     

In May 2016, ASU 2016-12,   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.   The amendments to this update clarify certain core recognition principles and provide practical expedients available at transition. The improvements address collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.     

The Company is currently evaluating the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its impact on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet identified which transition method will be applied upon adoption. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related note disclosures. 

Under GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. 

ASU 2014-15 extends the responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment to management and contains guidance on (1) how to perform a going-concern assessment and (2) when going-concern disclosures would be required under U.S. GAAP.  

Under ASU 2014-15, an entity would be required to evaluate its status as a going concern as part of its periodic financial statement preparation process and would be required to disclose information about its potential inability to continue as a going concern when  substantial doubt  about its ability to continue as a going concern for the period of one year from the earlier of the date its financial statements are issued or are ready to be issued. 

If management concludes that there is  substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, it must disclose the principal conditions or events causing substantial doubt to be raised, management s evaluation of the conditions and management s plans. If substantial doubt is not alleviated as a result of management s plans, the company is required to include a statement that there is  substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU 2014-15 also requires an entity to disclose how the substantial doubt was resolved in the period that substantial doubt no longer exists. 

ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending December 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have an effect on the financial statements of the Company. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2015-

02 effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 had no effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments, and the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.  

ASU 2016-01 requires that:  

All equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) with readily determinable fair values will generally be measured at fair value through earnings.      

When the fair value option has been elected for financial liabilities, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. The accumulated gains and losses due to these changes will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings if the financial liability is settled before maturity.      

For financial instruments measured at amortized cost, public business entities will be required to use the exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.      

Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category (e.g., fair value, amortized cost, lower of cost or fair value) and form of financial asset (e.g., loans, securities).      

Public business entities will no longer be required to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost.      

Entities will have to assess the realizability of a deferred tax asset related to a debt security classified as available for sale in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.      

The classification and measurement guidance will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income is permitted and can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  , Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ).  ASU 2016-02 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors) and supersedes previous leasing standards. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.  

ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, The FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation   (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: 

Modifies the accounting for income taxes relating to share-based payments. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards will be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.      

57 

Table of Contents  

An entity will recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. Under current GAAP, excess tax benefits are recognized in additional paid-in capital; tax deficiencies are recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or in the consolidated income statement in the period they reduce income taxes payable.     

Changes the classification of excess tax benefits on the consolidated statement of cash flows. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, excess tax benefits will be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. Under current GAAP, excess tax benefits are separated from other income tax cash flows and classified as a financing activity.     

Changes the requirement to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest. Under ASC 2016-09, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest as presently required or account for forfeitures when they occur. Under current GAAP, accruals of compensation cost are based on the number of awards that are expected to vest.     

Changes the tax withholding requirements for share-based payment awards to qualify for equity accounting. The threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. Under current GAAP, for an award to qualify for equity classification is that an entity cannot partially settle the award in cash in excess of the employer s minimum statutory withholding requirements.     

Establishes GAAP for the classification of employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes. Cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax- withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. This guidance establishes GAAP related to the classification of withholding taxes in the statement of cash flows as there is no such guidance under current GAAP.     

ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

On October 17, 2016, the Company, through PLS and PNMAC, entered into amendments (the  October Amendments ) to the terms of (i) its Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2016, by and among Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital LLC ( CSFB ), PLS and PNMAC (the  CSFB Repurchase Agreement ), pursuant to which PLS may sell to, and later repurchase from, CSFB certain newly originated or recently acquired residential and small balance multifamily mortgage loans; and (ii) its Master Repurchase Agreement (Participation Certificates and Servicing) by and among CSFB, PLS and PNMAC and dated as of November 10, 2015 (the  MSR Repo ), pursuant to which PLS may finance certain of its mortgage servicing rights and related participation interests and loan servicing advance receivables.     

The original terms of the CSFB Repurchase Agreement and the MSR Repo collectively provided for a maximum combined purchase price of $907 million. Of this amount, $700 million was committed and available for purchases under the CSFB Repurchase Agreement to the extent not reduced by purchased amounts outstanding under the MSR Repo, while $407 million was committed and available for purchases under the MSR Repo to the extent not reduced by purchased amounts outstanding under the CSFB Repurchase Agreement. On September 26, 2016, CSFB previously agreed to increase the maximum combined purchase price provided for under the CSFB Repurchase Agreement and the MSR Repo from $907 million to $1.207 billion until October 26, 2016, at which time the maximum combined purchase price would be reset to $907 million.  Pursuant to the terms of the October Amendments, CSFB agreed to extend such increase in the maximum combined purchase price to December 23, 2016. 

On November 1, 2016, the Company, through PLS and PNMAC, entered into a master repurchase (the  JPM Repurchase Agreement ) agreement by and among JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ( JPM ), pursuant to which PLS may sell to JPM participation certificates, each of which represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a pool of mortgage loans that have been pooled with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae and are pending securitization, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million. In connection with its sale of any participation certificate, PLS will also assign to JPM a take-out commitment, which evidences PLS  right to sell to a third-party investor the security backed by the mortgage loans underlying the related participation certificate.  The scheduled maturity date of the JPM Repurchase Agreement is October 31, 2017, and the obligations of PLS are fully guaranteed by PNMAC.      

On November 3, 2016, the Company, through PNMAC, entered into Schedule Number 003 (the  Schedule ) to that certain Master Lease Agreement (the  Master Lease ), dated as of December 9, 2015, with Banc of America Leasing   Capital, LLC ( BALC ).

Overview 

The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the words  we,   us,   our  and the  Company  refer to PFSI. 

Our Company 

We are a specialty financial services firm with a comprehensive mortgage platform and integrated business primarily focused on the production and servicing of U.S. residential mortgage loans (activities which we refer to as mortgage banking) and the management of investments related to the U.S. mortgage market. We believe that our operating capabilities, specialized expertise, access to long-term investment capital, and our management s experience across all aspects of the mortgage business will allow us to profitably grow these activities and capitalize on other related opportunities as they arise in the future. 

We operate and control all of the business and affairs of Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC ( PennyMac ) and are its sole managing member. PennyMac was founded in 2008 by members of our executive leadership team and two strategic partners, BlackRock Mortgage Ventures, LLC and HC Partners, LLC, formerly known as Highfields Capital Investments, LLC, together with its affiliates. 

We conduct our business in three segments: loan production, loan servicing (together, these two activities comprise our mortgage banking activities) and investment management. Our principal mortgage banking subsidiary, PennyMac Loan Services, LLC ( PLS ), is a non-bank producer and servicer of mortgage loans in the United States. PLS is a seller/servicer for the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ), each of which is a government-sponsored entity ( GSE ). It is also an approved issuer of securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ), a lender of the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ), a lender/servicer of the Veterans Administration ( VA ) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ), and a servicer for the Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ). We refer to each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA and USDA as an  Agency  and collectively as the  Agencies.  PLS is able to service loans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and originate loans in 49 states and the District of Columbia, either because PLS is properly licensed in a particular jurisdiction or exempt or otherwise not required to be licensed in that jurisdiction. 

Our investment management subsidiary, PNMAC Capital Management, LLC ( PCM ), is a Delaware limited liability company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended, PCM manages PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust ( PMT ), a mortgage real estate investment trust, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PMT, PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LLC and PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LP, both registered under the Investment

Company Act of 1940 ( Investment Company Act ), as amended, an affiliate of these Funds and PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund Investors, LLC. We refer to these funds collectively as our  Investment Funds  and, together with PMT, as our  Advised Entities.  

Mortgage Banking 

Loan Production 

Our loan production segment sources mortgage loans through two channels: correspondent production and consumer direct lending.  

In correspondent production we manage, on behalf of PMT and for our own account, the acquisition of newly originated, prime credit quality, first-lien residential mortgage loans that have been underwritten to investor guidelines. PMT acquires, from approved correspondent sellers, newly originated mortgage loans, including both conventional and government-insured or guaranteed residential mortgage loans that qualify for inclusion in securitizations that are guaranteed by the Agencies. For conventional mortgage loans, we perform fulfillment activities for PMT and earn a fulfillment fee for each mortgage loan purchased by PMT. In the case of government guaranteed or insured mortgage loans, we purchase them from PMT at PMT s cost plus a sourcing fee and fulfill them for our own account.  

Through our consumer direct lending channel, we originate new prime credit quality, first-lien residential conventional and government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans on a national basis to allow customers to purchase or refinance their homes. The consumer direct model relies on the Internet and call center-based staff to acquire and interact with customers across the country. We do not have a  brick and mortar  branch network and have been developing our consumer direct operations with call centers strategically positioned across the United States.  

For loans originated through our consumer direct lending channel, we conduct our own fulfillment, earn interest income and gains or losses during the holding period and upon the sale or securitization of these loans, and retain the associated MSRs (subject to sharing with PMT a portion of such MSRs or cash with respect to certain consumer direct originated loans that refinance loans for which the related mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) or excess servicing spread ( ESS ) was held by PMT). 

Our loan production activity is summarized below: 

Loan Servicing 

Our mortgage loan servicing segment performs mortgage loan administration, collection, and default management activities, including the collection and remittance of mortgage loan payments; response to customer inquiries; accounting for principal and interest; holding custodial (impounded) funds for the payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. We service a diverse portfolio of mortgage loans both as the owner of MSRs and on behalf of other MSR or mortgage owners. We provide servicing for conventional and government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans ( prime servicing ), as well as servicing for distressed mortgage loans that have been acquired as investments by our Advised Entities ( special servicing ) and we have acquired through the assumption of mortgage servicing liabilities. As of September 30, 2016, the portfolio of mortgage loans that we serviced or subserviced totaled approximately $182.1

billion in UPB. 

Investment Management 

We are an investment manager through our subsidiary, PCM. PCM currently manages the Advised Entities. The Advised Entities had combined net assets of approximately $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2016. For these activities, we earn management fees as a percentage of the respective Advised Entities  net assets and incentive compensation based on the entities  performance. 

Observations on Current Market Conditions  

Our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions in the United States, including economic growth, unemployment rates, the residential housing market and interest rate levels and expectations. The U.S. economy continues to grow, albeit at a modest pace, as reflected in recent economic data. During the third quarter of 2016, U.S. real gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 2.9% compared to 2.0% for the third quarter of 2015 and 1.4% for the second quarter of 2016. The national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.0% at September 30, 2016 compared to 4.9% at June 30, 2016 and 5.1% at September 30, 2015. Delinquency rates on residential real estate loans remain elevated compared to historical rates, but have been steadily declining. As reported by the Federal Reserve Bank, during the second quarter of 2016, the delinquency rate on residential real estate loans held by commercial banks was 4.6%, a reduction from 5.8% during the second quarter of 2015. 

Residential real estate activity remains strong. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of existing home sales for September 2016 was 0.6% higher than for September 2015, and the national median existing home price for all housing types was $234,200, a 5.6% increase from September 2015 (Source: National Association of Realtors ). On a national level, foreclosure filings during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 10% as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. However, foreclosure activity is expected to remain above historical average levels through 2016 and beyond. 

Changes in fixed-rate residential mortgage loan interest rates generally follow changes in long-term U.S. Treasury yields. Thirty-year fixed mortgage interest rates ranged from a low of 3.41% to a high of 3.50% during the third quarter of 2016 while during the third quarter of 2015, thirty-year fixed mortgage interest rates ranged from a low of 3.84% to a high of 4.09% (Source: Freddie Mac s Weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey). Interest rates generally remained flat in the third quarter of 2016.  

Mortgage lenders originated an estimated $580 billion of home loans during the third quarter of 2016, up 27.5% from the third quarter of 2015. Total mortgage originations are forecast to be higher in 2016 versus 2015, with current industry estimates for 2016 averaging $1.9 trillion (Source: average of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts). 

We believe there is long-term market opportunity for the production of non-Agency jumbo mortgage loans. However, most new jumbo mortgage loans are either being originated or purchased by banks, and the current market for jumbo mortgage loan securitizations is limited, as evidenced by weak demand and inconsistent pricing observed throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016. Prime jumbo MBS securitizations totaled $1.0 billion in UPB during the third quarter of 2016, a decrease from $2.1 billion during the third quarter of 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we produced approximately $14 million in UPB of jumbo loans compared to $111 million in UPB of jumbo loans produced during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

In our capacity as an investment manager, we expect to see a continued supply of distressed whole loans; however, we believe the pricing for recent transactions has been less attractive for buyers. We are transitioning PMT s portfolio away from distressed whole loans to correspondent-related investments such as CRT and MSRs, and we continue to monitor the market to assess best execution opportunities for distressed portfolio investments held by the Advised Entities.

Results of Operations 

Our results of operations are summarized below: 

(1) 

Relates to parent Company interest expense eliminated in consolidation.     

Net income increased $57.0 million and $44.5 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. These changes reflect the effects on our mortgage banking activities of decreasing interest rates during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  The increase in net income during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in   net     gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   that was partially offset by a decrease in   net mortgage loan servicing fees   and an increase in expenses incurred to accommodate our growth.

Net Gains on Mortgage Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value 

Most of our mortgage loan production is centered in government-insured or guaranteed loans. Over recent periods, the margins on correspondent government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans have tended to be higher than those on conventional correspondent production. Government-insured or guaranteed mortgage lending is not as competitive as conventional conforming mortgage lending due to the added complexity involved in the origination and servicing of government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans. We source the majority of our government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loan production through PMT. PMT is not approved by Ginnie Mae as an issuer of Ginnie Mae-guaranteed securities which are backed by government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans. We purchase the government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans that PMT acquires through its correspondent lending activities and pay PMT a sourcing fee ranging from two to three and one-half basis points on the UPB of such mortgage loans. 

During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized   net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   totaling $182.1 million and $403.8 million, respectively, increases of $99.5 million and $161.9 million from the same periods in 2015. The increase was due to growth in the volume of mortgage loans that we committed to purchase or originate and an improvement in production margins resulting from an increase in volume of our consumer direct channel, which earns higher margins than our correspondent production channel. 

Our   net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   include both cash and non-cash elements. We receive proceeds on sale that include both cash and our estimate of the fair value of the MSRs and mortgage servicing liabilities created or incurred in such transactions. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the   net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   included $144.0 million and $371.8 million, respectively, in fair value of MSRs received, net of mortgage servicing liabilities incurred. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the   net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   also included $0.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of provision for representations and warranties resulting from loan sales and a $6.6 million reduction in liability relating to mortgage loans sold in prior periods. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the   net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   included $153.3 million and $340.2 million, respectively, in fair value of MSRs received as proceeds on sale, net of mortgage servicing liabilities incurred and $2.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of provision for representations and warranties.

Our net gains on mortgage loans held for sale are summarized below: 

Provision for Losses on Representations and Warranties 

We record our estimate of the losses that we expect to incur in the future as a result of claims against us in connection with the representations and warranties we provide to the purchasers and insurers of the mortgage loans we sell in our   Net gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale at fair value  . The representations and warranties require adherence to purchaser and insurer origination and underwriting guidelines, including but not limited to the validity of the lien securing the mortgage loan, property eligibility, borrower credit, income and asset requirements, and compliance with applicable federal, state and local law. 

In the event of a breach of our representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans with identified defects or indemnify the purchaser or insurer against future credit losses. In such cases, we bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent lenders that sold such mortgage loans and breached similar or other representations and warranties. In such event, we have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from that correspondent lender.  

The method we use to estimate our losses on representations and warranties is a function of our estimate of future defaults, mortgage loan repurchase rates, the severity of loss in the event of defaults and the probability of   

66 

Table of Contents  

reimbursement by the correspondent mortgage loan seller. We establish a liability at the time loans are sold and review our liability estimate on a periodic basis.  

We recorded provisions for losses under representations and warranties as a component of   Net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value   totaling $0.9 million and $5.2 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $5.5 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in provision for losses under representations and warranties during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 was due to use of lower expected loss rates relating to current sales based, in part, on our favorable loss experience relating to similar loans originated in earlier periods, partly offset by an increase in mortgage loan sales activity during 2016 as compared to 2015. We also recorded a reduction in liabilities relating to mortgage loans sold in prior periods totaling $6.6 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016. We recorded this reduction due to our losses continuing to be realized at lower-than anticipated levels due in part to the high rate of refinancing activity resulting from the historically low interest rates in the mortgage market over recent periods. 

Following is a summary of mortgage loan repurchase and loss activity and the UPB of mortgage loans subject to representations and warranties: 

During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased mortgage loans totaling $2.1 million and $13.5 million in UPB, respectively. We recorded losses of $8,000 and $710,000 respectively net of   

67 

Table of Contents  

recoveries from correspondent lenders, as a result of these repurchases. As the outstanding balance of mortgage loans we purchase and sell subject to representations and warranties increases and the loans sold continue to season, we expect the level of repurchase activity to continue to increase.  

The level of the liability for losses under representations and warranties is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgment. The level of mortgage loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors, purchaser or insurer loss mitigation strategies, and other external conditions that may change over the lives of the underlying mortgage loans. Our estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is developed by our credit   administration staff   and approved by our senior management credit committee which   includes our senior executives and senior management in our loan production, loan servicing and credit risk management areas.      

Our representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits of exposure. However, we believe that the current UPB of mortgage loans sold by us to date represents the maximum exposure to repurchases related to representations and warranties.  

Other mortgage loan production-related revenues 

Mortgage loan origination fees increased $5.2 million and $15.4 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to growth in the volume of correspondent purchases in our loan production activities.  

Fulfillment fees from PMT, which represent fees we collect for services we perform on behalf of PMT in connection with its acquisition, packaging and sale of mortgage loans, are calculated as a percentage of the UPB of the mortgage loans we fulfill for PMT. Fulfillment fees increased $9.7 million and $13.5 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.  The effect of the increase in volume of mortgage loans we fulfilled for PMT was partially offset by a reduction in the average fulfillment fee rate we charged during 2016 as compared to 2015. 

Summarized below are our fulfillment fees:

Following is a summary of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio in UPB: 

Net mortgage loan servicing fees decreased approximately $11.4 million and $62.6 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015,   primarily due to the effect on net mortgage loan servicing fees of fair value driven adjustments recognized during 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by an increase in mortgage loan servicing fees resulting from a larger portfolio. The lower interest rates that have prevailed through much of 2016 as well as higher costs of capital for the primary purchasers of government MSRs had a negative effect on the fair value of our MSRs. As a result, we recognized fair value adjustments net of hedging results totaling $15.9 million and $103.7 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $7.2 million and $20.3 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Amortization and realization of cash flows also increased by $19.3 million and $67.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the periods ended September 30, 2015. These increases reflect both growth in our investment in MSRs and acceleration of amortization owing to a shortened expected life as interest rates have declined. These adjustments were partially offset by increased servicing fees from growth in our mortgage loan servicing portfolio.

Management fees and Carried Interest 

Management fees and Carried Interest are summarized below:

Table of Contents  

Management fees from PMT decreased $717,000 and $2.9 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to: 

a decrease in base management fees of $717,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, due primarily to the effect of a share repurchase program on PMT s shareholders  equity upon which its base management fee is based; and     

a decrease in performance incentive fees resulting from a decline in PMT s financial performance over the four-quarter period upon which the incentive fees were calculated.     

Management fees from the Investment Funds decreased $218,000 and $1.8 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Investment Funds  net asset values as a result of continued distributions to the Investment Funds  investors following the end of the Investment Funds  commitment period.   

Carried Interest from Investment Funds decreased $1.4 million and $2.0 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. 

Other revenues 

Net interest expense decreased $1.1 million and increased $5.2 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The $1.1 million decrease is primarily due to an increase in interest income on mortgage loans held for sale as a result of an increase in mortgage loan inventory and an increase in the placement fees we receive relating to the custodial funds that we manage, partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from asset growth and increased borrowing costs. The $5.2 million increase is primarily due to increased leverage and increased interest expense on mortgage loan prepayments.  

Change in fair value of investment in and dividends received from PMT   increased $145,000 and $425,000 during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 due to improved price performance in our investment in PMT. We held 75,000 common shares of PMT during each of the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, with fair value of $1.2 million at the end of each period. 

Expenses 

Our compensation expense is summarized below: 

Compensation expense increased $22.0 million and $44.9 million, during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to the growth in our mortgage banking segments. 

Incentive compensation increased primarily due to higher attainment of profitability targets during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015.   

Servicing expense increased $5.4 million and $1.4 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.    The increase was primarily due to the growth in our MSR portfolio during 2016 as compared to 2015. 

71 

Table of Contents  

Technology expense increased $3.1 million and $6.2 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to increased software costs as part of our continued investment in loan production and servicing infrastructure. 

Expenses Allocated to PMT 

We are reimbursed by PMT for other expenses, including common overhead expenses we have incurred on PMT s behalf, in accordance with the terms of our management agreement with PMT.  We present the expense amounts in the consolidated statements of income net of these allocations.  

Common overhead expense amounts allocated to PMT during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below: 

Provision for Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rates were 12.2% and 12.0% during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 11.6% and 11.5% during the same periods in 2015. The difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate is primarily due to the allocation of earnings to the noncontrolling interest unitholders. As the noncontrolling interest unitholders convert their ownership units into our shares, we expect an increase in allocated earnings that will be subject to corporate federal and state statutory tax rates, which will in turn increase our effective income tax rate.

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Following is a summary of key balance sheet items as of the dates presented: 

Total assets increased $2.1 billion from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2015 to $5.6 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 billion in mortgage loans held for sale at fair value, resulting from growth in our mortgage loan production. 

Total liabilities increased by $1.9 billion from $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 to $4.3 billion as of September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in borrowings to fund growth in our inventory of mortgage loans held for sale at fair value and MSRs. 

Cash Flows 

Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below: 

Our cash flows resulted in a net decrease in cash of $10.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as discussed below.  

Operating activities 

Net cash used in operating activities totaled $1.9 billion and $519.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to the growth of our inventory of mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. 

73 

Table of Contents  

Investing activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $98.7 million primarily due to $173.7 million in net settlements of derivative financial instruments used in our hedging of MSRs, partially offset by acquisitions of fixed assets and capitalized software. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $538.2 million primarily due to our purchase of MSRs and advances on a note receivable from PMT that we made during the period. 

Financing activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash was provided primarily to finance the growth in our inventory of mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash was provided primarily to finance mortgage loan inventory and mortgage servicing rights. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity reflects our ability to meet our current obligations (including our operating expenses and, when applicable, the retirement of, and margin calls relating to, our debt, margin calls relating to hedges, and tax distributions to noncontrolling interest holders), fund new originations and purchases, and make investments as we identify them. We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be through cash flows from business activities, proceeds from borrowings and/or additional equity offerings. We believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs. 

Our current leverage strategy is to finance our assets where we believe such borrowing is prudent, appropriate and available. Our borrowing activities are in the form of assets sold under agreements to repurchase, sales of mortgage loan participation certificates, a note payable, a revolving credit agreement, ESS and a capital lease. All of our borrowings other than ESS and the capital lease have short-term maturities and provide for terms of approximately one year. We will continue to finance most of our assets on a short-term basis until longer-term financing becomes more available.     Because a significant portion of our current debt facilities consists of short-term borrowings, we expect to renew these facilities in advance of their maturity dates in order to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital or otherwise allow ourselves sufficient time to replace any necessary financing. 

Our repurchase agreements represent the sales of assets together with agreements for us to buy back the respective assets at a later date. The table below presents the average outstanding, maximum and ending balances: 

Our secured financing agreements at PLS require us to comply with various financial covenants. The most significant financial covenants specific to PLS currently include the following: 

positive net income during each calendar quarter;     

a minimum in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $20 million;     

a minimum tangible net worth of $200 million;     

a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of 10:1; and     

at least one other warehouse or repurchase facility that finances amounts and assets similar to those being financed under one of our existing secured financing agreements.     

74 

Table of Contents  

With respect to servicing performed for PMT, PLS is also subject to certain covenants under its debt agreements. Covenants of PLS in PMT s debt agreements are at least equal to, or less restrictive, than the covenants described above. 

In addition to the covenants noted above, our revolving credit agreement (classified as a note payable) and capital lease contain additional financial covenants specific to PennyMac including, but not limited to, 

a minimum of cash and carried interest equal to the amount borrowed under the revolving credit agreement;     

a minimum of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents equal to $25 million;     

a minimum tangible net worth of $500 million;     

a minimum asset coverage ratio (the ratio of the total asset amount to the total commitment) of 2.5; and     

a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio of 5:1.     

Although these financial covenants limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and affect our liquidity through minimum cash reserve requirements, we believe that these covenants currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to successfully operate our business and obtain the financing necessary to achieve that purpose. 

Our debt financing agreements also contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender at its option, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. A margin deficit will generally result from any decline in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to the related financing agreement. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice. 

We are also subject to liquidity and net worth requirements established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) and Ginnie Mae for Agency seller/servicers. Effective December 31, 2015, FHFA and Ginnie Mae have established new minimum liquidity requirements and revised their net worth requirements for their approved non-depository single-family sellers/servicers in the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae for its approved single-family issuers, as summarized below: 

FHFA liquidity requirement is equal to 0.035% (3.5 basis points) of total Agency servicing UPB plus an incremental 200 basis points of the amount by which total nonperforming Agency servicing UPB exceeds 6% of the applicable Agency servicing UPB; allowable assets to satisfy liquidity requirement include cash and cash equivalents (unrestricted), certain investment-grade securities that are available for sale or held for trading including Agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and U.S. Treasury obligations, and unused and available portions of committed servicing advance lines;     

FHFA net worth requirement is a tangible net worth/total assets ratio greater than or equal to 6%;     

Ginnie Mae single-family issuer minimum liquidity requirement is equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the issuer s outstanding Ginnie Mae single-family securities, which must be met with cash and cash equivalents; and     

Ginnie Mae net worth requirement is equal to $2.5 million plus 0.35% (35 basis points) of the issuer s outstanding Ginnie Mae single-family obligations.     

We believe that we are currently in compliance with the applicable Agency requirements. 

We have purchased portfolios of MSRs and have financed them in part through the sale to PMT of the right to receive ESS. The outstanding amount of the ESS financing is based on the current valuation of such ESS and amounts received on the underlying mortgage loans.  

75 

Table of Contents  

We continue to explore a variety of means of financing our continued growth, including debt financing through bank warehouse lines of credit, bank loans, repurchase agreements, securitization transactions and corporate debt. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or whether such efforts will be successful. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees 

As of September 30, 2016, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or guarantees. 

Contractual Obligations 

As of September 30, 2016, we had on-balance commitments to purchase and originate mortgage loans of $4.7 billion, contractual obligations of $2.5 billion to finance assets under agreements to repurchase, $782.9 million to finance assets under our mortgage loan participation and sale agreement, $111 million of notes payable, $280.4 million of ESS transactions and a capital lease transaction secured by certain fixed assets and capitalized software with an outstanding balance of $20.7 million.  We also lease our primary office facilities under an agreement that expires on April 30, 2026 and we license certain software to support our loan servicing operations.  

All debt financing arrangements that matured between September 30, 2016 and the date of this Report have been renewed or extended.  Payment obligations under these agreements are summarized below: 

(1) 

The ESS financing obligation payable to PMT does not have a stated contractual maturity date and will pay down as the underlying MSRs receive the excess servicing fee rate due to PMT.     

(2) 

Software licenses include both volume and activity based fees that are dependent on the number of loans serviced during each period and include a base fee of approximately $1.1 million per month. Estimated payments for software licenses above are based on the number of loans currently serviced by us, which totaled approximately 953,000 at September 30, 2016. Future amounts due may significantly fluctuate based on changes in the number of loans serviced by us. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, software license fees totaled $10.4 million. All figures contained in this footnote are in actual amounts and not in thousands (in contrast to the table above).

Management Agreements 

PMT Management Agreement 

We externally manage and advise PMT pursuant to a management agreement. Our management agreement with PMT requires us to oversee PMT s business affairs in conformity with the investment policies that are approved and monitored by its board of trustees. We are responsible for PMT s day-to-day management and perform such services and activities related to PMT s assets and operations as may be appropriate. Pursuant to our management agreement, we collect a base management fee and may collect a performance incentive fee. 

Pursuant to our management agreement, we collect a base management fee and may collect a performance incentive fee, both payable quarterly in arrears.  The management agreement, as amended and restated, expires on September 12, 2020, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  

The base management fee is calculated at a defined annualized percentage of  shareholders  equity.  PMT s  shareholders  equity  is defined as the sum of the net proceeds from any issuances of its equity securities since inception (weighted for the time outstanding during the measurement period); plus its retained earnings at the end of the quarter; less any amount that PMT pays for repurchases of its common shares (weighted for the time held during the measurement period); and excluding one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non     cash charges after discussions between PCM and PMT s independent trustees and approval by a majority of PMT s independent trustees.  

Pursuant to the management agreement, the base management fee is equal to the sum of (i) 1.5% per year of PMT s shareholders  equity up to $2 billion, (ii) 1.375% per year of shareholders  equity in excess of $2 billion and up to $5 billion, and (iii) 1.25% per year of PMT s shareholders  equity in excess of $5 billion. The base management fee is paid in cash.  

The performance incentive fee is calculated as a defined percentage of the amount by which PMT s  net income,  on a rolling four-quarter basis and before deducting the incentive fee, exceeds certain levels of annualized return on PMT s  equity amount.  For purposes of determining the amount of the performance incentive fee,  net income  is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non     cash charges determined after discussions between PCM and PMT s independent trustees and approval by a majority of PMT s independent trustees. For this purpose,  equity amount  is the weighted average of the issue price per common share of all of PMT s public offerings of common shares, multiplied by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (including restricted share units issued under PMT s equity incentive plans) in the four-quarter period.  

77 

Table of Contents  

The performance incentive fee is calculated quarterly and escalates as net income (stated as a percentage return on equity) increases over certain thresholds. On each calculation date, the threshold amount represents a stated return on equity, plus or minus a  high watermark  adjustment. The performance fee payable for any quarter is equal to: (a) 10% of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds (i) an 8% return on equity plus the high watermark, up to (ii) a 12% return on equity; plus (b) 15% of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds (i) a 12% return on equity plus the high watermark, up to (ii) a 16% return on equity; plus (c) 20% of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds a 16% return on equity plus the high watermark.  

The  high watermark  is the quarterly adjustment that reflects the amount by which the net income (stated as a percentage of return on equity) in that quarter exceeds or falls short of the lesser of 8% and the Fannie Mae MBS Yield (the target yield) for such quarter. If the net income is lower than the target yield, the high watermark is increased by the difference. If the net income is higher than the target yield, the high watermark is reduced by the difference. Each time a performance incentive fee is earned, the high watermark returns to zero. As a result, the threshold amount required for PCM to earn a performance incentive fee is adjusted cumulatively based on the performance of PMT s net income over (or under) the target yield, until the net income in excess of the target yield exceeds the then-current cumulative high watermark amount, and a performance incentive fee is earned. The performance incentive fee may be paid in cash or in PMT common shares (subject to a limit of no more than 50% paid in common shares), at PMT s option.  

Under the management agreement, PCM is entitled to reimbursement of its organizational and operating expenses, including third-party expenses, incurred on PMT s behalf, it being understood that PCM and its affiliates shall allocate a portion of their personnel s time to provide certain legal, tax and investor relations services for the direct benefit of PMT and for which PCM shall be reimbursed $120,000 per fiscal quarter, such amount to be reviewed annually and not preclude reimbursement for any other services performed by PCM or its affiliates.  

In addition, PMT is required to pay its and its subsidiaries  pro rata portion of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of PCM and its affiliates required for PMT s and its subsidiaries  operations. These expenses will be allocated based on the ratio of PMT s and its subsidiaries  proportion of gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets managed by PCM as calculated at each fiscal quarter end.  

Under the management agreement, PCM may be entitled to a termination fee under certain circumstances. Specifically, the termination fee is payable for (1) PMT s termination of the management agreement without cause, (2) PCM s termination of the management agreement upon a default by PMT in the performance of any material term of the agreement that has continued uncured for a period of 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof, or (3) PCM s termination of the agreement after the termination by PMT without cause (excluding a non-renewal) of the MBS agreement, the MSR recapture agreement, or the servicing agreement (each as described and/or defined below). The termination fee is equal to three times the sum of (a) the average annual base management fee, and (b) the average annual (or, if the period is less than 24 months, annualized) performance incentive fee earned by PCM during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of termination.  

PMT may terminate the management agreement without the payment of any termination fee under certain circumstances, including, among other circumstances, uncured material breaches by PCM of the management agreement, upon a change in control of PCM (defined to include a 50% change in the shareholding of PCM in a single transaction or related series of transactions or Mr. Stanford L. Kurland s failure to continue as chief executive officer of PCM to the extent his suitable replacement (in PMT s discretion) has not been retained by PCM within six months thereof) or upon the termination of the MBS agreement, the MSR recapture agreement or the servicing agreement by PLS without cause.  

The management agreement also provides that, prior to the undertaking by PCM or its affiliates of any new investment opportunity or any other business opportunity requiring a source of capital with respect to which PCM or its affiliates will earn a management, advisory, consulting or similar fee, PCM shall present to PMT such new opportunity and the material terms on which PCM proposes to provide services to PMT before pursuing such opportunity with third parties.

Investment Funds Management Agreements 

We have investment management agreements with the Investment Funds pursuant to which we receive management fees consisting of base management fees and Carried Interest.   The limited liability company and limited partnership agreements of the Investment Funds specify that the funds will continue in existence through December 31, 2016, subject to three one-year extensions by PCM at its discretion. PCM has elected to extend the relevant agreements of the Investment Funds for the first of such three one-year extensions. 

Loan Servicing Agreements 

PMT Loan Servicing Agreement 

Pursuant to a loan servicing agreement with PMT, PLS provides servicing for PMT s portfolio of  residential mortgage loans and subservicing for its portfolio of MSRs.  Such servicing and subservicing provided by PLS includes collecting principal, interest and escrow account payments, if any, with respect to mortgage loans, as well as managing loss mitigation, which may include, among other things, collection activities, loan workouts, modifications, foreclosures and short sales. PLS also engages in certain loan origination activities that include refinancing mortgage loans and financings that facilitate sales of REO. The servicing agreement expires on September 12, 2020, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 

The base servicing fee rates for distressed whole mortgage loans are charged based on a monthly per-loan dollar amount, with the actual dollar amount for each loan based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and/or foreclosure status of such loan or whether the underlying mortgage property has become REO. The base servicing fee rates for distressed whole mortgage loans range from $30 per month for current loans up to $100 per month for loans where the borrower has declared bankruptcy. The base servicing fee rate for REO is $75 per month. To the extent that we facilitate rentals of PMT's REO under its REO rental program, we collect an REO rental fee of $30 per month per REO, an REO property lease renewal fee of $100 per lease renewal, and a property management fee in an amount equal to our cost if property management services and/or any related software costs are outsourced to a third-party property management firm or 9% of gross rental income if we provide property management services directly. We are also entitled to retain any tenant paid application fees and late rent fees and seek reimbursement for certain third-party vendor fees. 

We are also entitled to certain activity-based fees for distressed whole mortgage loans that are charged based on the achievement of certain events.  These fees range from 0.50% for a streamline modification to 1.50% for a liquidation and $500 for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.  We are not entitled to earn more than one liquidation fee, reperformance fee or modification fee in any 18-month period. 

In addition, because PMT has limited employees and infrastructure, PLS is required to provide a range of services and activities significantly greater in scope than the services provided in connection with a customary servicing arrangement. For these services, PLS receives a supplemental servicing fee of $25 per month for each distressed whole loan. PLS is entitled to reimbursement for all customary, good faith reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by PLS in performance of its servicing obligations. 

Except as otherwise provided in the MSR recapture agreement, when PLS effects a refinancing of a loan on behalf of PMT and not through a third-party lender and the resulting loan is readily saleable, or PLS originates a loan to facilitate the disposition of the real estate acquired by PMT in settlement of a loan, PLS is entitled to receive from PMT market-based fees and compensation consistent with pricing and terms PLS offers unaffiliated third parties on a retail basis. 

We, on behalf of PMT, currently participate in HAMP (or other similar mortgage loan modification programs). HAMP establishes standard loan modification guidelines for  at risk  homeowners and provides incentive payments to certain participants, including mortgage loan servicers, for achieving modifications and successfully remaining in the program. The mortgage loan servicing agreement entitles PLS to retain any incentive payments made to it and to which it is entitled under HAMP; provided, however, that with respect to any such incentive payments paid to PLS in connection with a mortgage loan modification for which PMT previously paid PLS a modification fee, PLS is required to reimburse PMT an amount equal to the incentive payments.

PLS continues to be entitled to reimbursement for all customary, bona fide reasonable and necessary out     of     pocket expenses incurred by PLS in connection with the performance of its servicing obligations. 

Investment Funds Loan Servicing Agreements 

We have also entered into loan servicing agreements with the Investment Funds. Our servicing agreements with the Investment Funds generally provide for fee revenue, which varies depending on the type and quality of the loans being serviced. We are also entitled to certain customary market-based fees and charges. This arrangement was modified, effective January 1, 2012, with respect to one of the Investment Funds. At that time, we settled our accrued servicing fee rebate and amended our servicing agreement with such fund to charge scheduled servicing fees in place of the previous  at cost  servicing arrangement. 

Mortgage Banking Services Agreement 

Pursuant to a mortgage banking services agreement (the  MBS agreement ),PLS provides PMT with certain mortgage banking services, including fulfillment and disposition-related services, with respect to loans acquired by PMT from correspondent lenders. Pursuant to the MBS agreement, PLS has agreed to provide such services exclusively for the benefit of PMT, and PLS and its affiliates are prohibited from providing such services for any other third party. However, such exclusivity and prohibition shall not apply, and certain other duties instead will be imposed upon PLS, if PMT is unable to purchase or finance mortgage loans as contemplated under the MBS agreement for any reason. The MBS agreement expires on September 12, 2020, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 

In consideration for the mortgage banking services provided by PLS with respect to PMT s acquisition of mortgage loans, PLS is entitled to a fulfillment fee based on the type of mortgage loan that PMT acquires and equal to a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of such mortgage loan. The applicable percentages are (i) 0.35% for mortgage loans sold or delivered to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and (ii) 0.85% for all other mortgage loans; provided however, that no fulfillment fee shall be due or payable to PLS with respect to any Ginnie Mae mortgage loans. PMT does not hold the Ginnie Mae approval required to issue Ginnie Mae MBS and act as a servicer. Accordingly, under the MBS agreement, PLS currently purchases mortgage loans underwritten in accordance with the Ginnie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide  as is  and without recourse of any kind from PMT at PMT s cost less an administrative fee plus accrued interest and a sourcing fee ranging from two to three and one-half basis points, generally based on the average number of calendar days mortgage loans are held by PMT prior to purchase by PLS. 

In consideration for the mortgage banking services provided by PLS with respect to PMT s acquisition of mortgage loans under PLS  early purchase program, PLS is entitled to fees accruing (i) at a rate equal to $1,500 per year per early purchase facility administered by PLS, and (ii) in the amount of $35 for each mortgage loan that PMT acquires thereunder. 

Notwithstanding any provision of the MBS agreement to the contrary, if it becomes reasonably necessary or advisable for PLS to engage in additional services in connection with post-breach or post-default resolution activities for the purposes of a correspondent agreement, then PMT has generally agreed with PLS to negotiate in good faith for additional compensation and reimbursement of expenses to be paid to PLS for the performance of such additional services. 

MSR Recapture Agreement 

Pursuant to the terms of a MSR recapture agreement, as amended, if PLS refinances through its consumer direct lending business mortgage loans for which PMT previously held the MSRs, PLS is generally required to transfer and convey to PMT, without cost to PMT, MSRs with respect to new mortgage loans originated in those refinancings (or, under certain circumstances, other mortgage loans) that have an aggregate unpaid principal balance that is not less than 30% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all such mortgage loans so originated. Where the fair market value of the aggregate MSRs to be transferred for the applicable month is less than $200,000, PLS may, at its option, wire to PMT cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of the MSRs in lieu of transferring such MSRs. The MSR recapture agreement expires on September 12, 2020, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

Spread Acquisition and MSR Servicing Agreements 

Effective February 1, 2013, we entered into a master spread acquisition and MSR servicing agreement (the  2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement ), pursuant to which we previously sold to PMT or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries the rights to receive certain ESS from MSRs acquired by us from banks and other third party financial institutions. We were generally required to service or subservice the related mortgage loans for the applicable agency or investor. We only used the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement for the purpose of selling ESS relating to Fannie Mae MSRs. The specific terms of each transaction under the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement were subject to the terms thereof, as modified and supplemented by the terms of a confirmation executed in connection with such transaction. 

To the extent we refinanced any of the mortgage loans relating to the ESS sold to PMT, the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement contained recapture provisions requiring that we transfer to PMT, at no cost, the ESS relating to a certain percentage of the UPB of the newly originated mortgage loans. To the extent the fair value of the aggregate ESS to be transferred for the applicable month was less than $200,000, we were, at our option, permitted to pay cash to PMT in an amount equal to such fair value instead of transferring such ESS.  

On February 29, 2016, the parties terminated the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement and all amendments thereto. In connection with the termination of the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement, we reacquired from PMT all of its right, title and interest in and to all of the Fannie Mae ESS previously sold by us to PMT and then subject to such 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement. 

On December 19, 2014, we entered into a second master spread acquisition and MSR servicing agreement with PMT (the  12/19/14 Spread Acquisition Agreement ). The terms of the 12/19/14 Spread Acquisition Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement, except that we only intend to sell ESS relating to Freddie Mac MSRs under the 12/19/14 Spread Acquisition Agreement. 

To the extent we refinance any of the mortgage loans relating to the ESS we sell to PMT, the 12/19/14 Spread Acquisition Agreement also contains recapture provisions requiring that we transfer to PMT, at no cost, the ESS relating to a certain percentage of the UPB of the newly originated mortgage loans. To the extent the fair market value of the aggregate ESS to be transferred for the applicable month is less than $200,000, we may, at our option, pay cash to PMT in an amount equal to such fair market value in lieu of transferring such ESS. 

On February 29, 2016, we reacquired from PMT all of its right, title and interest in and to all of the Freddie Mae ESS previously sold by us to PMT and then subject to such 12/19/14 Spread Acquisition Agreement. The 12/19/14 Spread Acquisition Agreement remains in full force and effect. 

On April 30, 2015, we amended and restated a third master spread acquisition and MSR servicing agreement with PMT (the  4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement ). The terms of the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement and the 12/19/14 Spread Acquisition Agreement, except that we only intend to sell ESS relating to Ginnie Mae MSRs under the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement. The primary purpose of the amendment and restatement to the 4/30/15 Spread Agreement was to evidence the ownership of the ESS under participation certificates and to otherwise incorporate the terms of previously executed amendments.  

To the extent we refinance any of the mortgage loans relating to the ESS we sell to PMT, the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement also contains recapture provisions requiring that we transfer to PMT, at no cost, the ESS relating to a certain percentage of the UPB of the newly originated mortgage loans. However, under the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement, in any month where the transferred ESS relating to newly originated Ginnie Mae mortgage loans is not equivalent to at least 90% of the product of the excess servicing fee rate and the UPB of the refinanced mortgage loans, we are also required to transfer additional ESS or cash in the amount of such shortfall. Similarly, in any month where the transferred ESS relating to modified Ginnie Mae mortgage loans is not equivalent to at least 90% of the product of the excess servicing fee rate and the UPB of the modified mortgage loans, the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement contains provisions that require us to transfer additional ESS or cash in the amount of such shortfall. To the extent the fair value of the aggregate ESS to be transferred for the applicable month is less than $200,000, we may, at our option, pay cash to PMT in an amount equal to such fair value instead of transferring such ESS.

Table of Contents  

In connection with our entry into the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement, we were also required to (i) amend and restate the terms of a loan and security agreement (the  LSA ) with Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital LLC ( CSFB ), pursuant to which we pledged to CSFB all of our rights and interests in the Ginnie Mae MSRs we own or acquire, enabling us to finance certain of such MSRs and servicing advance receivables, and (ii) enter into a separate acknowledgement agreement with respect thereto, by and among Ginnie Mae, CSFB and us. Under the terms of the amendment and restatement to the LSA, the maximum loan amount was increased from $257 million to $407 million. The $150 million increase was implemented for the purpose of facilitating the financing of ESS by PMT. On November 10, 2015, the LSA was further amended and restated to convert the form of the borrowing into a repurchase agreement (as amended and restated, the  MSR Repo ). The aggregate loan amount outstanding under the MSR Repo and relating to advances outstanding with PMT is guaranteed in full by PMT. 

Separately, as a condition to permitting us to transfer to PMT the ESS relating to a portion of our pledged Ginnie Mae MSRs, CSFB required PMT to enter into a Security and Subordination Agreement (the  Security Agreement ), pursuant to which PMT pledged to CSFB its rights under the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement and its interest in any ESS purchased thereunder. CSFB s lien on the ESS remains subordinate to the rights and interests of Ginnie Mae pursuant to the provisions of the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement and the terms of the acknowledgement agreement. 

The Security Agreement permits CSFB to liquidate PMT s ESS along with the related MSRs to the extent there exists an event of default under the MSR Repo, and it contains certain trigger events, including breaches of representations, warranties or covenants and defaults under other of PMT s credit facilities, that would require us to either (i) repay in full the outstanding loan amount under the MSR Repo or (ii) repurchase the ESS from PMT at fair value. To the extent we are unable to repay the loan under the MSR Repo or repurchase the ESS, an event of default would exist under the MSR Repo, thereby entitling CSFB to liquidate the ESS and the related MSRs. In the event the ESS is liquidated as a result of certain actions or inactions by us, PMT generally would be entitled to seek indemnity from us under the 4/30/15 Spread Acquisition Agreement.  

Note Receivable from PMT 

In connection with certain of the amendments and restatements described above, we entered into an underlying loan and security agreement with PMT, dated as of April 30, 2015, and as further amended pursuant to which PMT may borrow up to $150 million from us for the purpose of financing ESS (the  Underlying LSA ).  

The principal amount of the borrowings under the Underlying LSA is based upon a percentage of the market value of the ESS pledged by PMT, subject to the $150 million sublimit described above. Pursuant to the Underlying LSA, PMT granted us a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the ESS pledged to secure the borrowings. 

We have agreed with PMT in connection with the Underlying LSA that PMT is required to repay us the principal amount of borrowings plus accrued interest to the date of such repayment, and we are required, in turn, to repay CSFB the corresponding amount under the MSR Repo. Interest accrues on the note receivable from PMT relating to the Underlying LSA at a rate based on CSFB s cost of funds under the MSR Repo. PMT was also required to pay us a fee for the structuring of the Underlying LSA in an amount equal to the portion of the corresponding fee paid by us to CSFB allocable to the increase in the maximum loan amount under the MSR Repo resulting from the ESS financing.  

Loan Purchase Agreements 

We have entered into a mortgage loan purchase agreement and a flow commercial mortgage loan purchase agreement with PMT. Currently, we use the mortgage loan purchase agreement for the purpose of selling to PMT prime jumbo residential mortgage loans and conventional mortgage loans eligible for delivery into Agency credit risk transfer securities, in each case originated by us through our consumer direct lending business. We use the flow commercial mortgage loan purchase agreement for the purpose of selling to PMT small balance commercial mortgage loans, including multifamily mortgage loans, originated by us as part of our commercial lending business. Each of the loan purchase agreements contains customary terms and provisions, including representations and warranties, covenants, repurchase remedies and indemnities. The purchase prices paid to us by PMT for such loans are market-based.

Commercial Mortgage Servicing Oversight Agreement 

We have also entered into a commercial mortgage servicing oversight agreement with PMT that governs our oversight of the master and/or special servicing performed by third party servicers in connection with certain commercial mortgage loans acquired by PMT. For the oversight services performed under this agreement, we are entitled to collect a fee equal to 5 basis points per annum based on the UPB of the related commercial mortgage loans for which we provide oversight servicing. 

Reimbursement Agreement 

In connection with the IPO of PMT s common shares on August 4, 2009, we entered into an agreement with PMT pursuant to which PMT agreed to reimburse us for the $2.9 million payment that it made to the underwriters in such offering (the  Conditional Reimbursement ) if PMT satisfied certain performance measures over a specified period of time. Effective February 1, 2013, the parties amended the terms of the reimbursement agreement to provide for the reimbursement to us of the Conditional Reimbursement if PMT is required to pay us performance incentive fees under the management agreement at a rate of $10 in reimbursement for every $100 of performance incentive fees earned. The reimbursement of the Conditional Reimbursement is subject to a maximum reimbursement in any particular 12 month period of $1.0 million and the maximum amount that may be reimbursed under the agreement is $2.9 million. 

In the event the termination fee is payable to us under the management agreement and we have not received the full amount of the reimbursements and payments under the reimbursement agreement, such amount will be paid in full. The term of the reimbursement agreement expires on February 1, 2019. 

Debt Obligations 

As described further above in  Liquidity and Capital Resources,  we currently finance certain of our assets through borrowings with major financial institution counterparties in the form of sales of assets under agreements to repurchase, mortgage loan participation and sale agreements, two notes payable, ESS and a capital lease. The borrower under each of these facilities is PLS with the exception of the revolving credit agreement, which is classified as a note payable, and the capital lease, in each case where the borrower is PennyMac. All PLS obligations as previously noted are guaranteed by PennyMac. 

Under the terms of these agreements, PLS is required to comply with certain financial covenants, as described further above in  Liquidity and Capital Resources,  and various non-financial covenants customary for transactions of this nature. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance in all material respects with these covenants. 

The agreements also contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice. 

In addition, the agreements contain events of default (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods), including payment defaults, breaches of covenants and/or certain representations and warranties, cross-defaults, guarantor defaults, servicer termination events and defaults, material adverse changes, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and other events of default customary for these types of transactions. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for these types of transactions and include the acceleration of the principal amount outstanding under the agreements and the liquidation by our lenders of the mortgage loans or other collateral then subject to the agreements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, real estate values and other market based risks. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, inflation risk and market value risk. 

The following sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time; only contemplate the movements in the indicated variables; do not incorporate changes to other variables; are subject to the accuracy of various models and assumptions used; and do not incorporate other factors that would affect our overall financial performance in such scenarios, including operational adjustments made by management to account for changing circumstances. For these reasons, the following estimates should not be viewed as earnings forecasts.
