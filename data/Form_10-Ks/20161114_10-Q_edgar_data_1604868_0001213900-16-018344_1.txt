1.  
      NATURE
    OF OPERATIONS   

GrowGeneration
Corp (the  Company ) was incorporated on March 6, 2014 in Colorado under the name of Easylife and changed its name
to GrowGeneration Corp. It maintains its principal office in Pueblo, Colorado.  

GrowGeneration
Corp is engaged in the business of owning and operating retail hydroponic stores through wholly owned subsidiaries. It currently
owns Grow Generation Pueblo Corp. which operates retail hydroponic stores in Colorado located in Pueblo, Canon City, Trinidad,
Conifer, Colorado Springs and Denver, Fairplay and Castle Rock; and Grow Generation California Corp. which operates a retail store
in Santa Rosa California. The Company today owns and operates 11 stores and is actively engaged in seeking to acquire additional
hydroponic retail stores. The Company s financial statement has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and,
therefore, do not include all disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of the financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, all adjustments that are, in the opinion
of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included. Such adjustments were
of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year or any other interim period.  

2.  
      SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation   

The
Company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual method of accounting. The accounting and reporting policies of
the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements of the Company included
the accounts of GrowGeneration Pueblo Corp. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could vary from the estimates that were used.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
on product sales is recognized upon delivery or shipment. Customer deposits/layaway sales are not reported as income until final
payment is received and the merchandise is delivered.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect from balances outstanding at September 30, 2016. Based on the
Company's assessment of the credit history with customers having outstanding balances and current relationships with them. At
September 30, 2016, the Company established an allowance for doubtful accounts of $6,500.

2.  
      SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Property
and Equipment   

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterment that materially extend the life of the asset
are capitalized. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes
at rates based on the following estimated useful lives:  

Estimated
    Lives   

Vehicle  
      5
    years   

Furniture
    and fixtures  
      5-7
    years   

Computers
    and equipment  
      3-5
    years   

Leasehold
    improvements  
      10
    years   

For
federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using the accelerated cost recovery system and the modified accelerated
cost recovery system.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ACS 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred income
taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The differences
related principally to depreciation of property and equipment, reserve for obsolete inventory and bad debt. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities represent the future tax consequence for those differences, which will either be deductible or taxable when the
assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to
offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized.  

The
Company adopted the provisions of FASB ACS 740-10-25, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FASB ASC 740-10-25 also provides
guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities,
and accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions. The Company s tax returns are subject to tax examinations
by U.S. federal and state authorities until respective statute of limitation. Currently, the 2015 and 2014 tax years are open
and subject to examination by taxing authorities. However, the Company is not currently under audit nor has the Company been contacted
by any of the taxing authorities. The Company does not have any accrual for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016.
It is not anticipated that unrecognized tax benefits would significantly increase or decrease within 12 month of the reporting
date.

2.  
      SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Presentation
of Sales Taxes   

The
Company is required to collect sales tax for the State of Colorado, State of California, City of Pueblo, City of Canon City, City
of Colorado Springs, Pueblo County and Fremont County, Jefferson County, El Paso County, City   County of Denver, City of
Santa Rosa ranging from 3.9% to 8.25% on the Company's sales to nonexempt customers. The Company collects that sales tax from
customers and remits the entire amount to the corresponding taxing authorities. The Company's accounting policy is to exclude
the tax collected and remitted from revenue and cost of sales.  

Advertising   

The
Company expenses all advertising and promotional costs when incurred. Advertising and promotional expense for the nine months
ending September 30, 2016 amounted to $42,478.  

Freight
and Shipping   

It
is the Company's policy to classify freight and shipping costs as part of cost of sales. Total freight and shipping costs for
the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was $35,386.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all unrestricted highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.  

Goodwill   

Goodwill
represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with
an acquisition. The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
2014-02, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Accounting for Goodwill. provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) 2014-02, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Accounting for Goodwill. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350
for Intangibles   Goodwill and Other, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis,
or if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. The Company s review for impairment
includes an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill
impairment test is performed, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amounts, including goodwill.
If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional procedures must be performed. That
additional procedure compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The carrying
value of goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.  

Inventory   

Inventory
consists primarily of gardening supplies and materials and is recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.  

3.  
      RECENT
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance for revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 will supersede and replace nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 establishes a new
control-based revenue recognition model, changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over time or at a point of
time, provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics and expands and improves disclosures about revenue. The guidance
in ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Non public entities
are required to apply the guidance for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is not permitted for
public entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's financial
statements and disclosures.

OVERVIEW   

GrowGeneration
Corp. s mission is to become one of the largest retail hydroponic and organic specialty gardening retail outlets in the
United States. Today, GrowGeneration owns and operates a chain of ten (10) retail hydroponic/gardening stores in Colorado and
one (1) in California. GrowGeneration Corp operates its retail hydroponic stores through wholly owned subsidiaries. It currently
owns Grow Generation Pueblo Corp. which operates retail hydroponic stores in Colorado located in Pueblo, Canon City, Trinidad,
Conifer, Colorado Springs and Denver; and Grow Generation California Corp. which operates a retail store in Santa Rosa California.
The Company today owns and operates 11 stores and is actively engaged in seeking to acquire additional hydroponic retail stores.  

Our
increase in sales to date has been fueled by opening new stores and by frequent and higher dollar transactions in our stores from
commercial growers, individual home growers, and gardeners. We expect to continue to experience sales growth over the next few
years in existing stores and by increasing the number of stores that we operate, which will depend on our ability to increase
our capital. Our growth is likely to come from three distinct channels: establishing new stores in high-value markets, acquiring
existing stores with strong customer bases and strong operating histories, building a business to business sales team and the
creation of a branded e-commerce portal at www.GrowGeneration.com.  

Our
stores sell thousands of products, such as organic nutrients and soils, advanced lighting technology, state of the art hydroponic
and aquaponic equipment, and other products needed to grow indoors and outdoors. Our strategy is to target two distinct verticals,
namely i) professional growers, and ii) smaller growers who require a local store to fulfill their daily and weekly growing needs.
We are of the belief that our retail outlets provide a superior level of customer service to our customers through a well trained
staff.  

On
February 15, 2015, we opened our first non-acquired GrowGeneration store in Trinidad, Colorado. This store is 3,000 square feet
and was initially stocked with $100,000 in inventory. Our lease obligation is $1,000 per month for the next 3 years.  

In
April 2015, we acquired approximately $30,000 of inventory at cost from Green Growers, Inc., a retail store located in Canon City,
Colorado. In connection therewith, we engaged the CEO of Green Growers, Inc. as a sales consultant for a period of two years.
We pay this individual a base fee of $1,200 per month during the first year and $600 per month during the second year of his consulting
agreement, together with incentive compensation for any new business he generates, in an amount equal to 25% of the gross profit
on all such business. We also issued this consultant 10,000 three (3) year options, exercisable at a price of $.60 per share,
as additional compensation under his consulting agreement.  

In
June 2015, we acquired approximately $68,000 of inventory at cost from Happy Grow Lucky, Inc., a retail store located in Conifer,
Colorado. In connection therewith, we engaged the 2 principals as sales consultants for a period of one year. We will pay each
sales consultant $420 per month, together with incentive compensation for any new business they generate, in an amount equal to
25% of the gross profit of such business. In addition, we executed a new 3 year lease for the premises in Conifer, Colorado. at
a rate of $2,400 per month.

into a one-year agreement with one of the principals to act as a sales consultant for us for a period of one year, at a cost of
$1,000 per month. We executed a two year lease with the landlord of Sweet Leaf Hydroponics Inc. for $5,300 per month through December
2017. We also issued this consultant 25,000 three (3) year options, exercisable at a price of $.60 per share, as additional compensation
under his consulting agreement.   

On
November 28, 2015, the Company acquired $35,000 of inventory of Greenhouse Tech Inc., a retail store located in Colorado. The
Company engaged the principal of Greenhouse Tech as a sales consultant for 1 year, at $13 per hour and 20% of the gross profits
on all sales generated by sales consultant.  

On
March 1, 2016, we signed a 3 year lease, at a rate of $3,650 for the first year, 4,498 square feet, located in Denver, Colorado.  

On

31,500 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price equal to $0.70 per share, on proceeds of $315,000 raised by Cavu in connection
with the offering.  

Our
contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2016 are summarized in the table below:  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely
to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

The
application of GAAP involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  - We classify highly liquid temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less
when purchased as cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. Accounts at each institution
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. At September 30, 2016 all deposit balances were
fully insured by the FDIC. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes it is not exposed to any
significant risk for cash on deposit.  

Accounts
Receivable and Revenue -  Revenue is recognized on the sale of a product when the product is shipped, which is when the
risk of loss transfers to our customers, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collection of the sale is reasonably assured.
A product is not shipped without an order from the customer and the completion of credit acceptance procedures. The majority of
our sales are cash or credit card; however, we occasionally extend terms to our customers. Accounts receivable are reviewed periodically
for collectability.  

Inventories
-  Inventories are recorded on a first in first out basis. Inventory consists of raw materials, purchased finished goods
and components held for resale. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. The reserve for obsolete inventory was $52,000
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Property
and Equipment -  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets acquired held under capital leases are initially recorded
at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments discounted at the implicit interest rate (8% for assets currently
held under capital lease) or the fair value of the asset. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life based
on the particular asset. Assets acquired under capital lease are depreciated over the lesser of the useful life or the lease term.
At the time of retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.  

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets -  We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets during the
fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited
to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, (3) an adverse action
or assessment by a regulator, (4) continued losses from operations, (5) continued negative cash flows from operations, and (6)
the suspension of trading of the Company s securities. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, we compare the fair
value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill.
The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the
market approach, which utilizes comparable companies  data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied
fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill,
the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair
values. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied
fair value of goodwill.  

The
result of our 2015 annual goodwill impairment testing validates that the value of the goodwill has not been impaired as of December
31, 2015. The Company based its testing on the following factors:  

1.
Our stores which we purchased in 2014 began operations in 2008;  

  2.
The stores grew from 1-4 stores from 2008-2014 and at the end of 2015, we had 8 total stores;  

  3.
A loyal customer base expanded in 2015;  

  4.
A list of reliable suppliers are all in good standing; and  

  5.
Our business is growing and expanding.  

Long
Lived Assets    We reviews our long-lived assets for impairment annually or when changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential
to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (less the projected cost associated with selling the
asset). To the extent carrying values exceed fair values, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.  

Fair
Value Measurements and Financial Instruments -  ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements
for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or
liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:  

Level 1
- Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

Level 2
- Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  

Level 3
- Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.  

The
carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, investment in a related party, accounts payables, accrued expenses, due to related
party, notes payable, and convertible notes approximates their fair values due to their short-term maturities.  

Derivative
financial instruments -  We evaluate all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives
or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities,
the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in
the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company
uses a weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent
valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance
sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within
twelve months of the balance sheet date.  

Stock
Based Compensation    We have share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors
may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at the fair market value
at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by us at the grant date, based on the fair value
of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718. For options issued to employees, we recognize stock compensation
costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.  Grants of stock to non-employees and
other parties are accounted for in accordance with the ASC 505.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Management
maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange
Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016.  

Based
on that evaluation, management concluded, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016
in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting subsequent
to the date of management s last evaluation.
