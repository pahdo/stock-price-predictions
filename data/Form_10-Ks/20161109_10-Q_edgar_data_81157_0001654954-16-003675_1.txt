(1) Basis of
Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of PGI Incorporated ( PGI ) and its subsidiaries (the
 Company ) have been prepared in accordance with the
instructions to Form 10 - Q and therefore do not include all
disclosures necessary for fair presentation of financial position,
results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. The Company's independent
registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph
regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in
their opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in the
Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed
or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form
10-K annual report for 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December
31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance
sheet as of that date. 

Sugarmill Woods,
Inc. ( Sugarmill Woods ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PGI, entered into two contracts with the State of Florida
Department of Transportation (the  Florida DOT ) for
the sale of Sugarmill Woods  principal real property asset
consisting of approximately 369 acres located in Hernando County,
Florida (the  Property ) for $9 million. The signatures
from the Florida DOT required to make the two contracts effective
were obtained on June 17, 2016, and the sale was closed on June 21,
2016. 

The
proceeds from the sale of the Property of $9 million were received
on June 23, 2016 and payment of the primary debt obligation,
including all accrued interest payable to related party totaling
$970,000, was made to PGIP LLC ( PGIP ), the holder of
the first mortgage note and an affiliate of the Company. In
addition, on June 23, 2016, the remaining principal of the
convertible debentures payable to related parties totaling
$1,500,000 was paid and a portion of the related accrued interest
totaling $5,455,000 was paid to the current holders of such
debentures. Love Investment Company ( LIC ), an
affiliate of Love-PGI Partners, L.P. ( L-PGI ), the
Company s primary preferred stock shareholder and Love-1989
Florida Partners ( Love-1989 ), also an affiliate of
L-PGI, held the convertible debentures. 

The
Company remains in default under the indentures governing its
unsecured subordinated debentures. (See Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes
7, 8, and 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2015, as contained in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10 - K). 

All
adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals)
necessary for fair presentation of financial position, results of
operations and cash flows have been made. The results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of operations to be expected for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2016 or any other interim period.

(2) Per
Share Data 

Basic
per share amounts are computed by dividing net income (loss), after
deducting current period dividends on the Company's preferred
stock, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. The weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was 5,317,758. 

Diluted
per share amounts are computed by dividing net income (loss)
attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, after adjusting for the estimated
effect of the assumed conversion of all cumulative convertible
preferred stock and outstanding convertible debentures, if
dilutive, into shares of common stock. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible
preferred stock and collateralized convertible debentures would
have been anti-dilutive. 

The
following is a summary of the calculations used in computing basic
and diluted income (loss) per share for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

(3) Statement
of Cash Flows 

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic No. 230,  Statement of Cash Flows ,
requires a statement of cash flows as part of a full set of
financial statements. For quarterly reporting purposes, the Company
has elected to condense the reporting of its net cash flows.
Related party interest paid during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $5,925,000. There were no payments of interest during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.

Cash 

Restricted cash of

The
proceeds from the sale of the Property of $9 million were received
on June 23, 2016 and payment of the primary debt obligation,
including all accrued interest totaling $970,000, was made to PGIP,
the holder of the first mortgage note and an affiliate of the
Company. In addition, on June 23, 2016, the remaining principal of
the convertible debentures payable to related parties totaling
$1,500,000 was paid and a portion of the related accrued interest
was paid totaling $5,455,000 to the current holders of such
debentures. LIC, an affiliate of L-PGI, the Company s primary
preferred stock shareholder and Love-1989, also an affiliate of
L-PGI, held the collateralized convertible debentures. 

The
Trustee of the 6.5% unsecured subordinated convertible debentures,
which matured in June, 1991, with an original face amount of
$1,034,000, provided notice of final distribution to holders of
such debentures on September 2, 2014. In connection with such final
distributions, the Trustee has maintained a debenture reserve fund
with a balance of $41,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, available for final distribution to holders of such
debentures who surrender their respective debenture
certificates.

(continued) 

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there were no
unsecured subordinated convertible debentures that were surrendered
by their respective debenture holders and no funds were utilized
from the debenture reserve account. During the year ended December
31, 2015, such unsecured subordinated convertible debentures with
face amounts of $80,000 were surrendered by their respective
debenture holders. Funds utilized from the debenture reserve
account were $7,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 in
payment of a final distribution to such debenture holders.
Accordingly, the Company recognized $73,000 in forgiveness of debt
during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, accrued
interest in the amount of $136,000 on such debentures that have
been surrendered was recorded as forgiveness of interest expense
during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the outstanding principal
balance on such 6.5% unsecured subordinated convertible debentures
that were not surrendered by the respective holders equals $447,000
plus accrued and unpaid interest of $809,000 and $788,000,
respectively. If and when such remaining debentures are surrendered
to the Trustee, the applicable portion of such principal and
accrued interest will similarly be recorded as debt and accrued
interest forgiveness. As the Company has consistently stated in
prior filings, the Company believes that any potential claims by
the respective debenture holders on such 6.5% unsecured
subordinated convertible debentures would be barred under the
applicable statutes of limitations.

At
December 31, 2015, the Company had an operating loss carryforward

income. These operating losses expire at various dates through
2035. 

The

September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 at the statutory

(12) Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial instruments, other
than debt, approximates fair value at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 because of the short maturity of those
instruments. It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of
the Company s notes payable and its convertible debentures
because these debts are in default causing no basis for estimating
value by reference to quoted market prices or current rates offered
to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturities.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations 

Preliminary Note 

The
Company s remaining land inventory consists of 6 single
family lots, an approximate 7 acre parcel and some other minor
parcels of real estate consisting of easements in Citrus County
Florida, which are owned through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Sugarmill Woods, Inc. ( Sugarmill Woods ). In addition,
Punta Gorda Isles Sales, Inc. ( PGIS ), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, owns 12 parcels of real estate in
Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximates 60 acres, but
these parcels have limited value because of associated
developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other
obstacles to development and sale. 

On June
17, 2016 two contracts were executed for the sale of two
undeveloped parcels of real property consisting of 369 acres
located in Hernando County, Florida (the  Property )
between Sugarmill Woods and the State of Florida Department of
Transportation (the  Florida DOT ). The Property was
encumbered by secured creditor claims, and the sale of the Property
closed on June 21, 2016 for $9,000,000. The Florida DOT desired to
acquire the Property in connection with the northward extension of
the Suncoast Parkway as part of the Suncoast Parkway, Project
2. 

The
proceeds from the sale of the Property were received on June 23,
2016 and payment of the primary lender debt totaling $500,000 and
all accrued interest totaling $470,000, was made to PGIP LLC
( PGIP ), the holder of the first mortgage note and an
affiliate of the Company. In addition, on June 23, 2016, the
remaining principal of the collateralized convertible debentures
totaling $1,500,000 and a portion of the accrued interest related
to such debentures totaling $5,455,000 was paid to the current
holders of such debentures. Love Investment Company
( LIC ), an affiliate of Love-PGI Partners, L.P.
( L-PGI ), the Company s primary preferred stock
shareholder, and Love-1989 Florida Partners, LP
( Love-1989 ), also an affiliate of L-PGI, held the
collateralized convertible debentures.      

The
Trustee of the 6.5% subordinated debentures, which matured in June,
1991, with an original face amount of $1,034,000, provided notice
of final distribution to holders of such debentures on September 2,
2014. In connection with such final distribution, the Trustee
maintained a debenture reserve fund with a balance of $41,000 as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which is
available for final distribution to holders of such debentures who
surrender their respective debenture certificates.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued) 

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 there were no 6.5%
subordinated convertible debentures that were surrendered by their
respective debenture holders and no funds were utilized from the
debenture reserve account. During the year ended December 31, 2015
such subordinated convertible debentures with a face amount of
$80,000 were surrendered by their respective debenture
holders. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the remaining outstanding
principal balance on such 6.5% subordinated convertible debentures
that were not surrendered by the respective holders equals $447,000
plus accrued and unpaid interest of $809,000 and $788,000,
respectively. If and when such remaining debentures are surrendered
to the Trustee, the applicable portion of such principal and
accrued interest will similarly be recorded as debt and interest
forgiveness. As the Company has consistently stated in prior
filings, the Company believes that any potential claims by the
respective debenture holders on such 6.5% subordinated convertible
debentures would be barred under the applicable statutes of
limitations. 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company remained in default under its
subordinated convertible debentures and notes payable, as well as
the accrued interest with respect to its collateralized convertible
debentures. 

Results of Operations 

Revenues for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1,000 to $1,000
from $2,000 for the comparable 2015 period as a result of decreased
interest income. Interest income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 represents interest earned on the
Company s money market account. Interest income for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 represents related party interest
on the short-term note receivable with LIC, an affiliate of L-PGI,
the Company s primary preferred stock shareholder. The
Company received payment of the note receivable balance from LIC on
June 23, 2016. 

Expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1,832,000 when
compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of a
decrease in interest expense during the three months ended
September 30, 2016. Interest expense for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1,834,000 compared to the
same period in 2015, primarily due to the repayment of the
outstanding principal of the Company s collateralized debt
with a portion of the proceeds from the Property sale received on
June 23, 2016, including the primary lender debt of $500,000 with
PGIP, and the collateralized convertible debenture principal in the
amount of $1,500,000 paid to LIC and Love-1989. As a result there
was no interest expense during the three months ended September 30,
2016 with respect to such collateralized debt. 

Taxes
and assessments expense decreased by $1,000 during the three month
period ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in
2015 as a result of lower real estate tax expense due to the sale
of Property sold to the Florida DOT on June 21, 2016. Consulting
and accounting expenses increased by $1,000 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.
A quarterly consulting fee is paid to Love Real Estate Company
( LREC ), an affiliate of L-PGI, of one-tenth of one
percent of the carrying value of the Company s assets which
increased effective June 21, 2016 with the sale of Property to the
Florida DOT.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued) 

Legal
and professional expenses during the three months ended September
30, 2016 increased by approximately $2,000 when compared to the
same period in 2015, primarily as a result of additional legal
expenses incurred in connection with the filing of the
Company s periodic reports during the three month period
ended September 30, 2016. As a result, a net loss of $364,000 was
incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
a net loss of $2,195,000 for the comparable period in 2015. After
deducting preferred dividends, totaling $160,000 for each of the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 , with respect to
the Class A Preferred Stock, a net loss per share of $(.10) and
$(.44) was incurred for the three month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. The total cumulative preferred dividends in arrears
with respect to the Class A Preferred Stock through September 30,
2016 is $13,715,000. 

Revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $8,996,000 to
$9,003,000 from $7,000 for the comparable 2015 period primarily as
a result of the sale by Sugarmill Woods of the Property to the
Florida DOT on June 21, 2016 for $9,000,000. Interest income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $1,000
represents interest earned on the Company s money market
account. Interest income from related party decreased by $5,000 in
the first nine months of 2016 to $2,000 from $7,000 for the
comparable period in 2015 due to receipt of the repayment of the
short term note receivable balance from LIC, an affiliate of L-PGI,
the Company s primary preferred stock shareholder, on June
23, 2016 . Net income of $3,330,000 was realized for the first nine
months of 2016, which includes a gain of $8,255,000 from the
Property sale to the Florida DOT. This compared to a net loss of
$6,195,000 for the first nine months of 2015. After deducting
preferred dividends, totaling $480,000 for each of the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net income (loss) per share of
$.54 and $(1.26), respectively, were reported for the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The
proceeds from the sale of the Property were received from the
Florida DOT on June 23, 2016 and payment of the first mortgage
obligation was made to PGIP, an affiliate of the Company. In
addition, on June 23, 2016, the collateralized convertible
debentures principal was paid and a portion of the accrued interest
was paid to the current holders of such debentures. LIC, an
affiliate of L-PGI, the Company s primary preferred stock
shareholder, and Love-1989, also an affiliate of L-PGI, held the
collateralized convertible debentures.

The
June 23, 2016 payments of principal and interest were as
follows: 

Real
estate sales and cost of real estate sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were as
follows: 

Real
estate sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
by $9,000,000 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015
solely due to the sale of the Property by Sugarmill Woods to the
Florida DOT on June 21, 2016. There were no sales of real estate
for the comparable period in 2015.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued) 

Expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $529,000 when
compared to the same period in 2015 as follows: 

Cost of
real estate sales and expenses of sale for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016 increased by $745,000 compared to the nine
month period ended September 30, 2015 solely as a result of the
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Property sale.
There was no such expense for the comparable period in
2015. 

Interest expense
for the first nine months of 2016 decreased by $1,487,000 compared
to the same period in 2015. Interest expense relating to the
Company s current outstanding debt held by non-related
parties increased by $23,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result
of interest accruing on past due balances which increased at
various intervals throughout the nine month period for accrued but
unpaid interest. Interest expense-related party decreased by
$1,510,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the repayment of the
outstanding principal of the Company s collateralized debt
with a portion of the proceeds from the Property sale received on
June 23, 2016, including the primary lender debt of $500,000 with
PGIP and the collateralized convertible debenture principal in the
amount of $1,500,000 paid to LIC and Love-1989.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued) 

There
was no forgiveness of debt and interest in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to $209,000 for the same period in
2015. The forgiveness of debt and interest for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 is attributed to the 6.5% subordinated
convertible debentures which matured in June, 1991, in the face
amount of $80,000 that were surrendered in exchange for a final
distribution of $92 per $1,000 in face value of such debentures.
Accrued interest in the amount of $136,000 on such surrendered
debentures was recorded as forgiveness of interest expense during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and the remaining
principal amount of such surrendered debentures in the amount of
$73,000 was recorded as forgiveness of debt during such
period. 

Legal
and professional expenses increased by $7,000 in the first nine
months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of
legal expenses incurred in connection with the filing of the
Company s periodic reports pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the first nine months of
2016. 

Cash Flow Analysis 

Cash
provided by operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $2,846,000, primarily reflecting the net
effect of the $9,000,000 received in the sale of the Property to
the Florida DOT and $5,925,000 of accrued interest paid on
collateralized debt. This compared to cash used in operating
activities of $130,000 for the comparable 2015 period. In addition,
during the first nine months of 2016, the Company received $178,000
in payment of the note receivable principal from LIC, an affiliate
of the Company and the restricted cash of $5,000 from PGIP, the
first mortgage lender, which was released upon the sale of the
Property and satisfaction of the primary lender debt obligation
owed to PGIP. Net cash used in financing activities was for the
principal repayment of $2,000,000 of primary lender debt to PGIP
and collateralized convertible debentures to LIC and
Love-1989. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Total
assets increased by $220,000 at September 30, 2016 compared to
total assets at December 31, 2015, reflecting the following
changes: 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash increased by
$1,029,000 compared to December 31, 2015, which is primarily
attributed to the remaining proceeds of the Property sale to the
Florida DOT in the second quarter of 2016. The Company anticipates
that the cash will be utilized by the Company to fund its future
operating activities.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued) 

Restricted cash
decreased by $5,000 during the first nine months of 2016 with the
release of restricted funds upon the sale of the Property and
satisfaction of the primary lender debt obligation owed to
PGIP. 

Receivables-related
party decreased by $178,000 during the first nine months of 2016 as
the Company received payment of the outstanding note receivable
balance from LIC, an affiliate of the Company. 

Land
and improvement inventories decreased by $625,000 during the first
nine months of 2016 as a result of the sale of the Property, with
the cost of the Property sold reflected in the cost of real estate
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Liabilities were
approximately $89,343,000 at September 30, 2016 compared to
approximately $92,453,000 at December 31, 2015, reflecting the
following changes: 

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the amount of
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $3,000 primarily
as a result of timing differences. Accrued real estate taxes
decreased by $4,000 during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 due to the payment of previously accrued taxes. There was
a net decrease of accrued interest in the amount of $1,103,000
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 with the
aggregate payment of $5,925,000 in accrued interest to PGIP, as the
holder of the Company s first mortgage note, and the holders
of the collateralized convertible debentures being offset by an
increase of accrued interest in the amount of $4,822,000 of
interest expense for such period. During the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016, the entire outstanding principal of the
primary lender debt in the amount of $500,000 was repaid to PGIP,
and the entire outstanding principal of the convertible debentures
in the aggregate amount of $1,500,000 was repaid to LIC and
Love-1989.

Results of Operations (continued) 

The
Company remains in default on the entire principal amount plus
interest (including certain sinking fund and interest payments with
respect to the subordinated convertible debentures) of its
subordinated convertible debentures and notes payable as well as
the remaining accrued interest owed with respect to the
collateralized convertible debentures. 

The
principal and accrued interest amounts due as of September 30, 2016
are as indicated in the following table: 

The
Company does not have sufficient funds available (after payment of,
or the reserving for the payment of, anticipated future operating
expenses) to satisfy the principal or interest obligations on the
above debentures and notes payable or any arrearage in preferred
dividends. 

The
Company remains totally dependent upon the sale of parcels of its
various remaining properties with respect to its ability to make
any future debt service payments.

Forward Looking Statements 

The
discussion set forth in this Item 2, as well as other portions of
this Form 10-Q, may contain forward-looking statements. Such
statements are based upon the information currently available to
management of the Company and management s perception thereof
as of the date of the Form 10-Q. When used in this Form 10-Q, words
such as  anticipates,   estimates, 
 believes,   expects,  and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual
results of the Company s operations could materially differ
from those forward-looking statements. The differences could be

and the counties in which the Company owns any property;
institution of legal action by the bondholders for collection of
any amounts due under the subordinated convertible debentures
(notwithstanding the Company s belief that at least a portion
of such actions might be barred under applicable statute of
limitations); changes in management strategy; and other factors set
forth in reports and other documents filed by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.
