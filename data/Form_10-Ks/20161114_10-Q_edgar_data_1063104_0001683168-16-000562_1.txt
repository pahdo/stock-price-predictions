1.   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the accompanying interim condensed
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, have been prepared by management pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
for interim financial reporting. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in the opinion of
management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments and accruals) necessary to present fairly
the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Proteo, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary (hereinafter collectively
referred to as the  Company ) as of and for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Operating results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or
for any other interim period during such year. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, although the Company
believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. 

NATURE OF BUSINESS 

The Company is a clinical stage drug development
company focusing on the development of anti-inflammatory treatments for rare diseases with significant unmet needs. The Company's
management deems its lead drug candidate Tiprelestat (also known as Elafin) for intravenous use to be one of the most prospective
treatments of acute postoperative inflammatory complications, in particular after esophageal cancer surgery. Elafin appears to
be also a promising compound for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The clinical development is currently focused
in Europe with the intention to receive the primary approval in Europe. 

The products that the Company is developing,
to the extent they are considered drugs or biologics, are governed by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (in the United States)
and the regulations of State and various foreign government agencies. The Company's proposed pharmaceutical products to be used
by humans are subject to certain clearance procedures administered by the above regulatory agencies. 

Since its inception, the Company has primarily
been engaged in the research and development of its proprietary product Elafin. The Company intends to seek the various governmental
regulatory approvals for the marketing of Elafin. Management believes that none of its planned products will produce sufficient
revenues in the near future. As a result, the Company intends to generate revenue by out-licensing and marketing activities. There
are no assurances, however, that the Company will be able to develop such products, or if produced, that they will be accepted
in the marketplace. 

From time to time, the Company enters
into collaborative arrangements for the research and development (R D), manufacture and/or commercialization of products
and product candidates. These collaborations may provide for non-refundable, upfront license fees, R D and commercial
performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The Company's collaboration agreements
with third parties are generally performed on a  best efforts  basis with no guarantee of either technological or
commercial success. 

Proteo, Inc.'s common stock is currently quoted
on the OTC QB under the symbol  PTEO . 

CONCENTRATIONS 

The Company maintains substantially all of
its cash in bank accounts at a German private commercial bank. The Company's bank accounts at this financial institution are presently
protected by the voluntary  Deposit Protection Fund of The German Private Commercial Banks . The Company has not experienced
any losses in these accounts. 

The Company's operations, including research
and development activities and most of its assets, are located in Germany. The Company's operations are subject to various political,
economic, and other risks and uncertainties inherent in Germany and the European Union. 

PROTEO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY  

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)  

OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 

The Company will require substantial additional
funding for continuing research and development, obtaining regulatory approval, and for the commercialization of its products.
Management plans to generate revenues from product sales, but there are no purchase commitments for any of the proposed products.
Additionally, the Company may generate revenues from out-licensing activities. There can be no assurance that further out-licensing
may be achieved or whether such will generate significant profit. In the absence of significant sales and profits, the Company
may seek to raise additional funds to meet its working capital requirements through the additional placement of debt and/or equity
securities. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed, or that such
funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. 

The Company's line of future pharmaceutical
products being developed by its German subsidiary, to the extent they may be considered drugs or biologics, are governed by the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (in the United States) and by the regulations of State agencies and various foreign government
agencies. There can be no assurances that the Company will obtain the regulatory approvals required to market its products. The
pharmaceutical products under development will be subject to more stringent regulatory requirements because they are recombinant
products for humans. The Company has no experience in obtaining regulatory clearance on these types of products. Therefore, the
Company will be subject to the risks of delays in obtaining or failing to obtain regulatory clearance and other uncertainties,
including financial, operational, technological, regulatory and other risks associated with an emerging business, including the
potential risk of business failure. 

The Company is exposed to risks related to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Management does not utilize derivative instruments to hedge against such exposure. 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

The condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of Proteo, Inc. and Proteo Biotech AG ( PBAG ),
its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES 

The Company capitalizes the cost of supplies
used in its research and development activities if such supplies are deemed to have alternative future uses, usually in other research
and development projects. Such costs are expensed as used to research and development expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statements of operations. 

Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or
services that have the characteristics that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred
and capitalized as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are expensed to research and development as the related goods and services are
received. 

The costs of materials that are acquired for
a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses (in other research and development projects
or otherwise) and therefore no separate economic values are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are
incurred. 

The Company may receive grants from the German
government which are used to fund research and development activities (see Note 7). Grant funds to be received for the reimbursement
of qualified research and development expenses are offset against such expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive income (loss) when the related expenses are incurred.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Topic of the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC 
or  Codification ) requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments when it is practicable
to estimate that value. Management believes that the carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, consisting primarily
of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair value at September 30, 2016 due to their short-term nature.
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and, during the three-month
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, did not have any assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value
on a non-recurring basis. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

It is the Company's intent to recognize revenues
from future product sales at the time of product delivery. 

As more fully described in Note 5, amounts
received under the Development Agreement are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the projected performance period
under the Development Agreement in relation to development expenses incurred. 

SIGNIFICANT RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In the opinion of management, neither the FASB,
its Emerging Issues Task Force, the AICPA, nor the SEC have issued any additional accounting pronouncements since the Company filed
its December 31, 2015 Form 10-K that are expected to have material impact on the Company's future consolidated financial statements. 

2.   INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE  

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed
based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted average shares outstanding assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. There were
no dilutive potential common shares outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015. As such, basic and diluted income (loss) per common
share equals net loss, as reported, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the respective periods. 

3.   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  

Assets and liabilities of the Company's German
operations are translated from Euros (the functional currency) into U.S. dollars (the reporting currency) at period-end exchange
rates; equity transactions are translated at historical rates; and income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange
rates for the period. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from such translations are excluded from the results
of operations but are included in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Accumulated other comprehensive income approximated $20,000 and $1,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)  

4.   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS  

The Company records payables related to a certain
licensing agreement (Note 6) in accordance with the Foreign Currency Matters Topic of the Codification. Quarterly commitments under
such agreement are denominated in Euros. For each reporting period, the Company translates the quarterly amount to U.S. dollars
at the exchange rate effective on that date. If the exchange rate changes between when the liability is incurred and the time payment
is made, a foreign exchange gain or loss results. 

Additionally, the Company computes a foreign
exchange gain or loss at each balance sheet date on all recorded transactions denominated in foreign currencies that have not been
settled. The difference between the exchange rate that could have been used to settle the transaction on the date it occurred and
the exchange rate at the balance sheet date is the gain or loss that is currently recognized. The Company recorded foreign currency
transaction gains (losses) of approximately ($35,000) and $91,000 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, which are included in interest and other income (expense), net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss. 

5.  DEFERRED REVENUES  

On May 16, 2014, the Company entered into a
funding and revenue sharing agreement (the  Development Agreement ) with an unrelated third party (disclosed in the
Company s 8-K filing to the SEC as of May 22, 2014). The third party will fund operational expenses of the Company as well
as the development costs related to the clinical development program aimed at receiving regulatory approval for the use of Elafin
for the intravenous treatment of patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery in the European Union. Total payments by the third
party to the Company shall not exceed 3.5 million Euros. Through September 30, 2016, the Company received approximately 1.5 million
Euros of the 3.5 million Euro maximum. Revenue participation right payments will be made to the party when and if Elafin is commercialized
within the European Union for the intravenous treatment of patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery. 

The Development Agreement will terminate after
the earlier of 15 years or 10 complete and consecutive years after the first regulatory approval of Elafin for this indication.
Under no circumstances are the payments refundable, even if the drug is never commercialized. As no revenue sharing payments will
be made unless Elafin is commercialized, the payments received are being accounted for as payments for the Company to use reasonable
efforts to complete development, obtain regulatory approvals, and to commercialize Elafin (i.e. the performance period). Therefore,
amounts received from the party will be deferred and recognized as revenue over the projected performance period under the Development
Agreement in relation to expenses incurred. 

From inception of the Development Agreement through September 30, 2015, management
estimated total Elafin related development expenses at 3.5 million Euro. As revenues to be received also totaled 3.5 million Euros,
revenue was recognized at 100% of the related expenses incurred. Beginning October 1, 2015, management increased their estimate
of remaining development expenses by 3.5 million Euro and began recognizing revenues at 43% of related expenses. The increase
in estimated total development expenses was due to additional clinical indicators that will be explored by the Company. 

For the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized approximately $191,000 and $466,000, respectively, of development income under the Development
Agreement, which is included in revenues in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, development income approximated $191,000 and $466,000, respectively. For the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, development income approximated $111,000 and $159,000, respectively. Deferred revenues
approximated $167,000 and $212,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

6.   LONG-TERM LIABILITIES  

ACCRUED LICENSING FEES 

On December 30, 2000, the Company entered into
a thirty-year license agreement, beginning January 1, 2001 (the  License Agreement ), with Dr. Oliver Wiedow, MD, the
owner and inventor of several patents, patent rights and technologies related to Elafin. Pursuant to the License Agreement, the
Company agreed to pay Dr. Wiedow an annual license fee of 110,000 Euros for a period of six years. The License Agreement was amended
in December 2008 to waive non-payment defaults and to defer the due dates of each payment. In July 2011, in February 2012, February
2013, and again in June 2014, Dr. Wiedow agreed in writing to waive the non-payment defaults and agreed to defer the due dates
of the payments for the outstanding balance of 570,000 Euro. As a result, the outstanding balance of 570,000 Euros is due on April
30, 2018. While the total amount owed does not currently bear interest, the Amendment provides that any late payment shall be subject
to interest at an annual rate equal to the German Base Interest Rate plus six percent. In the event that the Company's financial
condition improves, the parties can agree to increase and/or accelerate the payments. Dr. Wiedow, who is a director of the Company,
beneficially owned approximately 27% of the Company's outstanding common stock as of September 30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued
approximately $639,000 of licensing fees payable to Dr. Wiedow, which are included in long-term liabilities. This is an increase
over the respective accrual of approximately $622,000 at December 31, 2015, which was solely due to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. 

OTHER LIABILITIES 

Other liabilities at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 consist of employee compensation that was incurred in 2015 and 2016, but for which payment was agreed to be deferred
until 2018. 

7.   GRANTS  

In June 2016, the German State of Schleswig-Holstein
granted PBAG approximately 874,000 Euros (the  Grant ) for further research and development of the Company's pharmaceutical
product Elafin. The Grant covers 50% of eligible research and development costs incurred from December 1, 2015 through November
30, 2018. Grant funds approximating 82,000 Euros ($91,000) were received during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.
An additional 81,000 Euros ($90,000) of eligible expense was submitted for reimbursement, but payment was not received at September
30, 2016. As such, research and development expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 have been reduced by approximately
$182,000, and a grant funds receivable of $90,000 is included on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September
30, 2016. 

8.   INCOME TAXES  

The Company accounts for income taxes under
the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management evaluates the need to establish a valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences, the period in which they are expected
to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when
it is  more likely than not  that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management has determined
that a full valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets is appropriate. 

PROTEO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY  

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)  

There is no material income tax expense recorded
for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, due to the Company's net losses and related changes to the full valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets. 

Based on management s evaluation of uncertainty
in income taxes, the Company concluded that there were no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its financial
statements or related disclosures. Accordingly, no adjustments to recorded tax liabilities or accumulated deficit were required.  As
of September 30, 2016, there were no increases or decreases to liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions. 

9.  STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS RECEIVABLE AND OTHER CAPITAL EQUITY TRANSACTIONS  

On September 7, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate
of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to designate 1,000,000 shares of its authorized preferred stock
as Series B-1 Preferred Stock ( Series B-1 Stock ). On September 9, 2016, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with CFI Innovation GmbH Berlin Unternehmensberatung und Beteiligungen ( Investor ),
a German corporation. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investor 1,000,000 shares of the Company s
Series B-1 Preferred Stock (the  Purchase Shares ) at the price of EUR 1.00 per share (the  Purchase Price ),
for an aggregate purchase price of EUR 1,000,000. An initial closing of 100,000 of the Purchase Shares was to occur on October
31, 2016 or on such earlier date as the Investor and the Company may agree (the  Initial Closing Date ).The Investor
agreed to deliver EUR 100,000, which is the Purchase Price with respect to such Purchase Shares, on or before the Initial Closing
Date. However, as of the Initial Closing Date. the Company only received 10,000 EUR ($12,000) from the Investor and the Initial
Closing Date has been delayed until the Investor provides the remaining amount due for the purchase of the 100,000 Purchase Shares
to be purchased at the Initial Closing Date. After the Initial Closing Date, subsequent closings of the remaining Purchase Shares
will occur on the fifth (5th) business day after such date or dates that Investor delivers all or a portion of the Purchase Price
with respect to such Purchase Shares; provided, however, that Investor shall deliver the Purchase Price for all remaining Purchase
Shares on or before March 31, 2017. In partial consideration for the Investor agreeing to purchase the Purchase Shares from the
Company, the Company agreed to rebate four percent (4%) of the Purchase price paid to the Company prior to March 31, 2017 on each
of June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018, and June 30 2019 (the  Rebate Dates ). 

The rights, preferences, and privileges of
the Series B-1 Preferred Stock are as follows: 

Holders of shares of Series B-1 Preferred
Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors preferential dividends at the per share rate
of 1.5 times the per share amount of each and any cash and non-cash dividend distributed to the holders of the Registrants common
stock.    

Except as otherwise required by law, the
Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights and not be entitled to vote as a separate class on an matter to be voted
on by stockholders of the Company.    

Upon any liquidation, voluntary or otherwise,
dissolution or winding up of the Registrant, holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive per share distributions
equal to 1.5 times the rate of per share distributions to be made to the holders of the Registrant s common stock.    

In the event the Registrant enters into
any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of common stock of the Registrant are exchanged
into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock
shall automatically be simultaneously exchanged for or converted into the same stock or securities, cash and/or other property
at a rate per share equal to 1.5 times the rate per share that the common stock is being exchanged or converted.    

Further details are described in the Company's
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 13, 2016. 

In September 2016, the Company received 5,000
Euros ($6,000) from the Investor, as a refundable deposit for the Initial Closing Date. Such amount is included in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. 

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject
to the safe harbors created by such statutes. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations
that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, to the extent that this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking
statements regarding the financial condition, operating results, business prospects or any other aspect of the Company, please
be advised that the Company's actual financial condition, operating results and business performance may differ materially from
that projected or estimated by management in forward-looking statements. 

Such differences may be caused by a variety
of factors, including but not limited to adverse economic conditions, intense competition, including intensification of price competition
and entry of new competitors and products, adverse federal, state and local government regulation, inadequate capital, unexpected
costs and operating deficits, increases in general and administrative costs and other specific risks that may be alluded to in
this Quarterly Report or in other reports issued by the Company. In addition, the business and operations of the Company are subject
to substantial risks that increase the uncertainty inherent in the forward-looking statements. The inclusion of forward looking
statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by management or any other person that the objectives
or plans of the Company will be achieved. 

The Company currently generates revenue under
a development agreement. Additionally, after the launch of the Company's products, there can be no assurance that the Company will
generate positive cash flow and there can be no assurances as to the level of revenues, if any, the Company may actually achieve
from its planned principal operations. 

OVERVIEW 

Proteo is a clinical stage drug development
company focusing on the development of anti-inflammatory treatments for rare diseases with significant unmet needs. The Company's
management deems its lead drug candidate Elafin for intravenous use to be one of the most prospective treatments of acute postoperative
inflammatory complications, in particular after esophageal cancer surgery. Elafin also appears to be a promising compound for the
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and for preventing complications of organ transplantation. 

The Company's success will depend on its ability
to prove that Elafin is well tolerated by humans and its efficacy in the indicated diseases in order to demonstrate a favorable
benefit/risk balance. There can be no assurance that the Company will receive government approval for the use of Elafin in further
clinical trials or its use as a drug in any of the intended applications. 

Proteo has obtained Orphan drug designations
within the European Union for the use of Elafin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic
pulmonary hypertension as well as for the treatment of esophageal cancer. The latter indication, especially the postoperative inflammation,
the main reason for postoperative morbidity, will be targeted by Elafin treatment. Within the United States, Proteo has obtained
Orphan drug designations for the use of Elafin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as for the prevention
of inflammatory complications of transthoracic esophagectomy. 

For the development of its lead product Elafin,
Proteo has established a network of globally renowned research institutes, physicians and hospitals in Europe and the US. The development
of Elafin has been widely supported by public grants. Worldwide leading funding bodies, such as the American NIH and the British
MRC, supported preclinical and clinical studies on Elafin with high volume grants. 

Proteo currently focuses on the clinical development
of Elafin for prophylactic treatment of acute postoperative inflammatory complications in the surgical therapy of esophageal cancer.
Clinical development for further indications and preclinical research into new fields of application are conducted in cooperation
with third parties. 

The tolerability of Elafin in healthy male
subjects was demonstrated in a Phase I clinical single dose escalating study. A placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial on
the effect of Elafin on the postoperative inflammatory reactions and postoperative clinical course was conducted in patients undergoing
transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. A further Phase II study, EMPIRE (Elafin Myocardial Protection from Ischemia
Reperfusion Injury), an investigator initiated trial at Edinburgh University, was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy
of Elafin in coronary bypass surgery. The result from the EMPIRE trial which indicates that Elafin has cardioprotective properties
by reducing the cardiac troponin I release has been published in 2015 (Alam et al., Heart 2015). Further details are described
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. 

In January 2015, our subsidiary signed a contract
with a contract research organization ( CRO ) for conducting a pivotal clinical trial with Elafin for the prophylactic
treatment of acute postoperative complications after resection of esophageal cancer ( POSTCOM TRIAL ). In addition,
our subsidiary commissioned the GMP manufacturing of the study drug. In December 2015, the EMA pediatric committee ( PDCO )
agreed that no investigations in pediatric populations will be performed, as children are almost not affected by this kind of cancer.
We plan to conduct the POSTCOM TRIAL at up to 10 sites in the European Union and it is expected to enroll 80 patients. 

In September 2015, we received a Pre-Investigational
New Drug Application ( PIND ) Meeting Request Granted Letter from the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )
for discussing the development strategies for Elafin to be used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH )
within the framework of our collaboration with Dr. Rabinovitch at Stanford University. A face-to-face meeting occurred in November
2015. 

In February 2016, the results of a biodistribution
study with radiolabeled Elafin were published (Kaschwich et al., Drug Metab Pharmacokinet 2016). The researchers found high accumulation
in the kidney and concluded that this could be of great importance in the future as within the treatment of reperfusion injury
of the kidney. 

In June 2016, we announced that our subsidiary
has been awarded a BFEI grant (the  Grant ) from the German State of Schleswig-Holstein. The Grant has a volume of
up to EUR 874,000 (approx. US$ 1 million) and will be used for the R D program to develop a new formulation of Proteo's lead
compound Elafin. A new Elafin formulation will allow Proteo to extend the development pipeline to treat chronic diseases, such
as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 

On September 9, 2016, we entered into a Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with a third-party ( Investor ). Pursuant to the Agreement,
the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investor 1,000,000 shares of the Company s Series B-1 Preferred Stock at the
price of EUR 1.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of EUR 1,000,000 and the Investor agreed to purchase such shares no
later than March 31, 2017. See Note 9 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

In September 2016 we signed an agreement with
a third party within the framework of our collaboration with Marlene Rabinovitch for an animal toxicity program for the use of
Elafin in the treatment of a PAH. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

REVENUES 

Revenue reported represent income
recognized under the Development Agreement, as described above and in Note 5 to the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements. Approximately $191,000 and $466,000 was recognized as development income during the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $111,000 and $159,000 was recognized as development income during the
three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in
research activities in 2016,  and the related decrease in revenue recognition under the Development Agreement. From inception
of the Development Agreement through September 30, 2015, management estimated total Elafin related development expenses at
3.5 million Euro. As revenues to be received also totaled 3.5 million Euros, revenue was recognized at 100% of the related
expenses incurred. Beginning October 1, 2015, management increased their estimate of remaining development expenses by 3.5
million Euro and began recognizing revenues at 43% of related expenses. The increase in expenses was due to additional
clinical indicators that will be explored by the Company. Revenues continued to be recognized at 43% of related expenses for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

OPERATING EXPENSES 

The Company's operating expenses for the three-month
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 approximated $156,000 and $259,000, respectively, a decrease of approximately $2,000
and $209,000 over the respective periods of the prior year. General and administrative expenses (mostly professional and legal
fees) for the three-month and nine-month periods increased (decreased) $1,000 and ($5,000) respectively. Research and development
expenses decreased $4,000 and $204,000 over the same periods. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due
to $181,000 of Grant funds recorded in 2016, which were netted against research and development expenses, as well as decreases
to research related salaries and expenditures in preparation for the POSTCOM TRIAL in 2016. 

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) 

Interest and other income (expense), net
for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 approximated ($9,000) and ($22,000), respectively,
compared to ($11,000) and $107,000 for the respective periods in 2015, a net increase (decrease) of approximately $2,000 and
($129,000), respectively. The changes are driven primarily by fluctuating foreign currency transaction gains and losses due to
a fluctuations of the Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses were primarily driven
by unrealized gains and losses on accrued licensing fees related to the Licensing Agreement, which is denominated in
Euros. 

INCOME TAXES 

There is no material income tax expense recorded
for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, due to the Company's net losses. The Company has a deferred tax asset of $2,314,000
at September 30, 2016 relating primarily to tax net operating loss carryforwards, as discussed below, and temporary differences
related to the recognition of accrued licensing fees. Full valuation allowances have been established against these
deferred tax assets as it is likely that the Company will not be able to utilize them. 

The Federal NOL expires in varying years through
2025. The foreign net operating loss relates to Germany and does not have an expiration date. In the event the Company were to
experience a greater than 50% change in ownership, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the utilization of the
Company's Federal NOLs could be restricted. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS 

The Company experienced other comprehensive
gains (losses) of approximately $18,000 and ($80,000) related to foreign currency translation adjustments during the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $7,000 and $14,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. The changes are primarily due to a fluctuating U.S. Dollar (our reporting currency) compared to the Euro (our functional
currency) during the periods. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Proteo is a holding company that owns 100%
of Proteo Biotech AG, its operating subsidiary in Germany (the  Subsidiary ). There were no undistributed earnings
of the Subsidiary to repatriate to the U.S. parent (i.e. the Company). 

The Company received approximately 190,000
Euros and 320,000 Euros under the Development Agreement during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company expects to receive approximately 2.0 million Euros in future periods under this agreement. 

In June 2016, the German State of Schleswig-Holstein
granted PBAG approximately 874,000 Euros (the  Grant ) for further research and development of the Company's pharmaceutical
product Elafin. The Grant covers 50% of eligible research and development costs incurred from December 1, 2015 through November
30, 2018. Grant funds approximating 82,000 Euros ($91,000) were received during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.
PBAG submitted for the reimbursement of additional eligible expenses approximating 81,000 Euros. As such approximately $90,000
was accrued as a grant funds receivable on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

In September 2016, we entered into a Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with a third-party ( Investor ). Pursuant to the Agreement,
the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investor 1,000,000 shares of the Company s Series B-1 Preferred Stock at the
price of EUR 1.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of EUR 1,000,000 and the Investor agreed to purchase such shares no
later than March 31, 2017. See Note 9 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

In June 2014, Dr. Wiedow agreed in writing
to waive any non-payment defaults under the License Agreement and to defer all current payments to April 2018. See Note 6 to the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the payment terms under the License Agreement. 

The Company has cash approximating $148,000
as of September 30, 2016 to support current and future operations. This is a decrease of $89,000 over the December 31, 2015 cash
balance of approximately $237,000. Such cash is held by the Subsidiary in Germany in Euros. The Company does not intend to repatriate
any amount of this cash to the United States as it will be used to fund the Subsidiary s continued operations. Management
believes that the Company will generate sufficient revenues under the Development Agreement to fund its development activities
over the next few years. Given the Company's current cash on hand, anticipated collections under the Development Agreement, the
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, and collections under the grant of the German State of Schleswig-Holstein management believes
the Company has sufficient cash on hand to cover its operations for the next 2 to 3 years. As for periods beyond the next 3 years,
the Company expects to continue to direct the majority of research and development expenses towards the development of Elafin,
although it is extremely difficult to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with Elafin due
to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with preclinical and clinical trial development. 

These unknown variables and uncertainties include, but are not limited
to: 

the uncertainty of future clinical trial results;   

the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical trial;   

the uncertainty of the applicable regulatory bodies allowing our studies to move forward;   

the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study. Any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates;   

the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements;   

the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies, which may increase or decrease our future costs,   

the uncertainty of our ability to raise additional capital to support our future research and development efforts; and the uncertainty of our ability to collect the remaining payments owed under the Development Agreement.   

As a result of the foregoing, the Company's
success will largely depend on its ability to generate revenues from outside licensing activities and secure additional funding
through the sale of its Common/Preferred Stock and/or debt securities. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will
be able to generate revenues from outside licensing activities and/or to consummate debt or equity financing in a timely manner,
or on a basis favorable to the Company, if at all. 

RESEARCH SUPPLIES 

The Company s capitalized research supplies,
which are all held by PBAG in Germany, have decreased from $236,000 at December 31, 2015 to $100,000 at September 30, 2016, primarily
due to Elafin consumptions for animal toxicity studies. 

GRANT FUNDS RECEIVABLE 

As noted previously, in June the Company received
a Grant covering eligible research and development costs. PBAG submitted for the reimbursement of eligible expenses from August
1, 2016 through September 30, 2016 approximating 81,000 Euros. As such approximately $90,000 was accrued as a grant funds receivable
on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

RECEIVABLES FROM DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT 

Receivables related to the Development Agreement
approximating $71,000 at December 31, 2015 were collected during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES 

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased
from $304,000 at December 31, 2015 to $168,000 at September 30, 2016, primarily due to the payment of 2015 year-end audit and legal
fees and other operational expenses during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

DEFERRED REVENUES 

Deferred revenues related to the Development
Agreement had a translated balance of approximately $167,000 at September 30, 2016, a $46,000 decrease from the balance at December
31, 2015. The decrease was driven by the recognition of revenues of $191,000, partly offset by additional deferrals approximating
$140,000. 

ACCRUED LICENSING FEES 

Accrued licensing fees increased from $622,000
at December 31, 2015 to $639,000 at September 30, 2016, due to a strengthening of the Euro compared to US Dollar. The Licensing
Agreement is denominated in Euros, and the accrued licensing fee was 570,000 Euros at both September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. 

OTHER LIABILITIES 

Other liabilities at September 30, 2016 and
at December 31, 2015 consist of employee compensation that was incurred in 2015 and 2016 but for which payment was agreed to be
deferred until 2018. An additional $17,000 was deferred to 2018 during the three-months ended September 30, 2016.

a)   
      designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

a)   
      all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
