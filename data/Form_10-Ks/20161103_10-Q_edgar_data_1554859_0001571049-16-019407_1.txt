CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

This quarterly report
on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include those that express plans, anticipation,
intent, contingency, goals, targets or future development and/or otherwise are not statements of historical fact. These forward-looking
statements are based on our current expectations and projections about future events and they are subject to risks and uncertainties
known and unknown that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such
statements. 

In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements by terminology, such as  expects,   anticipates,   intends, 
 estimates,   plans,   believes,   seeks,   may,   should, 
 continue,   could  or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Accordingly, these statements
involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them.
Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this report. 

You should read this
quarterly report and the documents that we reference herein and therein and have filed as exhibits to this report, completely and
with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. You should assume that the
information appearing in this quarterly report is accurate as of the date of this report only. Because the risk factors referred
to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made
by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, along
with others, are described above under the heading  Risk Factors  in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on February 26, 2016. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the
date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances
after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time
to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor
on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the information presented in this quarterly report, and particularly
our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.

1.      Basis of Presentation   

Semler Scientific, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ( Semler  or  the Company ), prepared the unaudited interim financial statements included in
this report in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial reporting. Certain information
and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read
in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016 (the  Annual Report ). The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 included
in this report has been derived from the audited financial statements included in the Annual Report. In the opinion of management,
these financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement
of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the interim
periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period, including
the full year. Items in prior period financial statements have been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation. 

2.      Going Concern   

The Company has incurred recurring
losses since inception and expects to continue to incur losses as a result of costs and expenses related to the Company s
marketing and other promotional activities, research and continued development of its products. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
has negative working capital of $1,769, cash of $517 and stockholders  deficit of $2,806. The Company s principal sources
of cash have included the issuance of equity securities, borrowings under loan agreements, revenue from leasing its product and
providing testing services. To increase revenue, the Company s operating expenses will continue to grow and, as a result,
the Company will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability. 

The Company s financial
statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared under the assumption that the Company
will continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain
additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate additional revenue. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company can give
no assurances that additional capital that the Company is able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to meet the Company s
needs. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or increase revenue from leasing its product and providing testing
services within the next twelve months to continue to fund operations at its current cash expenditure levels, the Company s
operations will need to be curtailed. The foregoing conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

3.      Assets for Lease, net   

Assets for lease consist of
the following: 

Depreciation expense amounted
to $81 and $72 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Depreciation expense amounted
to $243 and $195 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Reduction to accumulated depreciation
for returned items was $91 and $34 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Reduction
to accumulated depreciation for returned items was $208 and $75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, respectively.

Property and equipment, net
consists of the following:

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

5.    Accrued Expenses  

Accrued expenses consist of the following: 

The accumulated
offering costs that were accrued pertain to consulting fees associated with securing equity financing for the Company prior to
the initial public offering. Prior to becoming Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), the Company s current CEO performed
consulting services for the Company, which included managing finance, sales, marketing, operational and strategic planning for
the Company, as well as assistance and strategic guidance in securing financing. The Company has agreed to a payment date of December
31, 2016 for these fees. 

6.      Commitments and Contingencies   

Facilities Leases  

Facilities lease expense recognized
by the Company was $16 and $93 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Facilities lease expense recognized
by the Company was $53 and $194 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

On September 23, 2014, the Company
entered into a 36-month lease agreement for office space for the sales and marketing team located in Menlo Park, CA. The lease
term commenced February 1, 2015 and is effective through January 31, 2018. Payments required under the terms of the lease are $17.0
per month from February 2015 to January 2016, $17.5 per month from February 2016 to January 2017, and $18.0 per month from February
2017 to January 2018. The Company anticipates total future lease payments of $52.4 for the year ended December 31, 2016; $215.4
for the year ended December 31, 2017; and $18.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018. On July 15, 2015, the Company entered into
a 30-month sublease agreement for the Menlo Park office space, which commenced August 1, 2015 and is effective through the term
of the lease, January 31, 2018. Payments required to the Company under the terms of the sublease are $15.5 per month from August
2015 to July 2016, $16.0 per month from August 2016 to July 2017, and $16.5 per month from August 2017 to January 2018. The Company
anticipates receipt of total future sublease payments of $48.0 for the year ended December 31, 2016; $194.4 for the year ended
December 31, 2017; and $16.5 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company recorded an expense of $50, which represented the
difference between estimated cash payments on the lease and cash receipts from the sublease. The Company recorded the resulting
long-term liability as deferred rent on the Company s balance sheet. The cease use date is July 31, 2015.

exercise the holder would be the
beneficial owner of more than 4.99% of the Company s common stock. The relative fair value of this warrant was recorded as
a debt discount on the Company s balance sheet and partially offsets the total balance due for loans payable. As of the date

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
pricing model to determine the relative fair market value of warrants. The relative fair market value of each warrant is estimated
on the date of grant. There were no warrants issued during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The relative fair
value of the warrants granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions
for the periods presented: 

The assumptions are based on the
following for each of the years presented: 

Valuation Method   
The Company estimates the relative fair value of warrants using the Black-Scholes pricing model. 

Expected Term    The
Company uses the amount of time the warrants are exercisable per the contractual terms of the award. 

Volatility    Because
the Company has limited trading history by which to determine the volatility of its own common stock price, the expected volatility
being used is derived from the historical stock volatilities of a representative industry peer group of comparable publicly listed
companies over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the warrants. 

Risk-free Interest Rate 
  The risk-free interest rate is based on median U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected
term on the warrants. 

Expected Dividend   
The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and
therefore, used an expected dividend yield of zero in the valuation model.

into a software license financing agreement with Ascentium Capital, LLC. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company obtained a $39
loan for a 12-month term at a fixed interest rate of 8.9% per annum. to finance its upfront software licensing fee. The Company

provides for customary events of default. As of the date of this filing, the Company is in compliance with all terms of this loan.

Indemnification Obligations   

The Company enters into agreements
with customers, partners, lenders, consultants, lessors, contractors, sales representatives and parties to certain transactions
in the ordinary course of the Company s business. These agreements may require the Company to indemnify the other party against
third party claims alleging that its product infringes a patent or copyright. Certain of these agreements require the Company to
indemnify the other party against losses arising from: a breach of representations or covenants, claims relating to property damage,
personal injury or acts or omissions of the Company, its employees, agents or representatives. The Company has also agreed to indemnify
the directors and certain of the officers and employees in accordance with the by-laws of the Company. These indemnification provisions
will vary based upon the nature and terms of the agreements. In many cases, these indemnification provisions do not contain limits
on the Company s liability, and the occurrence of contingent events that will trigger payment under these indemnities is
difficult to predict. As a result, the Company cannot estimate its potential liability under these indemnities. The Company believes
that the likelihood of conditions arising that would trigger these indemnities is remote and, historically, the Company had not
made any significant payment under such indemnification provisions. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any liabilities relating
to these agreements. In certain cases, the Company has recourse against third parties with respect to the aforesaid indemnities,
and the Company believes it maintains adequate levels of insurance coverage to protect the Company with respect to potential claims
arising from such agreements. 

7.      Net Loss Per Common Share   

Because the Company was in a loss
position for each of the periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for each period
as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. The following outstanding shares of
common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including
them would have been anti-dilutive: 

8.      Stock Option Plan   

The Company s stock-based
compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of
its stockholders. Stock options have been granted to employees under the stockholder-approved 2007 Key Person Stock Option Plan
( 2007 Plan ) or the stockholder-approved 2014 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2014 Plan ). Stockholder approval
of the 2014 Plan became effective in September 2014. The 2014 Plan originally provided that the aggregate number of shares of common
stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2014 Plan may not exceed 450,000 shares (the  Share Reserve ),
however in October 2015, the stockholders approved a 1,500,000 increase to the Share Reserve. In addition, the Share Reserve automatically
increases on January 1st of each year, for a period of not more than 10 years, beginning on January 1st of the year following the
year in which the 2014 Plan became effective and ending on (and including) January 1, 2024, in an amount equal to 4% of the total
number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year. The Company s Board of Directors
may act prior to January 1st of a given year to provide that there will be no January 1st increase in the Share Reserve for such
year or that the increase in the Share Reserve for such year will be a lesser number of shares of common stock than would otherwise
occur. On January 1, 2015, the Share Reserve increased by 188,640 shares due to the automatic 4% increase. On January 1, 2016,
the Share Reserve increased by

  Unaudited  

  (In thousands, except share and per share
amounts)  

204,943 shares due to the automatic
4% increase. The Share Reserve is currently 2,343,583 shares for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

In light of stockholder approval
of the 2014 Plan, the Company no longer grants equity awards under the 2007 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, 0 shares of an aggregate
total of 407,500 shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants under the 2007 Plan and 666,121 shares of an
aggregate total of 2,343,583 shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants under the 2014 Plan. 

Aggregate intrinsic value represents
the difference between the closing market value as of September 30, 2016 of the underlying common stock and the exercise price
of outstanding, in-the-money options. A summary of the Company s stock option activity and related information for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The total compensation cost related
to unvested stock option awards not yet recognized was $639 as of September 30, 2016. The weighted average period over which the
total unrecognized compensation cost related to these unvested stock awards will be recognized is 2.27 years.  The
estimated fair value of option shares vested during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $87 and $485, respectively.
The estimated fair value of option shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $222 and $549, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $2.26 per share, or an aggregate
grant date fair value of $1,965 . There were no options granted during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  The
weighted average fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.43 per share and
$2.17 per share, respectively, or an aggregate grant date fair value of $229 and $2,161, respectively . 

On February 18, 2016 the Compensation
Committee of the Company s Board of Directors granted, and the full Board ratified, an option to acquire an aggregate of
125,000 shares under the 2014 Plan to the Company s CEO. This option vests 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date
and monthly thereafter for 36 months, such that the option is vested in full on the four-year anniversary of the grant date. On
February 18, 2016 the Company s Compensation Committee granted, and the full Board ratified, options to each of the then-seated
non-employee Directors to acquire 5,000 shares, for an aggregate of 35,000 shares, under the 2014 Plan. These options vest on the
one-year anniversary of their grant date. 

Determining the Fair Value
of Stock Options  

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the
grant. The following assumptions for the periods presented were: 

Table of Contents   

Semler Scientific, Inc.  

  Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  

  Unaudited  

  (In thousands, except share and per share
amounts)  

The assumptions are based on the
following for each of the years presented: 

Valuation Method   
The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

Expected Term    The
Company estimates the expected term consistent with the simplified method identified by the SEC. The Company elected to use the
simplified method because of its limited history of stock option exercise activity and its stock options meet the criteria of the
 plain-vanilla  options as defined by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of
the vesting and contractual terms of the award. 

Volatility    Because
the Company has limited trading history by which to determine the volatility of its own common stock price, the expected volatility
being used is derived from the historical stock volatilities of a representative industry peer group of comparable publicly listed
companies over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the options. 

Risk-free Interest Rate 
  The risk-free interest rate is based on median U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected
term on the options. 

Expected Dividend   
The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and
therefore, used an expected dividend yield of zero in the valuation model. 

Forfeiture    The
Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and records stock-based compensation
expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock-based payment awards are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. If the Company s actual forfeiture
rate is materially different from its estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what
the Company has recorded in the current period. 

The Company has recorded an expense
of $87 and $485 as it relates to stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company has recorded an expense of $222 and $549 as it relates to stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was allocated as follows based on the role and responsibility of the recipient in the Company:

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion and analysis
should be read together with our condensed unaudited financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q and with the audited financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and the information
under the headings  Risk Factors  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, or the Annual Report. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See  Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these
statements. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements
as a result of many factors, including those set forth under  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report.  

Overview  

We are an emerging
growth company that provides technology and software solutions to improve the clinical effectiveness of healthcare insurers and
physician groups. Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market innovative proprietary products and services that assist our
customers in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. In 2011, we began commercializing our first patented and U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, cleared product, which measured arterial blood flow in the extremities to aid in the diagnosis of peripheral
arterial disease, or PAD, which is associated with higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. In March 2015, we received FDA 510(k)
clearance for the next generation version of our product, QuantaFlo , which we began commercializing in August 2015. In April
2015, we launched our multi-test service platform, WellChec , to more comprehensively evaluate our customers  patients
for chronic disease, including heart attacks and strokes . However, in October 2016, we shifted our
marketing focus for WellChec   from direct contracts with health insurance plans under which we acted as the primary
WellChec  service provider to contracts to supply our software and equipment to vendors who employ medical professionals
to do annual wellness visits for health insurance plans. We believe our products position us to provide valuable information to
our customer base of insurance plans, physicians and risk assessment companies, which in turn permit them to better guide patient
care. 

In the three months
ended September 30, 2016 we had total revenue of $1,982,000 and a net loss of $362,000 compared to total revenue of $1,562,000
and a net loss of $1,580,000 in the same period in 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had total revenue of $5,118,000
and a net loss of $2,334,000 compared to total revenue of $4,067,000 and a net loss of $4,293,000 in the same period in 2015. 

Emerging Growth Company Elections  

The JOBS Act provides
that an emerging growth company, such as our company, can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new
or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until
they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption. As a result, our financial
statements may not be comparable to other public companies that comply with public company effective dates. In the future, we may
elect to opt out of the extended period for adopting new accounting standards. If we do so, we would need to disclose such decision
and it would be irrevocable. 

Factors Affecting Future Results  

We have not identified
any factors that have a recurring effect that are necessary to understand period to period comparisons as appropriate, nor any
one-time events that have an effect on the financials. We launched our WellChec  testing services platform in 2015, which
significantly impacted revenue growth and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015. We currently do not anticipate providing WellChec 
testing services as a primary vendor, but will rather focus on supplying our cardiovascular testing products to other risk assessment
service providers. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30,
2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenue   

We had revenue of $1,982,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $420,000, or 27%, compared to $1,562,000 in the same period in 2015.
Our revenue is primarily generated from per-use fees or leasing of our vascular testing systems. For licenses, we recognize revenue
monthly for each unit installed with a customer. The average amount recognized each month per unit of product in the field is affected
by the mix of units rented by direct customers or distributors, by price changes and by discounts. The primary reason for the increase
in revenue was that the total number of installed units in the field generating monthly 

Table of Contents   

revenue grew 16%, and the average amount
of revenue recognized per unit increased 17% as compared to 2015. We believe that growth in the number of monthly invoices is predominately
due to our sales and marketing efforts, which added new customers to an established customer base. Change in the average amount
of revenue recognized per unit was due to changes in the mix of customers renting units and the migration to QuantaFlo  from
its lower-priced, predecessor product. We recognized $94,000 of revenue from per-use fees, testing services and other sales during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $38,000, compared to $56,000 in the same period in 2015. We did not recognize
any revenue from WellChec  during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $104,000 in the same period in 2015. 

Operating expenses   

We had total operating
expenses of $2,237,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $877,000, or 28%, compared to $3,114,000 in
the same period in 2015. The primary reasons for the decrease were decreased general and administrative expense, sales and marketing
expense, and engineering and product development expense, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue. The changes in the
various components of our operating expenses are described below. 

Cost of revenue   

We had cost of revenue
of $398,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $13,000, or 3%, from $385,000 for the same period in
the previous year. The primary reasons for the change were an increase of $38,000 associated with employees who oversee manufacturing
and fulfillment operations, an increase of $25,000 in depreciation of other capital assets, an increase of $9,000, or 13%, in aggregate
depreciation of our vascular testing systems for lease, which corresponds to an increase in the number of installed units in the
field generating monthly depreciation charges of 18% and a decrease in average depreciation per unit per month of 5%, and an increase
of $3,000 of WellChec  event expenses. Partially offsetting these changes were lower cost of units that were retired of $48,000
and a decrease in building lease, freight and other miscellaneous items of $14,000. 

Engineering and product
development expense   

We had engineering
and product development expense of $183,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $85,000, or 32%, compared
to $268,000 in the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower salary expense of $92,000, lower other expenses
of $7,000, and lower clinical study expense of $6,000, which were partially offset by higher consulting costs for new product development
of $12,000 and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $8,000. 

Sales and marketing expense   

We had sales
and marketing expense of $950,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $364,000, or 28%, compared
to $1,314,000 in the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower travel expense of $105,000, lower
facility expense of $81,000, lower stock-based compensation expense of $50,000, lower trade show expense of $25,000,
lower other expenses of $19,000, and lower salary expense of $9,000 as compared to the same period in 2015. We also had
lower sales commissions of $74,000. However, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we reclassified $103,000
of previously recorded commission expense as a reduction to the commission accrual because such previously recorded amounts
were advances against future commissions to be earned by a sales representative. 

General and administrative
expense   

We had general and
administrative expense of $706,000 for the three months ended September 30 2016, a decrease of $441,000, or 38%, compared to $1,147,000
in the same period in 2015. The change was primarily due to lower costs associated with stock-based compensation expense of $356,000,
lower patent and legal expenses of $74,000, lower taxes and associated expense of $40,000, lower salaries and fees for employees,
directors, and consultants of $39,000, lower technical support costs of $11,000, and lower insurance premium fees of $5,000, which
changes were partially offset by higher costs for merchant fees and other expenses of $42,000, higher professional fees of $39,000,
higher expense for uncollectable accounts of $2,000, and higher travel expenses of $1,000. 

Other expense   

We had other expense
of $107,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $79,000, or 282%, compared to $28,000 in the same period
in 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense of $80,000 associated with the issuance of promissory notes
to lenders, including amortization of debt discount and interest on equipment financing agreements.

Net loss   

For the foregoing reasons,
we had a net loss of $362,000, or $0.07 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,218,000, or
77%, compared to a net loss of $1,580,000, or $0.32 per share, for the same period in 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenue   

We had revenue of $5,118,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1,051,000, or 26%, compared to $4,067,000 in the same period in 2015.
Our revenue is primarily generated from per-use fees or leasing of our vascular testing systems. For licenses, we recognize revenue
monthly for each unit installed with a customer. The average amount recognized each month per unit of product in the field is affected
by the mix of units rented by direct customers or distributors, by price changes and by discounts. The primary reason for the increase
in revenue was that the total number of installed units in the field generating monthly revenue grew 21%, and the average amount
of revenue recognized per unit increased 12% as compared to 2015. We believe that growth in the number of monthly invoices is predominately
due to our sales and marketing efforts, which added new customers to an established customer base. Change in the average amount
of revenue recognized per unit was due to changes in the mix of customers renting units and the migration to QuantaFlo  from
its lower-priced, predecessor product. We recognized $181,000 of revenue from per-use fees, testing services and other sales during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $116,000, compared to $65,000 in the same period in 2015. There was a
reduction in revenue of $162,000 for WellChec  testing services in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, partially as
an incentive to a customer to renew and expand an order for additional WellChec  services from us. We recognized $248,000
of revenue from providing testing services through our WellChec  platform during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating expenses   

We had total operating
expenses of $7,170,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,111,000, or 13%, compared to $8,281,000 in
the same period in 2015. The primary reasons for the change were decreased sales and marketing expense, general and administrative
expense, and engineering and product development expense, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue. The changes in the
various components of our operating expenses are described below. 

Cost of revenue   

We had cost of revenue
of $1,348,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $461,000, or 52%, from $887,000 for the same period
in the previous year. The primary reasons for the increase were an increase of $133,000 associated with employees who oversee manufacturing
and fulfillment operations in connection with the growth in the number of units installed. In addition, we had $80,000 more WellChec 
event expenses, and we had $43,000 increase in cost of units retired as we migrate customers to our QuantaFlo  product. A
portion of the increase is also due to the fact that aggregate depreciation of our vascular testing systems for lease increased
$48,000, or 24%, which corresponds to the 24% increase in the number of installed units in the field generating monthly depreciation
charges and an increase in average depreciation per unit per month of less than 1%. Other cost of revenue items, such as building
lease, freight and other miscellaneous items were $80,000 higher, and depreciation of other capital assets was $77,000 higher in
the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Engineering and product
development expense   

We had engineering
and product development expense of $634,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $349,000, or 36%, compared
to $983,000 in the same period in 2015. The change was primarily due to decreased salary expense of $122,000, lower clinical study
expense of $117,000, lower consulting costs for new product development of $110,000, and lower other expenses of $20,000, which
were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $19,000 and travel expense of $1,000. 

Sales and marketing expense   

We had sales
and marketing expense of $2,952,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $857,000, or 23%,
compared to $3,809,000 in the same period in 2015. The change was primarily due to lower salary expense of $198,000, lower
travel expense of $181,000, lower facility expense of $165,000, lower trade show expense of $97,000, lower other
expenses of $37,000, and lower stock-based compensation expense of $32,000 as compared to the same period in 2015. We also
had lower sales commissions of $147,000. However, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reclassified $103,000
of previously recorded commission expense as a reduction to the commission accrual because such previously recorded amounts
were advances against future commissions to be earned by a sales representative.

General and administrative
expense   

We had general and
administrative expense of $2,236,000 for the nine months ended September 30 2016, a decrease of $366,000, or 14%, compared to $2,602,000
in the same period in 2015. The change was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense of $313,000, lower taxes and
associated expense of $164,000, lower patent and legal expenses of $80,000, lower expense for uncollectable accounts of $52,000,
lower insurance premium fees of $29,000, lower salaries and fees for employees, directors, and consultants of $21,000, and lower
travel expenses of $2,000, which decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with professional fees of $183,000,
higher merchant fees and other expenses of $87,000, and higher technical support of $25,000. 

Other expense   

We had other expense
of $282,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $203,000, or 257%, compared to $79,000 in the same period
in 2015. The change was primarily due to higher interest expense of $201,000 associated with the issuance of promissory notes to
lenders and higher credit card fees associated with our corporate credit card of $2,000. 

Net loss   

For the foregoing reasons,
we had a net loss of $2,334,000, or $0.46 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,959,000, or
46%, compared to a net loss of $4,293,000, or $0.87 per share, for the same period in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We had cash of $517,000
at September 30, 2016 compared to $405,000 at December 31, 2015, and total current liabilities of $3,317,000 at September
30, 2016 compared to $4,108,000 at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016 we had negative working capital of approximately
$1,769,000. 

In January 2016, we
borrowed an aggregate of $1,500,000 from Mr. William H.C. Chang pursuant to two separate promissory notes and also issued two 2-year
warrants to acquire an aggregate 228,572 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.75 per share. On March 31, 2016,
we borrowed $700,000 from an accredited investor pursuant to a promissory note and also issued a 2-year warrant to acquire an aggregate
79,459 shares of our common stock at $1.85 per share. On April 5, 2016, we borrowed $160,000 from the same accredited investor
pursuant to a promissory note and also issued a 2-year warrant to acquire an aggregate of 18,162 shares of our common stock at
$1.85 per share. On May 20, 2016, we borrowed $80,000 from the same accredited investor pursuant to a promissory note and also
issued a 2-year warrant to acquire an aggregate of 9,081 shares of our common stock at $1.85 per share. In July 2016 we entered
into some software and equipment financing arrangements. Please see   Description of Indebtedness  for additional
information regarding these loans. 

We have incurred recurring
losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses as a result of costs and expenses related to our marketing and other
promotional activities, research and continued development of our products and services. Our principal sources of cash have included
the issuance of equity, including our February 2014 initial public offering of common stock, and to a lesser extent, recent private
placement offerings of common stock, borrowings under loan agreements, the issuance of promissory notes, and revenue from leasing
our product and selling our testing services. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to grow in order to grow our
revenues and, as a result, we will need to generate significant additional net revenues to achieve profitability. For these reasons,
our independent registered public accountants  report for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph
that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a  going concern.  This doubt continues to exist. 

Although we do not
have any current capital commitments, we expect that we may increase our expenditures to continue our efforts to grow our business
and commercialize our products and services. Accordingly, we currently expect to make additional expenditures in both sales and
marketing, and invest in our corporate infrastructure. We also expect to invest in our research and development efforts. We do
not have any definitive plans as to the exact amounts or particular uses at this time, and the exact amounts and timing of any
expenditure may vary significantly from our current intentions. However, in order to execute on our business plan, and given our
current available cash, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital. To improve operating cash flow, in 2015, we
implemented measures to reduce expenses and renegotiated longer payment terms in our existing contracts. There is no assurance
that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms
or whether or not we will generate sufficient revenues to become profitable and have positive operating cash flow. If we are unable
to raise sufficient additional funds when necessary, we may need to curtail making additional expenditures and could be required
to scale back our business plans, or make other changes until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations.
There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.

Operating activities   

We used $1,906,000
of net cash in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to
net cash used in operating activities plus changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $428,000 of cash in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. These non-cash adjustments primarily reflect depreciation of $336,000, stock-based compensation expense
of $222,000, loss on disposal of assets for lease of $149,000, amortization of debt discount costs of $133,000, and allowance for
doubtful accounts of $66,000. Cash used in operating activities was primarily from trade accounts payable of $558,000, deferred
revenue of $285,000, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $80,000, partially offset by net cash provided by trade accounts
receivable of $315,000 and accrued expenses of $130,000. 

For the same period
in 2015, we used $2,491,000 of net cash in operating activities. Non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in
operating activities plus changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $1,802,000 of cash in the nine months ended September
30, 2015. These non-cash adjustments primarily reflect stock-based compensation expense of $549,000, depreciation of $211,000,
allowance for doubtful accounts of $119,000, loss on disposal of assets for lease of $106,000, and amortization of deferred financing
costs and debt discounts of $55,000. Cash used in operating activities was primarily from trade accounts receivable of $203,000,
and accounts payable of $28,000, partially offset by net cash provided by deferred revenue of $716,000, accrued expenses of $237,000,
and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $40,000. 

Investing activities   

We used $555,000 of
net cash in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from purchases of assets for lease of
$415,000 and fixed asset purchases of $140,000. We generated $1,421,000 of net cash in investing activities for the same period
in 2015, primarily from a change in restricted cash of $2,100,000, partially offset by purchases of assets for lease of $484,000
and fixed asset purchases of $195,000. 

Financing activities   

We generated $2,573,000
in net cash in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to proceeds from loans payable of $2,590,000,
partially offset by payments of loans payable of $17,000. We used $1,161,000 of net cash from financing activities during the same
period in 2015, primarily from payments of loans of $2,000,000 and offering costs of $174,000, partially offset by $999,000 from
the sale of shares of our common stock and $14,000 from exercise of stock options. 

Description of Indebtedness  

I n
January 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $1,500,000 from William H.C. Chang, a significant stockholder, pursuant to two separate
2-year promissory notes. The notes bear simple interest  ($1.0 million at a rate of 10% per annum, and $0.5 million at 5%
per annum) and mature in two years, with all principal and accrued but unpaid interest payable at maturity. We may prepay the notes
at any time prior to maturity without penalty. The notes must be repaid prior to maturity in the event of default, and we agreed
not to incur additional indebtedness in excess of $50,000 without the lender s prior consent, which is not to be unreasonably
withheld. In connection therewith, we issued the Chang Family Trust a two-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 228,372 shares
of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.75 per share. The warrants may not be exercised, however, absent receipt of stockholder
approval, if after such exercise the holder would be the beneficial owner of more than 19.99% of our common stock. 

I n
March 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $700,000 from an accredited investor, pursuant to a two-year promissory note. The note
bears simple interest  at a rate of 10% per annum and matures in two years, with all principal and accrued but unpaid interest
payable at maturity. The notes may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity without penalty. The notes must be repaid prior to
maturity in the event of default. In connection therewith, we issued a two-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 79,459 shares
of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.85 per share. The warrants may not be exercised, however, absent receipt of stockholder
approval, if after such exercise the holder would be the beneficial owner of more than 4.99% of our common stock 

I n
April 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $160,000 from an accredited investor, pursuant to a two-year promissory note. The note
bears simple interest  at a rate of 10% per annum and matures in two years, with all principal and accrued but unpaid interest
payable at maturity. The notes may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity without penalty. The notes must be repaid prior to
maturity in the event of default. In connection therewith, we issued a two-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 18,162 shares
of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.85 per share. The warrants may not be exercised, however, absent receipt of stockholder
approval, if after such exercise the holder would be the beneficial owner of more than 4.99% of our common stock. 

I n
May 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $80,000 from an accredited investor, pursuant to a two-year promissory note. The note bears
simple interest  at a rate of 10% per annum and matures in two years, with all principal and accrued but unpaid interest 

Table of Contents   

payable at maturity. The notes may be prepaid
at any time prior to maturity without penalty. The notes must be repaid prior to maturity in the event of default. In connection
therewith, we issued a two-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 9,081 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.85
per share. The warrants may not be exercised, however, absent receipt of stockholder approval, if after such exercise the holder
would be the beneficial owner of more than 4.99% of our common stock. 

In addition to the above,
we have also entered into other debt financing arrangements, including equipment and software financing arrangements. See Note
6 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for a description of our outstanding indebtedness. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of each of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Commitments and Contingencies  

As of each of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, other than employment/consulting agreements with key executive officers and our facilities lease
obligation, we had no material commitments other than the liabilities reflected in our financial statements. 

JOBS Act  

In April 2012, the
JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition
period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves
of this extended transition period, and, as a result, we will not adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates
on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

In evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and our vice president, finance, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer
and our vice president, finance concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance
level as of the end of the period covered by that report, to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our chief executive officer and our vice president, finance as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, due to the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

In an effort to remediate
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, in early 2016 we began adopting and implementing policies
and procedures with respect to the review, supervision, and monitoring of our accounting and reporting functions. We will continue
assessing our procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Other than these changes, there have been no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting during our third fiscal quarter of 2016.
