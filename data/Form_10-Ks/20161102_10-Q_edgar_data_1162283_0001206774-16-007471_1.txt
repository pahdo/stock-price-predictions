       Basis of Presentation    

Morgan Group Holding
      Co. ( Holding  or  the Company ) was incorporated in November 2001 as a
      wholly-owned subsidiary of LICT Corporation ( LICT ) to serve, among other
      business purposes, as a holding company for LICT s controlling interest in
      The Morgan Group, Inc. ( Morgan ). On January 24, 2002, LICT spun off
      2,820,051 shares of Holding common stock through a pro rata distribution
      ( Spin-Off ) to its stockholders and retained 235,294 shares.  
        The accompanying
      unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance
      with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for
      interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
      Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
      information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
      accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the
      opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
      accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
      Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
      are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
      year ending December 31, 2016. The preparation of financial statements in
      conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
      States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
      the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
      Actual results could differ from these estimates.     

Note
      2.  
      
       Significant Accounting Policies    

All highly liquid
      investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased are
      considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of a cash equivalent
      approximates its fair value based on its nature.       
        At September 30,
      2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, all cash and cash
      equivalents were invested in a United States Treasury money market fund,
      of which an affiliate of the Company serves as the investment manager.
        
        The Company may from
      time to time invest in marketable securities that are bought and held
      principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term and are
      classified as trading securities. Trading securities are recorded at fair
      value on the balance sheet in current assets, with the change in fair
      value during the period included in earnings.  
        Basic earnings per
      share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
      during each period. Diluted earnings per share is based on basic shares
      plus the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise
      of in-the-money stock options and unvested restricted stock using the
      treasury stock method and, if dilutive.     

Note
      3.  
      
       Income Taxes    

The Company is a  C 
      corporation for Federal tax purposes, and has provided for deferred income
      taxes for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
      bases of its assets and liabilities. The Company has recorded a full
      valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset of approximately
      $244,059 arising from its temporary basis differences and tax loss
      carryforward, as its realization is dependent upon the generation of
      future taxable income during the period when such losses would be
      deductible.  
        Pursuant to Sections
      382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, annual use of any of the
      Company s net operating loss carry forwards may be limited if cumulative
      changes in ownership of more than 50% occur during any three year period.

Note
      4.  
      
       Commitments and Contingencies    

From time to time the
      Company may be subject to certain asserted and unasserted claims. It is
      the Company s belief that the resolution of these matters will not have a
      material adverse effect on its financial position.  
        The Company has not
      guaranteed any of the obligations of Morgan and believes it currently has
      no commitment or obligation to fund any
creditors.

       Shareholders  Equity and Stock Options and
      Warrants    

At the Company s
      Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 8, 2014, its stockholders voted to
      amend the Company s Certificate of Incorporation (the  Charter Amendment )
      to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value
      $0.01 per share, from 10,000,000 to 100,000,000. In order to economize
      costs until necessary, the Company has not yet filed the Amended
      Certificate of Incorporation   
         with its state of
      incorporation, Delaware, to effectuate the authorization.  
        On December 21, 2012,
      the Company and Jonathan P. Evans, Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
      entered into a Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement, whereby the Company
      granted to Mr. Evans an option (the  Option ) to purchase 800,000 shares
      of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.15 per share of
      Common Stock, which was the closing price of the Common Stock as quoted on
      the OTC Markets  inter-dealer quotation service on December 20, 2012.
      These options were exercisable at any time and the exercise period expired
      on December 21, 2015. As of September 30, 2015, these were the only
      options outstanding and as of September 30, 2016, there are no options
      outstanding.   
        On December 21, 2012,
      the Company issued a warrant to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the
      Company s Common Stock at $1.00 per share to Jonathan P. Evans in exchange
      for $10,000, which was received in 2013. In addition on that date, the
      Company issued a warrant to purchase up to 200,000 shares of the Company s
      Common Stock to Robert E. Dolan, Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
      in exchange for $2,000. Both warrants are exercisable currently through
      December 21, 2017.      
   Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations   
   Overview    
  The Company currently has
no operating businesses and is actively seeking acquisitions as part of its
strategic alternatives. Its only costs are the expenses required to make the
regulatory filings needed to maintain its public status and to find and evaluate
potential acquisitions. These costs are estimated at $50,000 to $100,000 per
year.  
   Results of Operations
   
   Three Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015    
  For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $11,230 of administrative expenses, a
decrease of $1,445 from the $12,675 of administrative expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was essentially due to lower legal
costs in 2016 for acquisition projects.  
  During the third quarter of
2016, the Company earned $44 from its investment in a United States Treasury
money market fund. No amounts were earned during the third quarter of 2015 due
to lack of earnings by the fund.  
   Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015    
  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $47,421 of administrative expenses, a
decrease of $3,419 from the $50,840 of administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was essentially due to lower legal
costs in 2016 for acquisition projects and lower costs for making the Company s
regulatory filings in 2016.  
  During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company earned $144 from its investment in a
United States Treasury money market fund. No amounts were earned during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 due to lack of earnings by the fund.  

  9   

Liquidity and Capital
Resources    
  As of September 30, 2016,
the Company s principal assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents of
$67,682.   
  The Company has adopted a
growth strategy to acquire US-based businesses of an appropriate type and size.
The execution of such a strategy may require the Company to obtain significantly
more financial resources than it currently possesses. Those resources could take
the form of debt and equity offerings, or potentially a hybrid instrument. There
is no assurance that the Company can obtain such financial resources to
successfully implement this strategy.  
  At the Company s Annual
Meeting of Stockholders on May 8, 2014, its stockholders voted to amend the
Company s Certificate of Incorporation (the  Charter Amendment ) to increase the
number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, from
10,000,000 to 100,000,000. This Charter Amendment gives the Company greater
flexibility in considering and planning for future corporate needs, including,
but not limited to, possible future capital raising activities, potential
strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, and business
combinations, as well as other general corporate transactions. Such transactions
may be undertaken with affiliates of the Company or unaffiliated third parties.
The Board believes that additional authorized shares of common stock will enable
the Company to take timely advantage of market conditions and favorable
financing and acquisition opportunities that become available.  
  The Company has no current
plan, commitment, arrangement, understanding or agreement regarding the issuance
of the additional shares of common stock that will result from the Company s
adoption of this Charter Amendment.   
  The Company has not yet
filed the Amended Certificate of Incorporation with its state of incorporation,
Delaware.  
   Off Balance Sheet
Arrangements   
  None.   
   Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Analysis of Market Risk    
  The Company is a smaller
reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K and thus is not
required to report the Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Market Risk
specified in Item 305 of Regulation S-K.         
   Item 4. Controls and
Procedures    
  (a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures      
  Our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Act )) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were
designed and were functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that
the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under
the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
Company believes that a controls system, no matter how well designed and
operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls
system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have
been detected.  
  (b)    Changes in Internal Controls      
  During the period covered
by this report, there have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our financial statements.  
   Forward Looking
Discussion      
  This report contains a
number of forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements
regarding the prospective adequacy of the Company s liquidity and capital
resources in the near term. From time to time, the Company may make other oral
or written forward-looking statements regarding its anticipated operating
revenues, costs and expenses, earnings and other matters affecting its
operations and condition. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a
number of material factors, which could cause the statements or projections
contained therein to be materially inaccurate. Such factors include the
estimated administrative expenses of the Company on a going-forward
basis.

   Rule 13a-14(a)
Certification of the Chief Executive Officer    
  I, Jonathan P. Evans,
certify that:   
  1. I have reviewed this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Morgan Group Holdings Co.;   
  2. Based on my knowledge,
this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
to the period covered by this report;   
  3. Based on my knowledge,
the financial statements, and other financial information included in this
report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
presented in this report;   
  4. The registrant's other
certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f)) for the registrant and have:
  
  Designed such disclosure
controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be
designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
the registrant is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
during the period in which this report is being prepared;   
  Designed such internal
control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial
reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.   
  Evaluated the effectiveness
of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this
report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
evaluation; and   
  Disclosed in this report
any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's
fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
internal control over financial reporting; and   
  5. The registrant's other
certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the
audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
the equivalent functions):   
  (a) All significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and   
  (b) Any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

  2. Based on my knowledge,
this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
presented in this report;   
  4. The registrant's other

disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f)) for the registrant and have:
  
  (a)     Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant is made known to us
by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this
report is being prepared;   
  (b)     Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.   
  (c)     Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered
by this report based on such evaluation; and   
  (d)     Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent
fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual
report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and
  
  5. The registrant's other
certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the
audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
the equivalent functions):  
  (a) All significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and   
  (b) Any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
