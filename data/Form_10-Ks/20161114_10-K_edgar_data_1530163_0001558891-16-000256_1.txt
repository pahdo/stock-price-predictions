Statements    

Certain
statements contained in this report, including statements regarding our business, financial condition, our intent, belief or current
expectations, primarily with respect to the future operating performance of the Company and and other statements contained herein
regarding matters that are not historical facts, are  forward-looking  statements. You can identify forward-looking
statements by those that are not historical in nature, particularly those that use terminology such as  may,   will, 
 should,   expects,   anticipates,   contemplates,   estimates,   believes, 
 plans,   projected,   predicts,   potential,  or  continue  or the
negative of these similar terms. Future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, future press releases and future
oral or written statements made by us or with our approval, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain forward-looking
statements. Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements.  

All
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update such statements
to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made, except as required by federal
securities and any other applicable law.  

Overview   

We
were incorporated on May 8, 2007 in the State of Nevada. We are a development stage company that was originally established to
offer eco-friendly health and wellness products to the general public via the internet. As we had previously disclosed, on November
20, 2012, we entered into a binding letter of intent ( LOI ) with Real Aesthetic, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( Real
Aesthetic ), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for common stock of the Company.
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the LOI was subject to the completion of the due diligence investigation of both
parties, execution and delivery of documentation for the transaction, consents from the respective boards of directors of both
companies and any third parties and the delivery of audited financial statements by Real Aesthetic. Subsequently, we decided not
to pursue the contemplated transaction with Real Aesthetic.   

On
June 28, 2013, FINRA confirmed the 15-1 forward stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock authorized
by our Board of Directors. The record date of the split was July 8, 2013. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual
Report and the financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted for the stock split.  

On
February 16, 2016, the Registrant filed a Preliminary Information Statement on Schedule 14C for the purpose of increasing its
authorized capital stock, disclosing as its reason  to facilitate our ability to raise capital in furtherance of our
business plan   We also disclosed at that time that  we have no present plans, nor have we entered into
any agreements or understandings, that may require the issuance of any of the newly-authorized Common Stock....our Board of Directors
and Majority Consenting Stockholder have determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and all our stockholders to
have available authorized but unissued shares . . .   

Since
February 2016, the Registrant s Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a new  wholly-owned Israeli
subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewals Ltd ( Bengio Urban ) to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development,
particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in Israel. To that end, the Registrant raised $150,000 from the sale of restricted
shares to investors to fund the new real estate development operations of Bengio Urban, which has recently hired employees
and has signed contracts with the current tenants of three buildings who have agreed to vacate the buildings so that they can
be redeveloped into modern state of the art new residential buildings .  Based upon the foregoing, the Registrant no longer
deems itself to be a shell company.  

We
believe, based upon the current real estate market in Israel, that urban renewal projects present an excellent opportunity for
us to generate revenues and profits which we expect to realize during our 2017 fiscal year. The basis for our belief is that in
several major Israeli cities, there is virtually no more room to grow. As a result, several municipal governments have allowed
older buildings to be renovated, thereby giving their respective cities the opportunity to develop new apartments to be added
to or replacing existing buildings.   

Additionally,
municipalities have express their concern that many buildings constructed before 1980 will be unable to withstand earthquakes.
In Israel, very few apartment buildings are owned by a single person or entity and since the majority of apartments within buildings
are privately owned, the burden to renovate buildings in order to render them safer in the event of a major earthquake primarily
falls on the the multiple owners of various apartment buildings and complexes.   

Tama
38  is an Israeli national zoning plan whereby a contractor assumes the responsibility of renovating an apartment building.
In exchange for covering all costs of renovations, securing building permits and paying requisite taxes, the contractor has is
granted the right to build additional floors to the existing building and sell the apartments built on these floors.   

The
apartment owners benefit by receiving a modernized building, strengthened against earthquakes, as well as the additional apartments
added to their buildings. In some cases balconies, storage rooms, parking spaces and elevators may be added as well, further enhancing
the building s value.  

Pinui
Binui  projects are defined as development where the residents of apartments are temporarily evacuated so that the buildings
may be demolished and rebuilt.  The tenants then return to new apartments in the newly finished and renovated building. 
The contractor pays all costs for demolition, construction, relocating apartment owners and renting their temporary homes during
construction.  In exchange, the contractor adds new apartments in the building which are sold to generate profit.  

As
with  Tama 38,  the value of the apartments in the building is increased thereby benefitting the owners and the tenants
return to a new, often larger and safer apartment in a building often with more amenities.  

Competition   

There
are several Companies in Israel engaged in TAMA 38 however , the Company will continue to be at a significant competitor vis-a-vis
the Company's competitors.  

Regulation
and Taxation   

The
Investment Company Act of 1940 defines an  investment company  as an issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged
primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading of securities. While the Company does not intend to engage in such
activities, the Company could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the event the Company obtains
or continues to hold a minority interest in a number of development stage enterprises. The Company could be expected to incur
significant registration and compliance costs if required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, management
will continue to review the Company's activities from time to time with a view toward reducing the likelihood the Company could
be classified as an  investment company.   

Employees   

The
Company currently has three employees.

Item
3. Legal Proceedings   

There
are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company,
any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a
party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. The Company s property is not the subject

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements, which are included elsewhere
in this Form 10-K.  

Overview    

We
were a shell company that was originally established to offer eco-friendly health and wellness products to the general public
via the internet. As we had previously disclosed, on November 20, 2012, we entered into the LOI with Real Aesthetic to acquire
all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for common stock of the Company. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by the LOI was subject to the completion of the due diligence investigation of both parties, execution and delivery
of documentation for the transaction, consents from the respective boards of directors of both companies and any third parties
and the delivery of audited financial statements by Real Aesthetic. Subsequently, we decided not to pursue the contemplated transaction
with Real Aesthetic.  

Plan
of Operation   

The
Registrant has recently determined, through its recently established, wholly-owned new Israeli subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewals
Ltd to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development, particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in
Israel. We believe, based upon the current real estate market in Israel, that urban renewal projects present an opportunity for
us to generate revenues and profits, which we have never experienced since our inception.  The basis for our belief is that
in several major Israeli cities, there is virtually no more room to grow. As a result, several municipal governments have allowed
older buildings to be renovated, thereby giving their respective cities the opportunity to develop new apartments to be added
to or replacing existing buildings.   

Additionally,
municipalities have express their concern that many buildings constructed before 1980 will be unable to withstand earthquakes.
In Israel, very few apartment buildings are owned by a single person or entity and since the majority of apartments within buildings
are privately owned, the burden to renovate buildings in order to render them safer in the event of a major earthquake primarily
falls on the the multiple owners of various apartment buildings and complexes.   

Tama

Results
of Operations   

For
the years ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015    

Revenues    

The
Company did not generate any revenues during the years ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015  

Total
operating expenses    

During
the year ended July 31, 2016, total operating expenses were $325,350, which consisted of professional fees , general and administrative
expenses and expenses relating to the new business operations in relation to Tama 38. During the year ended July 31, 2015, total
operating expenses were $57,418, which consisted of professional fees , general and administrative expenses and consulting fees.  

Net
loss    

During
the year ended July 31, 2016 and July 31 2015 , the Company had a net loss of $357,998 and $63,489 respectively ..  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of July 31, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $53,609.  

The
Company believes that its current cash is insufficient to fund its expenses over the next twelve months. There can be no assurance
that additional capital will be available to the Company. The Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings
with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Since the Company has no such arrangements
or plans currently in effect, its inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on its ability
to remain a viable company.  

Going
Concern Consideration   

The
Company had no revenues and incurred a net loss of $357,998 for the year ended July 31, 2016 and a net loss of $63,489 for the
year ended July 31, 2015. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. Our financial statements do not include
any adjustments that may be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

For
revenue from product sales, the Company will recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue
Recognition  (SAB No. 104), which superseded Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements  (SAB No. 101). SAB No. 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgment regarding
the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts
and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowance, and other adjustments will be provided for in the same period the related
sales are recorded.  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

REPORT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS  

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 of Darkstar Ventures Inc.: 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Darkstar Ventures
Inc. (a Nevada corporation) as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders  equity,
and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Darkstar Ventures Inc. as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has not established
any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As such, it has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of
July 31, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan regarding these
matters is also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

VENTURES, INC.   

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE
1 - GENERAL  

Darkstar
Ventures, Inc. ( the Company  or  we ) was incorporated on May 8, 2007 under the laws of the State of
Nevada.   

The
Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Bengio Urban Renewals Ltd ( Bengio )., to focus its limited
resources in the area of real estate development, particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in Israel.  

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding
to operationalize the Company s current business plan.  

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN  

The
Company has not commenced planned principal operations. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $599,125 as of July31, 2016.
In addition, the Company continues to havenegative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that
funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional
capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force
the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that
they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing stockholders.  

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

a.      Functional
                                         currency     

The
functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar ( $  or  dollar ), which is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the operations of the Company are conducted. The functional currency of its foreign subsidiary is
the New Israeli Shekel ( NIS ).  

The
financial statements of the subsidiary were translated into dollars in accordance with the relevant standards of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ). Accordingly, assets and liabilities were translated from NIS to $ using year-end
exchange rates and income and expense items were translated at average exchange rates during the year.  

Gains
or losses resulting from translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders' deficit, under  accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) .  

Balances
denominated in, or linked to foreign currency are stated on the basis of the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

b.      Principles
                                         of consolidation     

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Inter-company balances
and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

c.      Cash
                                         equivalents     

Cash
equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments which include short term bank deposit (up to three months from date of deposit),
that are not restricted as to withdrawals or use that are readily convertible to cash with maturities of three months or less
as of the date acquired.  

The
company s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major banking institutions in Israel.  

d.      Use
                                         of estimates     

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates  

e.      Share-base
                                         payments     

Share-based
payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the options issued and amortized over the vesting periods. Share-based
payments to non-employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued if it is determined the fair value of the goods or services cannot be reliably measured, and are recorded at the date the
goods or services are received. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards expected to vest.
The offset to the recorded cost is to share-based payments reserve. Consideration received on the exercise of stock options is
recorded as capital stock and the related share-based payments reserve is transferred to share capital.  

f.      Loss
                                         per share     

Net
loss per share, basic and diluted, is computed on the basis of the net loss for the period divided by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common
shares and of common shares equivalents outstanding when dilutive. Common share equivalents include: (i) outstanding stock options
under the Company s share incentive plan and warrants which are included under the treasury share method when dilutive,
and (ii) common shares to be issued under the assumed conversion of the Company s outstanding convertible notes, which are
included under the if-converted method when dilutive. The computation of diluted net loss per share for the years ended July 31,
2016 and 2015, does not include common share equivalents, since such inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  

g.      Deferred
                                         income taxes     

Deferred
taxes are determined utilizing the asset and liability method based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between
the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities under the applicable tax laws. Deferred tax balances are computed
using the tax rates expected to be in effect when those differences reverse. A valuation allowance in respect of deferred tax
assets is provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets.  

h.      Fair
                                         value measurements      

The
Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based
risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent
in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the
lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:  

Level
1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2    Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3    Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  

In
accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.  

As
of July 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated
fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments  

i.       Newly
                                         issued accounting pronouncements :     

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers to clarify
the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature,
amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and
quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized
from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017 using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the
standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach
with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote
disclosures). Early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When
the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (ASU 2014-12),
which requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period,
be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair
value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes
probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s)
for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-12
in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  (ASU 2015-11), which changes the
subsequent measurement of inventory from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The new standard is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is
permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that this updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements
and footnote disclosures.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  (ASU 2015-17), which requires
that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The new standard is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to recognize
on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a corresponding
lease liability for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative
disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and is required to be applied
with a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this
standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  (ASU 2016-09), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification
in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this updated
standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments , which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects
expected credit losses. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that this updated standard will have
on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the
statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently assessing the
impact that this updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

On
April 14, 2016 the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of 270,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of
the Company to Avraham Bengio, the Company's shareholder, Sole Director, CEO and CFO in consideration for the conversion of $270,000

NOTE
7 - LONG TERM LOAN:   

On
February 28, 2016, Bengio and TCSM INC signed a loan agreement according to which TCSM would grant the Company a loan of up to
$256,016 (NIS 1,000,000) in two installments of which $222,048 (NIS 850,000) was received as of the balance sheet date. The loan

NOTE
8 - INCOME TAXES:   

At
July 31, 2016 the Company had available net-operating loss carryforwards for Federal tax purposes of approximately $324,000, which
may be applied againstfuture taxable income, if any, through 2035.Certain significant changes in ownership of the Company may
restrict the future utilization of these tax loss carryforwards.  

At
July 31, 2015 the Company had a deferred tax asset of approximately $110,000 representing the benefit of its net operating loss
carryforwards. The Company has not recognized the tax benefit because realization of the tax benefit is uncertain and thus a valuation
allowance has been fully provided against the deferred tax asset. The difference between the Federal Statutory Rate of 34% and
the Company s effective tax rate of 0% is due to an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $36,000 and $20,000
for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
Company s subsidiary has estimated total available carryforward operating tax losses for Israeli income tax purposes of
approximately $22,000 as of July 31,2016, which may be carryforward to offset against future income for an indefinite period of
time.  

The
Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability.  

The
Company had no accrued penalties and interest related to taxes as of July 31, 2016.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures   

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS   

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure
controls and procedures  (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e))
as of July 31, 2016, the end of the period covered by this annual report, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  

MANAGEMENT S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive, principal operating and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s
assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting at July 31, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment
under those criteria, management has determined that, as of July 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.  

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant
to the exemption provided to issuers that are not  large accelerated filers  nor  accelerated filers 
under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Potential
Conflicts of Interest    

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed
by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers
have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions.
We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors.  

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance    

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires executive officers and directors of the Company and persons who own more
than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in their ownership
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and forward copies of such filings to the Company. All of our executive officers
and directors have complied with the Section 16(a) filing requirements.  

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings    

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred within the past ten years concerning our directors, or control persons which involved
a criminal conviction, a criminal proceeding, an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one's participation in the securities
or banking industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations.  

Item
11. Executive Compensation.   

Outstanding
Equity Awards    

Since
our incorporation on May 8, 2007, none of our directors or executive officers has held unexercised options, stock that had not
vested, or equity incentive plan awards.  

Compensation
of Directors    

During
the fiscal year ending July 31, 2016, the company paid the CEO compensation of $150,000 (including $120,000 in equity compensation)  

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.   

The
following table lists, as of November 14, 2016, the number of shares of common stock of our Company that are beneficially owned
by (i) each person or entity known to our Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding common stock;
(ii) each executive officer and director of our Company; and (iii) all executive officers and directors as a group. Information
relating to beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal shareholders and management is based upon information furnished
by each person using  beneficial ownership  concepts under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under
these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes
the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting
of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire
beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, more than one person may be deemed to
be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he
or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below, each person has sole voting and investment power.  

The
percentages below are calculated based on 647,345,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of October 26, 2016.
We do not have any outstanding options, warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common
stock.  

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.   

During
the fiscal year ending July 31 2016 the Company issued 270,000,000 restricted stock in exchange and in conversion of the officer
loans to its sole officer and director. The Company also issued 120,000,000 shares to its director as salary compensation for
the fiscal year ending July 31 2016.  

Director
Independence    

We
are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national securities association and, as a result,
we are not at this time required to have our board comprised of a majority of  independent directors.  We do not believe
that any of our directors currently meet the definition of  independent  as promulgated by the rules and regulations
of the American Stock Exchange.  

Item
14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services.   

Our
principal independent accountants are Weinberg and Bear LLC. The pre-approved fees billed to the Company are set forth below:  

As
of July 31, 2016, the Company did not have a formal documented pre-approval policy for the fees of the principal accountant. The
Company does not have an audit committee. The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's engagement to audit our
financial statements for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal
accountant's full-time, permanent employees was 0%.
