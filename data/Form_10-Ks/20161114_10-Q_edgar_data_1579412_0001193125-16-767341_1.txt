September 30, 2016, the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, was 0.85% and the U.S. Prime Lending Rate, or Prime, was 3.50%.

  Security or portion thereof held within Burholme Funding LLC and is pledged as collateral supporting the amounts outstanding under the prime brokerage facility with BNP
Paribas Prime Brokerage, Inc., or BNPP. Securities held within Burholme Funding LLC may be rehypothecated from time to time as permitted under Rule 15c-1(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, subject to the
terms and conditions governing the prime brokerage facility with BNPP (see Note 8).

other than qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company s total assets. As of September 30, 2016, 80.7% of the Company s total assets represented qualifying assets.
In addition, as described in Note 8, the Company also calculates its compliance with the qualifying asset test on a  look through  basis by disregarding the value of the Company s total return swap and treating each loan underlying
the total return swap as either a qualifying asset or non-qualifying asset based on whether the obligor is an eligible portfolio company. On this basis, 77.2% of the Company s total assets represented qualifying assets as of September 30, 2016.

Organization       FS Investment Corporation III, or the Company, was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the
State of Maryland on June 7, 2013 and formally commenced investment operations on April 2, 2014 upon raising gross proceeds in excess of $2,500, or the minimum offering requirement, from sales of shares of its common stock in its

amended, or the Advisers Act, and an affiliate of the Company. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, the Company had no operations except for matters relating to its organization.   
  The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a
business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, the Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated
investment company, or RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had seven wholly-owned financing subsidiaries and three wholly-owned subsidiaries through
which it holds interests in non-controlled portfolio companies. The unaudited consolidated financial statements include both the Company s accounts and the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. One of the Company s consolidated subsidiaries is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes.      The Company s investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans
of private U.S. companies. The Company seeks to generate superior risk-adjusted returns by focusing on debt investments in a broad array of private U.S. companies, including middle market companies, which the Company defines as companies with annual
revenues of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment. The Company may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the
 over-the-counter  market or directly from the Company s target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with the Company s debt investments, the Company may on occasion receive equity
interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. The Company may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in target companies, in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and
warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity. Any such minority interests are generally acquired in conjunction with one of the Company s debt investments or
through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of the Company s portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, other
debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps.       Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies        Basis of Presentation : The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair

presentation have been included. For a more complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other information, the Company s interim unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet and
consolidated schedule of investments are derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The Company is considered an investment company under GAAP and follows the
accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies under Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-08,  Financial Services Investment Companies . The Company has evaluated the impact of subsequent events through the date the
consolidated financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.       Use
of Estimates : The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Many of the amounts have been rounded, and
all amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts.       Capital Gains Incentive Fee : The Company entered
into an investment advisory and administrative services agreement with FSIC III Advisor, dated as of December 20, 2013, which was amended and restated on August 6, 2014, and which, as amended and restated, is referred to herein as the investment
advisory and administrative services agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or
upon termination of such agreement). Such fee will equal 20.0% of the Company s incentive fee capital gains (i.e., the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable
period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues for the capital
gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.      While the investment
advisory and administrative services agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, or AICPA, Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, the Company includes unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the
incentive fees that would be payable to FSIC III Advisor if the Company s entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though FSIC III Advisor is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized
gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.      Based on an interpretation of the applicable language in the
Advisers Act by the staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC, the Company  looks through  its total return swap, or TRS, in calculating the capital gains incentive fee. Under this  look through  methodology, the
portion of the net settlement payments received by the Company pursuant to the TRS which would have represented net investment income to

the Company had the Company held the loans underlying the TRS directly is treated as net investment income subject to the subordinated incentive fee on income payable to FSIC III Advisor pursuant
to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, rather than as realized capital gains in accordance with GAAP, and any unrealized depreciation on individual loans underlying the TRS further reduces the capital gains incentive fee
payable to FSIC III Advisor with respect to realized gains. See Note 8 for a discussion of the TRS.       Subordinated Income
Incentive Fee : Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC III Advisor may also be entitled to receive a subordinated incentive fee on income. The subordinated incentive fee on income, which is calculated and
payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the Company s  pre-incentive fee net investment income  for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital equal to
1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. For purposes of this fee,  adjusted capital  means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company s common stock (including proceeds from its distribution
reinvestment plan) reduced for amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program. As a result, FSIC III Advisor will not earn this part of the incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s
pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FSIC III Advisor will be entitled to a
 catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375% of adjusted capital, or
9.375% annually. Thereafter, FSIC III Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income.       Offering Costs : Offering costs primarily include, among other things, marketing expenses and printing, legal and due diligence fees and other costs pertaining to the Company s continuous
public offering of shares of its common stock. Historically, the Company has charged offering costs against capital in excess of par value on its consolidated balance sheets. Following recent discussions with the Staff of the Division of Investment
Management of the SEC, the Company has decided to change its accounting treatment of offering costs and defer and amortize such costs to expense over twelve months. The Company evaluated this change in accounting treatment of offering costs,
which it implemented effective January 1, 2016, and determined that it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows (see Note 4).   
   Partial Loan Sales:  The Company follows the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860,  Transfers and
Servicing , or ASC Topic 860, when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. This guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a participating interest, as defined in the guidance,
in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are recorded as a secured
borrowing until the participation or other partial loan sale meets the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value. See Note 8 for additional
information.       Reclassifications : Certain amounts in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 may have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used to prepare the unaudited consolidated financial statements
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. These reclassifications had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as previously reported.

       Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting

   In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest , or ASU 2015-03, to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under pre-existing guidance, debt issuance costs were recognized as a deferred
charge and presented as an asset on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability for indebtedness be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that
liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15,  Interest Imputation of Interest,  or ASU 2015-15, to update the guidance to include SEC staff views regarding the
presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC indicated
that it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any
outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.      Commencing January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and
changed its method of disclosing debt issuance costs for its repurchase agreement and term loan credit facility. ASU 2015-03 affects the presentation and disclosure of such costs in the Company s financial statements. There is no change to the
Company s recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. In accordance with ASU 2015-15, the Company elected to continue to present debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset, unchanged from its prior
method of disclosure.      Comparative financial statements of prior interim and annual periods have been adjusted to apply the
new method retrospectively. The adoption and retrospective adjustment of ASU 2015-03 had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as previously reported.

    Status of Continuous Public Offering    
  Since commencing its continuous public offering and through November 1, 2016, the Company has issued 272,098,970 shares of common
stock for gross proceeds of $2,607,015. As of November 1, 2016, the Company had raised total gross proceeds of $2,619,002, including $200 of seed capital contributed by the principals of FSIC III Advisor in October 2013 and $11,787 in proceeds
raised in a private placement completed in April 2014 from the principals of FSIC III Advisor, certain members of the Company s board of directors and other individuals and entities affiliated with FSIC III Advisor and GSO / Blackstone Debt
Funds Management LLC, or GDFM, the Company s investment sub-adviser (see Note 4).      During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 29,970,095 and 110,978,425 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $251,540 and $1,082,686 at an average price per share of $8.39 and $9.76, respectively. The gross proceeds received during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, include reinvested stockholder distributions of $72,161 and $42,237 for which the Company issued 8,922,378 and 4,760,769 shares of common stock, respectively. During the period from October 1, 2016 to
November 1, 2016, the Company issued 1,517,086 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $12,947 at an average price per share of $8.53.      The proceeds from the issuance of common stock as presented on the Company s consolidated statements of changes in net assets and consolidated statements of cash flows are presented net of selling
commissions and dealer manager fees of $9,992 and $93,827 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      The Company is currently offering shares of its common stock pursuant to its continuous public offering only to persons who purchase through investment advisors whose contracts for investment advisory and
related services include a fixed or  wrap  fee or other asset-based fee arrangement, and who are collectively referred to herein as Advisors, and to certain affiliated investors who purchase through FS Investment Solutions, LLC (formerly
FS   2    Capital Partners, LLC), or FS Investment Solutions,
the dealer manager for the continuous public offering. Sales of shares of the Company s common stock through Advisors is referred to herein as the Institutional Channel. In February 2016, the Company closed its continuous public offering to
investors investing through the IBD Channel, or the IBD Channel closing. As used herein, the IBD Channel refers to sales of shares of the Company s common stock through broker-dealers (other than the dealer manager) that are members of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and other properly licensed financial securities firms whose contracts for investment advisory and related services do not include a fixed or  wrap  fee or other asset-based fee
arrangement, and who are collectively referred to herein as selected broker-dealers. Historically, sales through the IBD Channel have constituted the majority of shares sold in the Company s continuous public offering.   
  Prior to the IBD Channel closing, shares of the Company s common stock in its continuous public offering were subject to a sales
load of up to 10.0% of the public offering price, which consisted of selling commissions and dealer manager fees of up to 7.0% and 3.0%, respectively, of the public offering price. Following the IBD Channel closing, shares of common stock in
its continuous public offering have been sold at an institutional offering price that does not include any selling commissions or dealer manager fees. The institutional offering price as of September 30, 2016 was $8.42 per share; however, to the
extent that the Company s net asset value per share increases, the Company will sell at a price necessary to ensure that shares are not sold at a price per

share that is below the Company s net asset value per share. In the event of a material decline in the Company s net asset value per share, which the Company considers to be a 2.5%
decrease below the Company s then-current net offering price, the Company will reduce its institutional offering price in order to establish a new institutional offering price that is not more than 2.5% above the Company s net asset value
per share.       Share Repurchase Program       The Company intends to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers pursuant to its share repurchase program. The Company s board of directors will consider the following factors, among others, in
making its determination regarding whether to cause the Company to offer to repurchase shares and under what terms:       

the effect of such repurchases on the Company s qualification as a RIC (including the consequences of any necessary asset sales);

the liquidity of the Company s assets (including fees and costs associated with disposing of assets);      

the Company s investment plans and working capital requirements;      

the relative economies of scale with respect to the Company s size;      

the Company s history in repurchasing shares of common stock or portions thereof; and      

the condition of the securities markets.         The Company currently intends to limit the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of shares of common stock it can repurchase with the proceeds it
receives from the issuance of shares of common stock under its distribution reinvestment plan. At the discretion of the Company s board of directors, the Company may also use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings and cash from the
liquidation of securities investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares of common stock. In addition, the Company will limit the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding in the prior calendar year, or 2.5% in each calendar quarter, though the actual number of shares of common stock that the Company offers to repurchase may be less in light of the limitations noted
above. The Company currently intends to offer to repurchase such shares of common stock on each date of repurchase at a price equal to the institutional offering price in effect on the date of repurchase. In months in which the Company repurchases
shares of common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program, it expects to conduct repurchases on the same date that it holds its first weekly closing in such month for the sale of shares of common stock in its continuous public offering. The
Company s board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days  notice.

       Note 3. Share Transactions (continued)
       
   The following table provides information concerning the Company s repurchases of
shares of its common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       
    On October 5, 2016 the Company repurchased 2,030,975 shares of common stock (representing 100% of
the shares of common stock tendered for repurchase and 0.76% of the shares outstanding as of such date) at $8.505 per share for aggregate consideration totaling $17,273.       Note 4. Related Party Transactions        Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer
Manager       Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC III Advisor is entitled to an
annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average weekly value of the Company s gross assets and an incentive fee based on the Company s performance. The Company commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative
services agreement on April 2, 2014, upon commencement of the Company s investment operations. Management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. FSIC III Advisor has agreed, effective in February 2017 (one year following the IBD Channel
closing), to waive a portion of the base management fee so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the Company s average weekly gross assets.      The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0%
of the Company s  pre-incentive fee net investment income  for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, equal to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized
hurdle rate of 7.5%. For purposes of this fee,  adjusted capital  means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company s common stock (including proceeds from its distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for amounts paid
for share repurchases pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program. As a result, FSIC III Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds
the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FSIC III Advisor will be entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net
investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375%, or 9.375% annually, of adjusted capital. This  catch-up  feature allows FSIC III Advisor to
recoup the fees foregone as a result of the existence of the hurdle rate. Thereafter, FSIC III Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income.

   The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on
capital gains, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of the Company s incentive fee capital gains
(i.e., the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less
the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. The Company accrues for the capital gains incentive fee, which, if earned, is paid annually. The Company accrues the capital gains incentive fee based on net realized and
unrealized gains; however, under the terms of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the fee payable to FSIC III Advisor is based on realized gains and no such fee is payable with respect to unrealized gains unless and until
such gains are actually realized. See Note 2 for a discussion of the treatment of the TRS with respect to the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee.      Pursuant to an investment sub-advisory agreement between FSIC III Advisor and GDFM, or the investment sub-advisory agreement, GDFM will receive 50% of all management and incentive fees payable to FSIC III
Advisor under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with respect to each year.      The Company reimburses
FSIC III Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company s administration and operations, including FSIC III Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of Franklin
Square Holdings, L.P., or FS Investments, the Company s sponsor and an affiliate of FSIC III Advisor, providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of FSIC III Advisor. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of
(1) FSIC III Advisor s actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimates it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location.
FSIC III Advisor allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Company s board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining
how the expenses are allocated to the Company and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among the Company and certain affiliates of FSIC III Advisor. The Company s board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such
reimbursements for expenses allocated to the Company based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In
addition, the Company s board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Company s board of directors compares the
total amount paid to FSIC III Advisor for such services as a percentage of the Company s net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. The Company does not reimburse FSIC III Advisor for any services for which it receives a
separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FSIC III Advisor.      Under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the Company, either directly or through reimbursement to FSIC III Advisor or its affiliates, is responsible for its organization and
offering costs in an amount up to 1.5% of gross proceeds raised in the Company s continuous public offering. Organization and offering costs primarily include legal, accounting, printing and other expenses relating to the Company s
continuous public offering, including costs associated with technology integration between the Company s systems and those of its selected broker-dealers, marketing expenses, salaries and direct expenses of FSIC III Advisor s personnel,
employees of its affiliates and others while engaged in registering and marketing the Company s common stock, which includes the development of marketing materials and presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally coordinating
the marketing process for the Company.

   Prior to satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement and for a period of time
thereafter, FS Investments funded certain of the Company s organization and offering costs. Following this period, the Company has paid certain of its organization and offering costs directly and reimbursed FSIC III Advisor for offering costs
incurred by FSIC III Advisor on the Company s behalf, including marketing expenses, salaries and other direct expenses of FSIC III Advisor s personnel and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing the
Company s shares of common stock. Organization and offering costs funded directly by FS Investments were recorded by the Company as a contribution to capital. The offering costs were offset against capital in excess of par value on the
consolidated financial statements and the organization costs were charged to expense as incurred by the Company. All other offering costs, including costs incurred directly by the Company, amounts reimbursed to FSIC III Advisor for ongoing offering
costs and any reimbursements paid to FS Investments for organization and offering costs previously funded, are recorded as a reduction of capital. Commencing January 1, 2016, offering costs incurred by the Company are deferred and amortized to
expense over twelve months (see Note 2).      Since June 7, 2013 (Inception) through December 31, 2014, FS Investments
funded $3,801 in offering and organization costs, all of which were reimbursed during the period from April 2, 2014 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2014. The reimbursements were recorded as a reduction of capital. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FS Investments did not fund any of the Company s offering and organization costs. As of September 30, 2016, no amounts remain reimbursable to FSIC III Advisor and its affiliates under this arrangement.
     The dealer manager for the Company s continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, which is one of the
Company s affiliates. Prior to the IBD Channel closing, the dealer manager was entitled under the dealer manager agreement, dated as of December 20, 2013, by and among the Company, FSIC III Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, or the
dealer manager agreement, to receive selling commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of shares of common stock in the Company s continuous public offering, all or a portion of which could be re-allowed to selected
broker-dealers. Following the IBD Channel closing, the dealer manager has waived its right to receive any selling commissions or dealer manager fees in connection with shares of the Company s common stock sold pursuant to the Company s
continuous public offering and, as a result, no selling commissions or dealer manager fees will be paid to the dealer manager from that date forward.

costs of administrative personnel for services rendered to the Company by FSIC III Advisor and the remainder related to other reimbursable expenses. The Company paid $2,254 and $923 in administrative services expenses to FSIC III Advisor during the

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred offering costs of $1,675 and $3,600, respectively, of which $1,376 and $2,232,
respectively, generally related to the reimbursement of marketing expenses, salaries and direct expenses of FSIC III Advisor s employees and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing the Company s shares of
common stock. See Note 2 for a discussion regarding the Company s change in accounting treatment of offering costs.

dealer manager has waived its right to receive any selling commissions or dealer manager fees in connection with shares of the Company s common stock sold pursuant to the Company s continuous public offering. The fees reflected for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 represent fees retained by FS Investment Solutions prior to the IBD Channel closing in February 2016.         Capital Contributions by FSIC III Advisor and GDFM       In October 2013,
pursuant to a private placement, Michael C. Forman and David J. Adelman, the principals of FSIC III Advisor, contributed an aggregate of $200, which was used in its entirety to purchase 22,222 shares of common stock at $9.00 per share, which
represented the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share,

excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The principals will not tender these shares of common stock for repurchase as long as FSIC III Advisor remains the Company s investment
adviser.      In April 2014, pursuant to a private placement, Messrs. Forman (through an affiliated entity) and Adelman purchased
111,111 additional shares of common stock at $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The principals will not tender these shares of common stock
for repurchase as long as FSIC III Advisor remains the Company s investment adviser. In connection with the same private placement, certain members of the Company s board of directors and other individuals and entities affiliated with FSIC
III Advisor purchased 640,194 shares of common stock, and certain individuals and entities affiliated with GDFM purchased 558,334 shares of common stock, in each case at a price of $9.00 per share, which represented the initial public offering price
of $10.00 per share, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees. In connection with the private placement, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,309,639 shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of $11,787 upon satisfying the minimum
offering requirement on April 2, 2014. As of November 1, 2016, the Company has issued an aggregate of 1,972,122 shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of $17,568 to members of the Company s board of directors and other
individuals and entities affiliated with FSIC III Advisor and GDFM, including shares of common stock sold to Messrs. Forman and Adelman in October 2013 and shares sold in the private placement completed in April 2014.   
   Potential Conflicts of Interest       FSIC III Advisor s senior management team is comprised of substantially the same personnel as the senior management teams of FB Income Advisor, LLC, FS Investment Advisor, LLC, FSIC II Advisor, LLC,
FSIC IV Advisor, LLC and FS Global Advisor, LLC, the investment advisers to certain other BDCs and a closed-end management investment company sponsored by FS Investments. As a result, such personnel provide investment advisory services to the
Company and each of FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation IV and FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund. While none of FSIC III Advisor, FB Income Advisor, LLC, FS Investment
Advisor, LLC, FSIC II Advisor, LLC, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC or FS Global Advisor, LLC is currently making private corporate debt investments for clients other than the Company, FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment
Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation IV or FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund, respectively, any, or all, may do so in the future. In the event that FSIC III Advisor undertakes to provide investment advisory services to other clients in the
future, it intends to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies, if necessary, so that the Company will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other
client of FSIC III Advisor or its management team. In addition, even in the absence of FSIC III Advisor retaining additional clients, it is possible that some investment opportunities may be provided to FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power
Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation IV and/or FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund rather than to the Company.   
   Exemptive Relief       As a
BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the
absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. In an order dated June 4,

2013, the SEC granted exemptive relief to affiliates of the Company, upon which the Company may rely, and which permits the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to
co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of FSIC III Advisor, including FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation IV and any future
BDCs that are advised by FSIC III Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers, or collectively, the Company s co-investment affiliates. The Company believes this relief has and may continue to enhance its ability to further its investment
objectives and strategies. The Company believes this relief may also increase favorable investment opportunities for it, in part, by allowing the Company to participate in larger investments, together with its co-investment affiliates, than would be
available to the Company if such relief had not been obtained. Because the Company s affiliates did not seek exemptive relief to engage in co-investment transactions with GDFM and its affiliates, the Company is permitted to co-invest with GDFM
and its affiliates only in accordance with existing regulatory guidance (e.g. where price is the only negotiated term).       Expense
Reimbursement       Pursuant to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement, dated as of December 20, 2013, by
and between FS Investments and the Company, or the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of the Company s distributions to
stockholders will be paid from its offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments the Company may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other distributions to the Company that are
treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, a portion of the Company s distributions to stockholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital to the extent that the Company may use such dividends or other distribution proceeds
to fund its distributions to stockholders. Under those circumstances, FS Investments will not reimburse the Company for the portion of such distributions to stockholders that represent a return of capital, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement
arrangement is not to prevent tax-advantaged distributions to stockholders.      Under the expense reimbursement agreement, FS
Investments will reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount equal to the difference between the Company s cumulative distributions paid to its stockholders in each quarter, less the sum of the Company s net investment company taxable
income, net capital gains and dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts are not included in net investment company taxable income or
net capital gains) in each quarter.      Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, the Company has a conditional obligation
to reimburse FS Investments for any amounts funded by FS Investments under such agreement if (and only to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which FS Investments funded such amount, the sum of the
Company s net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not
included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds the regular cash distributions paid by the Company to its stockholders; provided, however, that (i) the Company will only reimburse FS Investments for expense support
payments made by FS Investments with respect to any calendar quarter to the extent that the payment of such reimbursement (together with any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause  other operating expenses  (as
defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of any expense support payments received by the Company during such fiscal year) to

exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of the Company s average net assets attributable to shares of its common stock for the fiscal year-to-date period after taking such payments into account and
(B) the percentage of the Company s average net assets attributable to shares of its common stock represented by  other operating expenses  during the fiscal year in which such expense support payment from FS Investments was made
(provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment which relates to an expense support payment from FS Investments made during the same fiscal year) and (ii) the Company will not reimburse FS Investments for
expense support payments made by FS Investments for any calendar quarter if the annualized rate of regular cash distributions declared by the Company at the time of such reimbursement payment is less than the annualized rate of regular cash
distributions declared by the Company at the time FS Investments made the expense support payment to which such reimbursement payment relates. The Company is not obligated to pay interest on the reimbursements it is required to make to FS
Investments under the expense reimbursement agreement.  Other operating expenses  means the Company s total  operating expenses  (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, offering and organization
expenses, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses.  Operating expenses  means all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with GAAP for investment companies.
     The Company or FS Investments may terminate the expense reimbursement agreement at any time. FS Investments has indicated
that it expects to continue such reimbursements until it deems that the Company has achieved economies of scale sufficient to ensure that it bears a reasonable level of expenses in relation to its income. The specific amount of expenses reimbursed
by FS Investments, if any, will be determined at the end of each quarter. Upon termination of the expense reimbursement agreement by FS Investments, FS Investments will be required to fund any amounts accrued thereunder as of the date of
termination. Similarly, the Company s conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments pursuant to the terms of the expense reimbursement agreement shall survive the termination of such agreement by either party.   
  As of December 31, 2015, there were no reimbursements payable to the Company from FS Investments. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company did not accrue any amounts for expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not receive any cash reimbursements from FS Investments. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had no reimbursements due from FS Investments.      As discussed above, under the expense
reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to the Company by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by the Company in the future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid $218 in expense recoupments to FS
Investments. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have expense recoupments due to FS Investments and no further amounts remain subject to repayment by the Company to FS Investments in the future.   
  FS Investments is controlled by the Company s chairman, president and chief executive officer, Michael C. Forman, and its
vice-chairman, David J. Adelman. There can be no assurance that the expense reimbursement agreement will remain in effect or that FS Investments will reimburse any portion of the Company s expenses in future quarters.

    FS Benefit Trust       FS Benefit Trust, or FS Trust, was formed as a Delaware statutory trust for the purpose of awarding equity incentive compensation to employees of FS Investments and its affiliates. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, FS Trust purchased $203 of the Company s shares at a purchase price of $8.10 per share, which price is equal to the institutional offering price in effect on the date of purchase. During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, FS Trust purchased $231 of the Company s shares of common stock at a purchase price of $8.96 per share, which price is equal to 90% of the offering price in effect on the purchase date.   
   Note 5. Distributions    
  The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that the Company declared and paid on its common stock during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       
    The Company currently declares regular cash distributions on a quarterly basis and pays such
distributions on a monthly basis to stockholders of record, as determined on a weekly basis. On August 4, 2016 and November 4, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared regular weekly cash distributions for October 2016 through
December 2016 and January 2017 through March 2017, respectively, each in the amount of $0.013461 per share. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to stockholders of record as of weekly record dates previously determined by the
Company s board of directors. The timing and amount of any future distributions to stockholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company s board of directors.   
  The Company has adopted an  opt in  distribution reinvestment plan for its stockholders. As a result, if the Company makes a
cash distribution, its stockholders will receive the distribution in cash unless they specifically  opt in  to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company s
common stock. However, certain state authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a stockholder s ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan.   
  Under the distribution reinvestment plan, cash distributions to participating stockholders are reinvested in additional shares of the
Company s common stock at a purchase price equal to the institutional offering price in effect on the date of issuance. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal,
state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders who elect to participate in the Company s distribution reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash

distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. Stockholders receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the
amount of the fair market value of the Company s shares of common stock.      The Company may fund its cash distributions to
stockholders from any sources of funds legally available to it, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets and
dividends or other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense reimbursements from FS Investments. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may
use from available sources to make distributions. During certain periods, the Company s distributions may exceed its earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions the Company makes may represent a return of capital.
A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection
with the Company s continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FSIC III Advisor. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on
the sale of securities, and/or a return of capital, which is a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to the Company s stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all.
     For a period of time following commencement of the Company s continuous public offering, which time period may be
significant, substantial portions of the Company s distributions have been, and may in the future, be funded through the reimbursement of certain expenses by FS Investments and its affiliates, including through the waiver of certain investment
advisory fees by FSIC III Advisor, that are subject to repayment by the Company within three years. The purpose of this arrangement is to ensure that no portion of the Company s distributions to stockholders will be paid from offering proceeds
or borrowings. Any such distributions funded through expense reimbursements or waivers of advisory fees are not based on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in
future periods and/or FS Investments continues to make such reimbursements or waivers of such fees. The Company s future repayments of amounts reimbursed or waived by FS Investments or its affiliates will reduce the distributions that
stockholders would otherwise receive in the future. FS Investments and its affiliates have no obligation to waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods. No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was funded through the reimbursement of operating expenses by FS Investments.

   The following table reflects the sources of the cash distributions on a tax basis that
the Company has paid on its common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       

(1)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 92.2% and 94.3%, respectively, of the Company s gross investment income was attributable to cash income
earned, 2.7% and 5.0%, respectively, was attributable to non-cash accretion of discount and 5.1% and 0.7%, respectively, was attributable to paid-in-kind, or PIK, interest.     
  The Company s net investment income on a tax basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $136,892 and $79,307,
respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $11,029 and $10,089, respectively, of undistributed net investment income and $54,394 and $24,134, respectively, of accumulated capital losses on a tax basis.   
  The difference between the Company s GAAP-basis net investment income and its tax-basis net investment income is primarily due to
the reclassification of unamortized original issue discount and prepayment fees recognized upon prepayment of loans from income for GAAP purposes to realized gains for tax purposes, the inclusion of a portion of the periodic net settlement payments
due on the Company s TRS in tax-basis net investment income and the accretion of discount on the TRS.      The following
table sets forth a reconciliation between GAAP-basis net investment income and tax-basis net investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

   The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions is made
annually as of the end of the Company s fiscal year based upon the Company s taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the
actual tax attributes of the Company s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis were as follows:   

(1)  
  Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, net capital losses recognized for tax years beginning after December 22, 2010, may be carried forward
indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term or long-term losses. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had short-term and long-term capital loss carryforwards available to offset future realized capital gains of $0 and $54,394,
respectively.         
 
  The aggregate cost of the Company s investments and secured borrowing, including the accretion of discount on the TRS, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes totaled $3,204,562 and $2,938,163 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The aggregate net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on a tax basis, including the Company s TRS, was $(30,270)
and $(219,460) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Company would be presumed to  control  a portfolio company if it owned more than 25% of its voting securities or it had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of
such portfolio company, and would be an  affiliated person  of a portfolio company if it owned 5% or more of its voting securities.      The Company s investment portfolio may contain loans and other unfunded arrangements that are in the form of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, delayed draw credit facilities or other
investments, pursuant to which the Company may be required to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had twenty-one unfunded debt
investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $192,653. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had twenty-one unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $267,776 and two unfunded commitments to purchase up to $467 and
$369, respectively, in shares of preferred stock of Altus Power America Holdings, LLC and common equity of Sunnova Holdings, LLC. The Company maintains sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded
commitments should the need arise. For additional details regarding the Company s unfunded debt investments, see the Company s unaudited consolidated schedule of investments as of September 30, 2016 and audited consolidated schedule of
investments as of December 31, 2015.      The table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the

    Note 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
  Under existing accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. This accounting guidance emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are
inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.   
  The Company classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy as defined by current accounting
guidance:       Level 1 : Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
      Level 2 : Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.   
   Level 3 : Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability.   
  A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s investments and total
return swap were categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy:       
    The Company has elected the fair value option under ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments , or ASC
Topic 825, relating to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value for its secured borrowing which arose due to partial loan sales which did not meet the criteria for sale treatment under ASC Topic 860. The Company reports changes in the
fair value of its secured borrowing as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on secured borrowing in the consolidated statements of operations. The net gain or loss reflects the difference between the fair value and
the principal amount due on maturity.      The secured borrowing as of September 30, 2016 was valued using Level 3 inputs
under the fair value hierarchy. The Company s approach to determining fair value of the Level 3 secured borrowing is consistent with its approach to determining fair value of the Level 3 investments that are associated with the secured
borrowing. See Note 2 and Note 8 for additional information.

       Note 7. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments (continued)        
   As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s secured
borrowing was categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy:       
    The Company s investments as of September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that were
acquired directly from the issuer. Forty-eight senior secured loan investments, two senior secured bond investments and eleven subordinated debt investments, for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by independent valuation firms,
which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features, anticipated
prepayments and other relevant terms of the investments. Except as described below, all of the Company s equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by
considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or,
in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. Two equity/other investments, which were traded on an active public market, were valued at their closing price as of September 30, 2016. Except as described above, the Company valued its other
investments, including three equity/other investments, by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for
validity by such services.      The Company s investments as of December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of debt
investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Forty senior secured loan investments, two senior secured bond investments and seven subordinated debt investments, for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by independent
valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features,
anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the investments. All of the Company s equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other
factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. Two senior secured loan investments,
which were newly issued and purchased near December 31, 2015, were valued at cost, as the Company s board of directors determined that the cost of each such investment was the best indication of its fair value. Except as described above,
the Company valued its other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by
such services.      The Company values the TRS in accordance with the agreements between Center City Funding and Citibank that
collectively established the TRS, which agreements are collectively referred to herein as the TRS agreement. Pursuant to the TRS agreement, the value of the TRS is based on the increase or decrease in the value

of the loans underlying the TRS, together with accrued interest income, interest expense and certain other expenses incurred under the TRS. The loans underlying the TRS are valued by Citibank.
Citibank bases its valuation on the indicative bid prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that market participants may be willing to pay. These valuations are sent to the Company for
review and testing. The valuation committee of the Company s board of directors, or the valuation committee, and the board of directors review and approve the value of the TRS, as well as the value of the loans underlying the TRS, on a
quarterly basis as part of their quarterly determination of net asset value. To the extent the Company s valuation committee or board of directors has any questions or concerns regarding the valuation of the loans underlying the TRS, such
valuation is discussed or challenged pursuant to the terms of the TRS agreement. For additional information on the Company s TRS, see Note 8.      The Company periodically benchmarks the bid and ask prices it receives from the third-party pricing services and/or dealers, as applicable, against the actual prices at which the Company purchases and
sells its investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of the Company s management in purchasing and selling these investments, the Company believes that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value.
However, because of the private nature of this marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), the Company believes that these valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company may also use
other methods, including the use of an independent valuation firm, to determine fair value for securities for which it cannot obtain prevailing bid and ask prices through third-party pricing services or independent dealers, or where the
Company s board of directors otherwise determines that the use of such other methods is appropriate. The Company periodically benchmarks the valuations provided by the independent valuation firms against the actual prices at which the Company
purchases and sells its investments. The valuation committee of the Company s board of directors and the board of directors reviewed and approved the valuation determinations made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with
the Company s valuation policy.

period end, which were provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services. For investments utilizing a market comparables valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the market yield, in
isolation, would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in any of the valuation multiples, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. For
investments utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. For investments utilizing an option
valuation model valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the volatility, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

   Citibank Total Return Swap       On June 26, 2014, the Company s wholly-owned financing subsidiary, Center City Funding, entered into a TRS for a portfolio of primarily senior secured floating rate loans with Citibank, which
has subsequently been amended multiple times to, among other things, increase the maximum aggregate notional amount of the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS from $100,000, initially, to $500,000. Most recently, on June 27, 2016, Center City
Funding entered into a sixth amendment to the TRS to, among other things, (x) extend the date that Citibank may terminate the TRS from any time on or after June 26, 2016 to any time on or after June 27, 2017 and (y) increase the
swap spread over one-month LIBOR Center City Funding pays to Citibank on the utilized notional amount under the TRS from 1.50% per annum to 1.55% per annum.

       Note 8. Financing
Arrangements (continued)        
   A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to another party
based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or securities indices during a specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable
interest rate. A TRS effectively adds leverage to a portfolio by providing investment exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or investing directly in such market. Because of the unique structure
of a TRS, a TRS often offers lower financing costs than are offered through more traditional borrowing arrangements.      The TRS
with Citibank enables the Company, through its ownership of Center City Funding, to obtain the economic benefit of owning the loans subject to the TRS, without actually owning them, in return for an
 interest-type  payment to Citibank. As such, the TRS is analogous to Center City Funding borrowing funds to acquire loans and incurring interest expense to a lender.   
  The obligations of Center City Funding under the TRS are non-recourse to the Company and its exposure under the TRS is limited to the
value of the Company s investment in Center City Funding, which generally will equal the value of cash collateral provided by Center City Funding under the TRS. Pursuant to the terms of the TRS, Center City Funding may select a portfolio of
loans with a maximum aggregate notional amount (determined at the time each such loan becomes subject to the TRS) of $500,000. Center City Funding is required to initially cash collateralize a specified percentage of the notional amount of each loan
(generally 20%) that becomes subject to the TRS in accordance with margin requirements described in the TRS agreement. Under the terms of the TRS, Center City Funding has agreed not to draw upon, or post as collateral, such cash collateral in
respect of other financings or operating requirements prior to the termination of the TRS. Neither the cash collateral required to be posted with Citibank nor any other assets of Center City Funding are available to pay the Company s debts.
     Pursuant to the terms of an investment management agreement that the Company has entered into with Center City Funding, the
Company acts as the investment manager of the rights and obligations of Center City Funding under the TRS, including selecting the specific loans to be included in the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS. Accordingly, the loans subject to the TRS
are selected by the Company in accordance with the Company s investment objectives and strategy to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the TRS, Center City
Funding may select any loan or obligation available in the market to be included in the portfolio of loans that meets the obligation criteria set forth in the TRS agreement.      Each individual loan, and the portfolio of loans taken as a whole, must meet criteria described in the TRS agreement, including a requirement that substantially all of the loans underlying the TRS be
rated by Moody s Investors Service, Inc., or Moody s, and Standard   Poor s Ratings Services, or S P, and quoted by a nationally recognized pricing service. Under the terms of the TRS, Citibank, as calculation agent,
determines whether there has been a failure to satisfy the portfolio criteria in the TRS. If such failure continues for 30 days following the delivery of notice thereof, then Citibank has the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the TRS.
Center City Funding receives from Citibank all interest and fees payable in respect of the loans included in the portfolio. Center City Funding pays to Citibank interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.55% per annum on the utilized
notional amount of the loans subject to the TRS. In addition, upon the termination or repayment of any loan subject to the TRS, Center City Funding will either receive from Citibank the appreciation in the value of such loan or pay to Citibank any
depreciation in the value of such loan.

       Note 8. Financing
Arrangements (continued)        
   Under the terms of the TRS, Center City Funding may be required to post additional cash
collateral, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, in the event of depreciation in the value of the underlying loans after such value decreases below a specified amount. The limit on the additional collateral that Center City Funding may be required to post
pursuant to the TRS is equal to the difference between the full notional amount of the loans underlying the TRS and the amount of cash collateral already posted by Center City Funding. The amount of collateral required to be posted by Center City
Funding is determined primarily on the basis of the aggregate value of the underlying loans.      The Company has no contractual
obligation to post any such additional collateral or to make any interest payments to Citibank. The Company may, but is not obligated to, increase its equity investment in Center City Funding for the purpose of funding any additional collateral or
payment obligations for which Center City Funding may become obligated during the term of the TRS. If the Company does not make any such additional investment in Center City Funding and Center City Funding fails to meet its obligations under the
TRS, then Citibank will have the right to terminate the TRS and seize the cash collateral posted by Center City Funding under the TRS. In the event of an early termination of the TRS, Center City Funding would be required to pay an early termination
fee.      Citibank may terminate the TRS from any time on or after June 27, 2017. Center City Funding may terminate the TRS
at any time upon providing no more than 30 days, and no less than 10 days, prior notice to Citibank. Any termination prior to June 27, 2017, will result in payment of an early termination fee to Citibank based on the maximum notional amount of
the TRS. Under the terms of the TRS, the early termination fee will equal the present value of a stream of monthly payments, based on the minimum utilization amount, which would be owed by Center City Funding to Citibank for the period from the
termination date through and including June 27, 2017. Such monthly payments will equal the present value of the product of (x) 80%, multiplied by (y) the maximum notional amount of the TRS ($500,000), multiplied by
(z) 1.55% per annum. If the TRS had been terminated as of September 30, 2016, Center City Funding would have been required to pay an early termination fee of approximately $4,054, based on the maximum notional amount of the TRS of $500,000
as of such date. Other than during the first 90 days and last 30 days of the term of the TRS, Center City Funding is required to pay a minimum usage fee if less than 80% of the maximum notional amount of the TRS is utilized and an unused fee on any
amounts unutilized if greater than 80% but less than 100% of the maximum notional amount of the TRS is utilized.      The value of
the TRS is based primarily on the valuation of the underlying portfolio of loans subject to the TRS. Pursuant to the terms of the TRS, on each business day, Citibank values each underlying loan in good faith on a mark-to-market basis by determining
how much Citibank would receive on such date if it sold the loan in the open market. Citibank reports the mark-to-market values of the underlying loans to Center City Funding.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the TRS was $5,103 and $(25,927), respectively. The net change in fair value of the TRS is reflected as unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on total return swap on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The change in value of the TRS is reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
total return swap. As of September 30, 2016, Center City Funding had selected 59 underlying loans with a total notional amount of $458,785 and posted $116,000 in cash collateral held by Citibank (of which only $110,220 was required to be posted),
which is reflected in due from counterparty on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, Center City Funding had selected 51 underlying loans with a total notional amount of

$394,680 and posted $118,000 in cash collateral held by Citibank (of which only $91,174 was required to be posted), which is reflected in due from counterparty on the consolidated balance sheets.
     For purposes of the asset coverage ratio test applicable to the Company as a BDC, the Company treats the outstanding notional
amount of the TRS, less the initial amount of any cash collateral required to be posted by Center City Funding under the TRS, as a senior security for the life of that instrument. The Company may, however, accord different treatment to the TRS in
the future in accordance with any applicable new rules or interpretations adopted by the staff of the SEC.      Further, for
purposes of Section 55(a) under the 1940 Act, the Company treats each loan underlying the TRS as a qualifying asset if the obligor on such loan is an eligible portfolio company and as a non-qualifying asset if the obligor is not an eligible
portfolio company. The Company may, however, accord different treatment to the TRS in the future in accordance with any applicable new rules or interpretations adopted by the staff of the SEC.

with BNPP, on behalf of itself and as agent for BNP Paribas, BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage International, Ltd. and BNPP PB, Inc., or, collectively, the BNPP Entities. The BNP facility was effected
through a committed facility agreement by and between Burholme Funding and BNPP, or the committed facility agreement, a U.S. PB agreement by and between Burholme Funding and BNPP, and a special custody and pledge agreement by and among Burholme
Funding, BNPP and State Street Bank and Trust Company, or State Street, as custodian, each dated as of October 17, 2014, and which are collectively referred to herein as the BNP financing agreements. On March 11, 2015, Burholme Funding
entered into an amendment to the BNP facility to increase the maximum commitment financing available to Burholme Funding under the BNP facility from $100,000 to $200,000. On August 29, 2016, Burholme Funding entered into an amendment to the BNP
facility to, among other things, (i) increase the interest rate payable on borrowings under the committed facility agreement from three-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points to three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points effective on and after January 2,
2017 and (ii) increase the commitment fee payable under the committed facility agreement from 55 basis points on all unused amounts to, effective on and after January 2, 2017, (a) 65 basis points on unused amounts so long as 75% or more of the
facility amount under the committed facility agreement is utilized or (b) 85 basis points on unused amounts if less than 75% of the facility amount under the committed facility agreement is utilized.   
  The Company may contribute securities to Burholme Funding from time to time, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the committed
facility agreement, and will retain a residual interest in any securities contributed through its ownership of Burholme Funding or will receive fair market value for any securities sold to Burholme Funding. Burholme Funding may purchase additional
securities from various sources. Burholme Funding has appointed the Company to manage its portfolio of securities pursuant to the terms of an investment management agreement. Burholme Funding s obligations to BNPP under the BNP facility are
secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Burholme Funding, including its portfolio of securities. Such pledged portfolio of securities is held in a segregated custody account with State Street. The value of

   Under the terms of the BNP financing agreements, BNPP has the ability to borrow a
portion of the pledged collateral, or collectively, the rehypothecated securities, subject to certain limits. Burholme Funding will receive a fee from BNPP in connection with any rehypothecated securities. Burholme Funding may designate any security
within the pledged collateral as ineligible to be a rehypothecated security, provided there are eligible securities within the segregated custody account in an amount equal to the outstanding borrowings owed by Burholme Funding to BNPP. Burholme
Funding may recall any rehypothecated security at any time, and BNPP must return such security or equivalent security within a commercially reasonable period. In the event BNPP does not return the security, Burholme Funding will have the right to,
among other things, apply and set off an amount equal to 100% of the then-current fair market value of such unreturned rehypothecated security against any outstanding borrowings owed to BNPP under the BNP financing agreements. Rehypothecated
securities are marked-to-market daily and if the value of all rehypothecated securities exceeds 100% of the outstanding borrowings owed by Burholme Funding under the BNP financing agreements, BNPP may either reduce the amount of rehypothecated
securities to eliminate such excess or deposit into the segregated custody account an amount of cash equal to such excess. Burholme Funding will continue to receive interest and the scheduled repayment of principal balances on rehypothecated
securities.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $137,700 and $155,755, respectively, was outstanding under the

exposure under the Deutsche Bank credit facility is limited to the value of its investment in Dunlap Funding.      Pricing under
the Deutsche Bank credit facility is based on LIBOR for a three-month interest period (for each committed lender) or the commercial paper rate of each conduit lender, plus, in each case, a spread of 2.25% per annum. Interest is payable
quarterly in arrears. Dunlap Funding will be subject to a non-usage fee of 0.50% per annum to the extent the aggregate principal amount available under the Deutsche Bank credit facility has not been borrowed. In addition, Dunlap Funding is subject
to (i) a make-whole fee on a quarterly basis effectively equal to a portion of the spread that would have been payable if the full amount under the Deutsche Bank credit facility had been borrowed, less the non-usage fee accrued during such quarter
and (ii) an administration fee. Any amounts borrowed under the Deutsche Bank credit facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable on September 22, 2019. Dunlap Funding paid a structuring fee and
incurred certain other customary costs and expenses in connection with obtaining the Deutsche Bank credit facility.      As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $208,000 and $250,000, respectively, was outstanding under the Deutsche Bank credit facility. The carrying amount outstanding under the Deutsche Bank credit facility approximates its fair value. The Company
incurred costs of $2,938 in connection with obtaining the facility, which the Company has recorded as deferred financing costs on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and amortizes to interest expense over the life of the facility. As of
September 30, 2016, $1,767 of such deferred financing costs had yet to be amortized to interest expense.

   Borrowings of Jefferson Square Funding will be considered borrowings of the Company for
purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act.       Goldman Facility    
  On June 18, 2015, the Company, through its two wholly-owned, special-purpose financing subsidiaries, Germantown Funding and Society Hill
Funding, entered into a debt financing arrangement with Goldman pursuant to which up to $300,000 is available to the Company. The Company elected to structure the financing in the manner described more fully below in order to, among other things,
obtain such financing at a lower cost than would be available through alternative arrangements.      The Company may sell and/or
contribute assets to Germantown Funding from time to time pursuant to an amended and restated sale and contribution agreement, dated as of June 18, 2015, between the Company and Germantown Funding, or the sale and contribution agreement. The assets
held by Germantown Funding secure the obligations of Germantown Funding under floating rate notes, or the notes issued from time to time by Germantown Funding to Society Hill Funding pursuant to an indenture, dated as of June 18, 2015, with
Citibank, as trustee, or the indenture. Pursuant to the indenture, the aggregate principal amount of notes that may be issued by Germantown Funding from time to time is $500,000. Society Hill Funding has purchased the notes issued by Germantown
Funding from time to time at a purchase price equal to their par value.      Interest on the notes under the indenture will accrue
at three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.00% per annum. Principal and any unpaid interest on the notes will be due and payable on the stated maturity date of October 15, 2027.      Society Hill Funding, in turn, has entered into a repurchase transaction with Goldman, pursuant to the terms of a master repurchase agreement and the related annex and master confirmation thereto, each
dated as of June 18, 2015 and effective as of July 15, 2015, or collectively, the Goldman facility. Pursuant to the Goldman facility, from time to time, Goldman has purchased notes held by Society Hill Funding for an aggregate purchase price
equal to 60% of the principal amount of notes purchased. Subject to certain conditions, the maximum principal amount of notes that may be purchased under the Goldman facility is $500,000. Accordingly, the aggregate maximum amount made available
under the Goldman facility will not exceed $300,000.      Society Hill Funding will repurchase the notes sold to Goldman under the
Goldman facility no later than July 15, 2019. The repurchase price paid by Society Hill Funding to Goldman will be equal to the purchase price paid by Goldman for the repurchased notes, plus financing fees accrued at the applicable pricing rate
under the Goldman facility. Up until November 15, 2015, financing fees were accrued on the aggregate purchase price paid by Goldman for such notes. Thereafter, financing fees have accrued, and will continue to accrue, on $300,000 (even if the
aggregate purchase price paid for notes purchased by Goldman at that time is less than that amount), unless and until the outstanding amount is reduced in accordance with the terms of the Goldman facility. If the Goldman facility is accelerated
prior to July 15, 2019 due to an event of default or the failure of Germantown Funding to commit to sell any underlying assets that become defaulted obligations within 30 days, then Society Hill Funding must pay to Goldman a fee equal to the present
value of the aggregate amount of the financing fees that would have been payable to Goldman from the date of acceleration through July 15, 2019 had the acceleration not occurred. The financing fee under the Goldman facility is equal to three-month
LIBOR plus a spread of up to 2.50% per annum for the relevant period.

Arrangements (continued)        
   Goldman may require Society Hill Funding to post cash collateral if the market value of
the notes (measured by reference to the market value of Germantown Funding s portfolio of assets), together with any posted cash collateral, is less than the required margin amount under the Goldman facility; provided, however, that Society
Hill Funding will not be required to post cash collateral with Goldman until such market value has declined at least 10% from the initial market value of the notes. In addition, if the market value of any underlying asset held in Germantown
Funding s portfolio of assets is less than 70% of the initial market value of such underlying asset, Goldman may require Society Hill Funding to post additional cash collateral in an amount equal to 15% of the outstanding principal balance of
such underlying asset. In each such event, in order to satisfy these requirements, Society Hill Funding intends to borrow funds from the Company pursuant to an uncommitted revolving credit agreement, dated as of June 18, 2015, between Society Hill
Funding, as borrower, and the Company, as lender, or the revolving credit agreement. The Company may, in its sole discretion, make such loans from time to time to Society Hill Funding pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit agreement.
Borrowings under the revolving credit agreement may not exceed $300,000 and will accrue interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.75% per annum.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 and $482,000, respectively, had been purchased by Society Hill Funding from Germantown Funding and
subsequently sold to Goldman under the Goldman facility for aggregate proceeds of $300,000 and $289,200, respectively. The carrying amount outstanding under the Goldman facility approximates its fair value. The Company funded each purchase of the
notes by Society Hill Funding through a capital contribution to Society Hill Funding. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Society Hill Funding s liability under the Goldman facility was $300,000 and $289,200, respectively, plus
$2,066 and $1,714, respectively, of accrued interest expense. The notes issued by Germantown Funding and purchased by Society Hill Funding eliminate in consolidation on the Company s financial statements.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of assets held by Germantown Funding was $576,712 and $570,514,
respectively.      The Company incurred costs of $1,590 in connection with obtaining the Goldman facility, which the Company has
recorded as deferred financing costs on its consolidated balance sheets and amortizes to interest expense over the life of the Goldman facility. As of September 30, 2016, $1,109 of such deferred financing costs had yet to be amortized to interest
expense.      For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of total interest expense for the
Goldman facility were as follows:

wholly-owned, special purpose financing subsidiary, Chestnut Hill Funding, entered into a revolving credit facility, or the Capital One credit facility, with Capital One, National Association, or Capital One, as administrative agent, hedge
counterparty, lead arranger and sole bookrunner, each of the conduit lenders and institutional lenders from time to time party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as collateral agent, account bank and collateral custodian under the

receive fair market value for any assets sold to Chestnut Hill Funding. Chestnut Hill Funding may purchase additional assets from various sources. Chestnut Hill Funding has appointed the Company to manage its portfolio of assets pursuant to the
terms of a collateral management agreement. Chestnut Hill Funding s obligations to Capital One under the Capital One credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Chestnut Hill Funding,
including its portfolio of assets. The obligations of Chestnut Hill Funding under the Capital One credit facility are non-recourse to the Company, and the Company s exposure under the Capital One credit facility is limited to the value of the
Company s investment in Chestnut Hill Funding.      Borrowings under the Capital One credit facility accrue interest at a
rate equal to LIBOR for each one-month,  two-month  or three-month interest period, as elected by Chestnut Hill Funding, in each case plus an applicable spread ranging between 1.75% and 2.50% per annum,
depending on the composition of the portfolio of assets for the relevant period. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Chestnut Hill Funding is subject to (a) a non-usage fee to the extent it has not borrowed the aggregate principal amount
available under the Capital One credit facility and (b) beginning February 13, 2016, a make-whole fee to the extent it has borrowed less than 60% of the aggregate principal amount available under the Capital One credit facility. Any amounts borrowed
under the Capital One credit facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on August 13, 2020.

   As of September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a secured borrowing at fair value of
$13,954 and the fair value of the loan that is associated with the secured borrowing was $72,666. The secured borrowing was the result of the Company s completion of a partial sale of a senior secured loan associated with one portfolio company
that did not meet the definition of a participating interest. As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and the partial loan sale was treated as a secured borrowing.

  The per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the applicable period.     

(3)  
  The per share data for distributions reflects the actual amount of distributions paid per share during the applicable period.     

(4)  
  The issuance of common stock on a per share basis reflects the incremental net asset value changes as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock in the
Company s continuous public offering and pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. The issuance of common stock at an offering price, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is greater than the net asset
value per share results in an increase in net asset value per share.         

(5)  
  The per share impact of the Company s repurchases of common stock to net asset value is less than $0.01 per share during each period.     

(6)  
  The total return for each period presented was calculated based on the change in net asset value during the applicable period, including the impact of distributions
reinvested in accordance with the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. The total return does not consider the effect of any selling commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of the Company s
common stock. The total return includes the effect of the issuance of shares at a net offering price that is greater than net asset value per share, which causes an increase in net asset value per share. The historical calculation of total return in
the table should not be considered a representation of the Company s future total return, which may be greater or less than the return shown in the table due to a number of factors, including the Company s ability or inability to make
investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of the Company s expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized
gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in
future periods. The total return calculations set forth above represent the total return on the Company s investment portfolio during the applicable period and do not represent an actual return to stockholders. The total return for the year
ended December 31, 2015 is unaudited.         

(7)  
  The total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) for each period presented was calculated by taking the net asset value per share as of the end of the
applicable period, adding the cash distributions per share which were declared during the applicable period and dividing the total by the net asset value per share at the beginning of the applicable period. The total return (without assuming
reinvestment of distributions) does not consider the effect of any selling commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of the Company s common stock. The total return (without assuming reinvestment of
distributions) includes the effect of the issuance of shares at a net offering price that is greater than net asset value per share, which causes an increase in net asset value per share. The historical calculation of total return (without assuming
reinvestment of distributions) in the table should not be considered a representation of the Company s future total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) which may be greater or less than the return shown in the table due to a
number of factors, including the Company s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of the Company s
expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for
any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. The total return calculations set forth above represent the total return on the Company s investment portfolio during the applicable period and
do not represent an actual return to stockholders.

  Weighted average net assets during the applicable period are used for this calculation. The following is a schedule of supplemental ratios for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015:         

(10)  
  Asset coverage per unit is the ratio of the carrying value of the Company s total consolidated assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior
securities, to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness.

$2,500 from sales of shares of our common stock in our continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with us or FSIC III Advisor. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has
elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement,
we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization.      Our investment activities are managed by FSIC III
Advisor and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. Under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we have agreed to pay FSIC III Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average
weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. FSIC III Advisor has engaged GDFM to act as our investment sub-adviser. GDFM assists FSIC III Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment
recommendations for approval by FSIC III Advisor according to guidelines set by FSIC III Advisor.      Our investment objectives
are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We have identified and intend to focus on the following investment categories, which we believe will allow us to generate an attractive total return with an
acceptable level of risk.       Direct Originations : We intend to leverage our relationship with GDFM and its global
sourcing and origination platform, including its industry relationships, to directly source investment opportunities. Such investments are originated or structured for us or made by us and are not generally available to the broader market. These
investments may include both debt and equity components, although we do not generally make equity investments independent of having an existing credit relationship. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more
favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.       Opportunistic : We intend to seek to capitalize on market
price inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds and other securities where the market price of such investment reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by our fundamental analysis. We believe that market price inefficiencies may occur due to,
among other things, general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an industry being out of favor with the broader investment community. We seek to allocate capital to these securities that have been
misunderstood or mispriced by the market and where we believe there is an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. Such opportunities may include event driven investments, anchor orders and CLOs.   
         69   

Table of Contents  

   In the case of event driven investments, we intend to take advantage of dislocations that
arise in the markets due to an impending event and where the market s apparent expectation of value differs substantially from our fundamental analysis. Such events may include a looming debt maturity or default, a merger, spin-off or other
corporate reorganization, an adverse regulatory or legal ruling, or a material contract expiration, any of which may significantly improve or impair a company s financial position. Compared to other investment strategies, event driven investing
depends more heavily on our ability to successfully predict the outcome of an individual event rather than on underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, successful event driven strategies may offer both substantial diversification benefits
and the ability to generate performance in uncertain market environments.      We may also invest in certain opportunities that
are originated and then syndicated by a commercial or investment bank, but where we provide a capital commitment significantly above the average syndicate participant, i.e., an anchor order. In these types of investments, we may receive fees,
preferential pricing or other benefits not available to other lenders in return for our significant capital commitment. Our decision to provide an anchor order to a syndicated transaction is predicated on a rigorous credit analysis, our familiarity
with a particular company, industry or financial sponsor, and the broader investment experiences of FSIC III Advisor and GDFM.   
  In addition, our relationship with GSO Capital Partners LP, the parent of GDFM, and one of the largest CLO managers in the world, allows
us to opportunistically invest in CLOs. CLOs are a form of securitization where the cash flow from a pooled basket of syndicated loans is used to support distribution payments made to different tranches of securities. While collectively CLOs
represent nearly fifty percent of the broadly syndicated loan universe, investing in individual CLO tranches requires a high degree of investor sophistication due to their structural complexity and the illiquid nature of their securities.
      Broadly Syndicated/Other : Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions and
opportunistic investments, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a
complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we typically receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio
in such a way that maximizes the levered return potential of our portfolio.      Our portfolio is comprised primarily of
investments in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle market U.S. companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be
comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market
transactions in the  over-the-counter  market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants
or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in target companies, in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into
or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity. Any such minority interests are generally acquired in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor,
such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. FSIC III
Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments.
     The senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we invest generally have stated terms
of three to seven years and subordinated debt investments that we make generally have stated   
         70   

Table of Contents  

terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and seven years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security in
our portfolio. Our debt investments may be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than  Baa3  by Moody s or lower than
 BBB-  by S P). We also invest in non-rated debt securities.       Revenues    
  The principal measure of our financial performance is net increase in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment
income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on total return swap, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap.   
  Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating
and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net realized gain or loss on total return swap is the net monthly
settlement payments received on the TRS. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap is the net change
in the fair value of the TRS.      We principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we
hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and
performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized as earned. We may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we hold.   
   Expenses       Our primary
operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses
necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate FSIC III Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. FSIC III Advisor is responsible for compensating
our investment sub-adviser.      We reimburse FSIC III Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our
administration and operations, including FSIC III Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FSIC III Advisor. Such services
include the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations and other administrative services. FSIC III Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required
administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FSIC III Advisor assists us in calculating
our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional
services rendered to us by others. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the reimbursements payable to FSIC III Advisor for administrative services and the methodology for
determining the amount of any such reimbursements. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions. For additional information regarding these expenses, please see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.

   In addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and
administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FSIC III Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade
information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.       Expense Reimbursement    
  Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to reimburse us for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to
ensure that no portion of our distributions to stockholders will be paid from offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments we may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other
distributions to us that are treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, a portion of our distributions to stockholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital to the extent that we may use such dividends or other distribution
proceeds to fund our distributions to stockholders. Under those circumstances, FS Investments will not reimburse us for the portion of such distributions to stockholders that represent a return of capital, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement
arrangement is not to prevent tax-advantaged distributions to stockholders.      Under the expense reimbursement agreement, FS
Investments will reimburse us for expenses in an amount equal to the difference between our cumulative distributions paid to our stockholders in each quarter, less the sum of our net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and dividends
and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts are not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in each quarter.   
  Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, we have a conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments for any amounts funded by
FS Investments under such agreement if (and only to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which FS Investments funded such amount, the sum of our net investment company taxable income, net capital
gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds
the regular cash distributions paid by us to our stockholders; provided, however, that (i) we will only reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments with respect to any calendar quarter to the extent that the payment
of such reimbursement (together with any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause  other operating expenses  (as defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of any expense support payments received by us during
such fiscal year) to exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of our average net assets attributable to shares of our common stock for the fiscal year-to-date period after taking such payments into account and (B) the percentage of our average net assets
attributable to shares of our common stock represented by  other operating expenses  during the fiscal year in which such expense support payment from FS Investments was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any
reimbursement payment which relates to an expense support payment from FS Investments made during the same fiscal year) and (ii) we will not reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments for any calendar quarter if the
annualized rate of regular cash distributions declared by us at the time of such reimbursement payment is less than the annualized rate of regular cash distributions declared by us at the time FS Investments made the expense support payment to which
such reimbursement payment relates. We are not obligated to pay interest on the reimbursements we are required to make to FS Investments under the expense reimbursement agreement.  Other operating expenses  means our total  operating
expenses  (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, offering and organization expenses, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses.  Operating expenses  means
all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for investment companies.      We or FS Investments may terminate the expense reimbursement agreement at any time. FS Investments has indicated that it expects to continue such reimbursements until it deems that we have achieved
economies of   
         72   

Table of Contents  

scale sufficient to ensure that we bear a reasonable level of expenses in relation to our income. The specific amount of expenses reimbursed by FS Investments, if any, will be determined at the
end of each quarter.      Upon termination of the expense reimbursement agreement by FS Investments, FS Investments will be
required to fund any amounts accrued thereunder as of the date of termination. Similarly, our conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments pursuant to the terms of the expense reimbursement agreement shall survive the termination of such
agreement by either party.      As of December 31, 2015, there were no reimbursements payable to us from FS Investments. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not accrue any amounts for expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not receive any cash reimbursements from FS
Investments. As of September 30, 2016, we had no reimbursements due from FS Investments.      As discussed above, under the
expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to us by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by us in the future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $218 in expense recoupments to FS Investments. As of September
30, 2016, we did not have any expense recoupments due to FS Investments and no further amounts remain subject to repayment by us to FS Investments in the future.      FS Investments is controlled by our chairman, president and chief executive officer, Michael C. Forman, and our vice-chairman, David J. Adelman. There can be no assurance that the expense reimbursement
agreement will remain in effect or that FS Investments will reimburse any portion of our expenses in future quarters.       Portfolio Investment
Activity for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and for the Year Ended December 31, 2015       During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $1,104,575. During the same period, we sold investments for proceeds of $410,772 and received principal repayments of $417,080. As of September 30, 2016, our
investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $3,169,349 (64% in first lien senior secured loans, 9% in second lien senior secured loans, 3% in senior secured bonds, 19% in subordinated debt, 0% in collateralized securities and 5% in
equity/other), consisted of interests in 118 portfolio companies. The portfolio companies that comprised our portfolio as of such date had an average annual EBITDA of approximately $171.4 million. As of September 30, 2016, the debt investments in
our portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 98.0% of par and our estimated gross portfolio yield, prior to leverage, was 9.3% based upon the amortized cost of our investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total
return was 15.11% and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was 14.52%.      Based on our regular weekly
cash distribution amount of $0.013461 per share as of September 30, 2016 and our institutional offering price of $8.42 per share as of such date, the annualized distribution rate to stockholders as of September 30, 2016 was 8.32%. The annualized
distribution rate to stockholders is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share divided by our institutional offering price per share as of September 30, 2016. Our annualized distribution rate to
stockholders may include income, realized capital gains and a return of investors  capital.      During the year ended
December 31, 2015, we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $2,647,079. During the same period, we sold investments for proceeds of $301,909 and received principal repayments of $117,353. As of December 31, 2015, our investment
portfolio, with a total fair value of $2,744,630 (68% in first lien senior secured loans, 10% in second lien senior secured loans, 3% in senior secured bonds, 17% in subordinated debt, 0% in collateralized securities and 2% in equity/other),
consisted of interests in 130 portfolio companies. The portfolio companies that comprised our portfolio as of such date had an average   
         73   

Table of Contents  

annual EBITDA of approximately $212.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, the debt investments in our portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 97.5% of par and our estimated
gross portfolio yield, prior to leverage, was 9.8% based upon the amortized cost of our investments. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our total return was (1.48)% and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was
(0.93)%.      Our estimated gross portfolio yield may be higher than a stockholder s yield on an investment in shares of our
common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us. In addition, our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures disclosed above do not consider the effect of any selling
commissions or charges that may have been incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield, total returns and annualized distribution rate to stockholders do not represent actual investment
returns to stockholders, are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See the section entitled  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. See footnotes 6 and 7 to the table included in Note 10 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for information

    Portfolio Composition by Strategy and Industry    
  The table below summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio by strategy and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the
total portfolio assets in such strategies as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
    The table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair
value, of the total portfolio assets in such industries as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
    As of September 30, 2016, except for Aspect Software, Inc., in which we had two senior secured loans, one
of which was a partially unfunded commitment, a subordinated debt investment and an equity/other investment, and Fairway Group Acquisition Co., in which we had three senior secured loans and an equity/other investment, we were not an
 affiliated person  of any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, we did not  control  any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2015, we did not
 control  and were not an  affiliated person  of any of our portfolio companies, each as defined in the 1940 Act. In general, under the 1940 Act, we would be presumed to  control  a portfolio company if we owned more
than 25% of its voting securities or we had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company, and would be an  affiliated person  of a portfolio company if we owned 5% or more of its voting
securities.

   Our investment portfolio may contain loans and other unfunded arrangements that are in the
form of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, delayed draw credit facilities or other investments, pursuant to which we may be required to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying
agreements. As of September 30, 2016, we had twenty-one unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $192,653. As of December 31, 2015, we had twenty-one unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of
$267,776 and two unfunded commitments to purchase up to $467 and $369, respectively, in shares of preferred stock of Altus Power America Holdings, LLC and common equity of Sunnova Holdings, LLC. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available
borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. For additional details regarding our unfunded debt investments, see our unaudited consolidated schedule of investments as of September 30, 2016 and our audited
consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2015.       Portfolio Asset Quality    
  In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FSIC III Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor
the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FSIC III Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:

fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
    The amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period
resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in
investment values.

    Results of Operations        Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015        Revenues
      We generated investment income of $85,383 and $53,756 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, in the form of interest and fees earned on senior secured loans (first and second lien), senior secured bonds, subordinated debt and collateralized securities. Such revenues represent $78,640 and $51,054 of cash income earned as well
as $6,743 and $2,702 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting
periods or years after such revenues are recognized.      During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated
$75,358 and $44,166, respectively, of interest income, which represented 88.3% and 82.2%, respectively, of total investment income. The increase in interest income was due primarily to the growth of our investment portfolio and the increase in the
number of directly originated loans in our portfolio over the last year. The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We
expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases and the proportion of directly originated investments in our investment portfolio increases.   
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $10,025 and $9,590, respectively, of fee income, which
represented 11.7% and 17.8% respectively, of total investment income. Such fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees, structuring fees, amendment and consent fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee
income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of prepayments and other events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.       Expenses       Our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were $42,949 and $22,629, respectively. Our operating expenses include base management fees attributed to FSIC III Advisor of $17,403 and $10,737 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our operating
expenses also include administrative services expenses attributed to FSIC III Advisor of $987 and $616 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      FSIC III Advisor is eligible to receive incentive fees based on our performance. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on income of $12,037 and
$6,443, respectively, based on the performance of the portfolio. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not accrue any capital gains incentive fees on income based on the performance of our portfolio. See
  Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fee  and   Critical Accounting Policies Subordinated Income Incentive Fee  for additional information about how the incentive fees are calculated.
     We recorded interest expense of $10,315 and $3,358 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in
connection with our financing arrangements. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, fees and expenses incurred with our fund administrator, which provides various accounting and administrative services to us, totaled $260 and $198,
respectively, and fees and expenses incurred with our stock transfer agent totaled $395 and $414, respectively. Fees for our board of directors were $249 and $213 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of
our deferred offering costs was $382 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Prior to January 1, 2016, offering costs were offset against capital in excess of par value on the consolidated financial statements.

   Our other general and administrative expenses totaled $921 and $650 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of the following:       
    During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the ratio of our operating expenses to our
average net assets was 1.95% and 1.40%, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the ratio of our total operating expenses to our average net assets, which includes $1,601 of expense recoupments payable to FS Investments was
1.50%. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the ratio of our operating expenses to average net assets included $10,315 and $3,358, respectively, related to interest expense, $12,037 and $6,443, respectively, related to accruals
for incentive fees and $382 and $0, respectively, related to the amortization of offering costs. Without such expenses, our ratio of operating expenses to average net assets would have been 0.92% and 0.79% for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Incentive fees and interest expense, among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in amounts outstanding under our
financing arrangements and benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR, among other factors.       Expense Reimbursement    
  Under the expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to us by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by us in future
periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid $0 and $1,328, respectively, in expense recoupments to FS Investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we accrued $0 and $1,601, respectively, for
expense recoupments payable to FS Investments. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any expense recoupments due to FS Investments and no further amounts remain subject to repayment by us to FS Investments in the future. See
  Overview Expense Reimbursement  for a discussion of the expense reimbursement agreement.       Net Investment Income
      Our net investment income totaled $42,434 ($0.16 per share) and $29,526 ($0.16 per share) for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       Net Realized Gains or Losses    
  We sold investments and received principal repayments of $136,016 and $215,912, respectively, during the three months ended September 30,
2016, from which we realized a net loss of $14,333. We sold investments and received principal repayments of $52,562 and $15,094, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, from which we realized a net loss of $22,799.
During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we earned $2,541 and $2,412, respectively, from periodic net settlement payments on our TRS, which are reflected as realized gains.       Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Secured Borrowing and Total Return Swap       For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled $80,298, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the
secured borrowing

was $(160) and the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our TRS was $15,953. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the net change in unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on investments totaled $(76,230) and the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our TRS was $(8,061). The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments and TRS during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was primarily driven by improvement in the high yield markets, a general tightening of credit spreads and specific improvements with respect to certain of our energy investments.   
   Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations       For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $126,733 ($0.48 per share) and $(75,152) ($(0.40) per share), respectively.   
   Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015        Revenues       We generated investment income of $240,675 and $117,267 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the form of interest and fees earned on senior secured loans (first and second lien), senior secured bonds, subordinated debt and collateralized securities. Such revenues represent
$221,992 and $110,536 of cash income earned as well as $18,683 and $6,731 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows related to such
non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.      During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $220,143 and $97,460, respectively, of interest income, which represented 91.5% and 83.1%, respectively, of total investment income. The increase in interest income was due primarily to the
growth of our investment portfolio and the increase in the number of directly originated loans in our portfolio over the last year. The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments
multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases and the proportion of directly originated
investments in our investment portfolio increases.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated
$20,532 and $19,807, respectively, of fee income, which represented 8.5% and 16.9%, respectively, of total investment income. Such fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees, structuring fees, amendment and consent
fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of prepayments and other events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.   
   Expenses       Our operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $115,036 and $45,974, respectively. Our operating expenses include base management fees attributed to FSIC III Advisor of $49,750 and $25,482 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Our operating expenses also include administrative services expenses attributed to FSIC III Advisor of $2,334 and $1,605 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  FSIC III Advisor is eligible to receive incentive fees based on our performance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, we accrued a subordinated incentive fee on income of $27,431 and $8,397, respectively, based on the performance of the portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not accrue any capital gains incentive fees on
income based on the performance of our portfolio. See   Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fee  and   Critical Accounting Policies Subordinated Income Incentive Fee  for additional
information about how the incentive fees are calculated.

from operations was $294,373 ($1.13 per share) and $(23,119) ($(0.15) per share), respectively.       Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources        Overview       As of September 30, 2016, we had $200,825 in cash, which we and our wholly-owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and $116,000 in cash held as collateral by Citibank under the terms of
the TRS. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we had $104,300 in borrowings available under our other financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2016, we also had broadly syndicated investments and
opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2016, we had twenty-one debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $192,653. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and
liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.      We currently generate cash primarily from the net
proceeds of our continuous public offering and the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments, as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales
of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FSIC III Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940
Act. See   Financing Arrangements.       Prior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the
cash received from the net proceeds from our continuous public offering, from the issuance of shares of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan, from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and
proceeds from sales of our investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC
election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.

    Continuous Public Offering, Private Placement and Distribution Reinvestment Plan    
  We are engaged in a continuous public offering of our common stock. We accept subscriptions on a continuous basis and issue shares at
weekly closings at prices that must be above our net asset value per share.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we issued 29,970,095 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $251,540 at an average price per share of $8.39. The gross proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include reinvested stockholder distributions of $72,161
for which we issued 8,922,378 shares of common stock. The selling commissions and dealer manager fees related to the sale of our common stock was $9,992 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This amount includes $1,961 in dealer manager fees
retained by the dealer manager, FS Investment Solutions, which is one of our affiliates.      Since commencing our continuous
public offering and through November 1, 2016, we have issued 272,098,970 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $2,607,015. As of November 1, 2016, we had raised total gross proceeds of $2,619,002, including $200 of seed capital
contributed by the principals of FSIC III Advisor in October 2013 and $11,787 in proceeds raised in a private placement completed in April 2014 from the principals of FSIC III Advisor, certain members of our board of directors and other individuals
and entities affiliated with FSIC III Advisor and GDFM.      In February 2016, we closed our continuous public offering to
investors investing through the IBD Channel. We are currently offering shares of our common stock pursuant to our continuous public offering only to persons who purchase through the Institutional Channel and certain affiliated investors who
purchase through the dealer manager. Historically, sales though the IBD Channel have constituted the majority of shares sold in our continuous public offering. Prior to the IBD Channel closing, shares of our common stock in our continuous
public offering were subject to a sales load of up to 10.0% of the public offering price, which consisted of selling commissions and dealer manager fees of up to 7.0% and 3.0%, respectively, of the public offering price. Following the IBD
Channel closing, shares of common stock in our continuous public offering have been sold at an Institutional offering price that does not include any selling commissions or dealer manager fees.   
   Share Repurchase Program    
  To provide our stockholders with limited liquidity, we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers pursuant to our share
repurchase program. The first such tender offer commenced in August 2014, and the repurchase occurred in connection with our October 1, 2014 weekly closing.      The following table provides information concerning our repurchases of shares of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   
   
    On October 5, 2016, we repurchased 2,030,975 shares of common stock (representing 100% of the shares
of common stock tendered for repurchase and 0.76% of the shares outstanding as of such date) at $8.505 per share for aggregate consideration totaling $17,273.

   For additional information regarding our share repurchase program, see Note 3 to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein.       Financing Arrangements    
  We borrow funds to make investments to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional
investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our
stockholders. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred stock.      The following table presents summary information
with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of September 30, 2016:

  On August 29, 2016, Burholme Funding entered into an amendment to the prime brokerage facility with BNPP to, among other things, (i) increase the interest rate
payable on borrowings under the committed facility agreement from three-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points to three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points effective on and after January 2, 2017 and (ii) increase the commitment fee payable under the
committed facility agreement from 55 basis points on all unused amounts to, effective on and after January 2, 2017, (a) 65 basis points on unused amounts so long as 75% or more of the facility amount under the committed facility agreement is
utilized or (b) 85 basis points on unused amounts if less than 75% of the facility amount under the committed facility agreement is utilized.

  As described in Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein, this facility generally is terminable upon 270 days  notice by either
party. As of September 30, 2016, neither party to the facility had provided notice of its intent to terminate the facility.        Our average borrowings and weighted average interest rate, including the effect of non-usage fees, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,181,930 and 3.07%, respectively. As of September 30,
2016, our weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings, including the effect of non-usage fees, was 3.16%.      For
additional information regarding our financing arrangements, see Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein.   
   RIC Status and Distributions       We have elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, make distributions of an amount at least equal to 90% of our
investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, each tax year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of a tax year or
the due date of the tax return for such tax year, including extensions, distributions paid up to twelve months after   
         85

the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify
for and maintain our RIC tax status each tax year. We are also subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we make distributions in a timely manner to our stockholders generally of an amount at least
equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses,
or  capital gain net income  (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were
not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and
actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. stockholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We can offer no
assurance that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions. If we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated
by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.      Subject to applicable legal
restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we currently intend to declare regular cash distributions on a quarterly basis and pay such distributions on a monthly basis to stockholders of record, as determined on a weekly basis.
We will calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each stockholder s distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept such stockholder s subscription for
shares of our common stock. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. The timing and amount of any future distributions to
stockholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors.      During certain
periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder s investment rather than a
return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FSIC III Advisor. Each year a
statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on the sale of securities, and/or a return of capital, which is a non-taxable distribution) will be mailed to
our stockholders. No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 represented a return of capital.      We intend to continue to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, unless stockholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional
shares of our common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. stockholder.      The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we declared and paid on our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Table of Contents  

   On August 4, 2016 and November 4, 2016, our board of directors declared regular weekly cash
distributions for October 2016 through December 2016 and January 2017 through March 2017, respectively, each in the amount of $0.013461 per share. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to stockholders of record as of weekly record
dates previously determined by our board of directors.      We have adopted an  opt in  distribution reinvestment plan
for our stockholders. As a result, if we make a cash distribution, our stockholders will receive the distribution in cash unless they specifically  opt in  to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions
reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. However, certain state authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a stockholder s ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment
plan.      Under the distribution reinvestment plan, cash distributions to participating stockholders are reinvested in additional
shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to the institutional offering price in effect on the date of issuance. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state
and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders who elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. Stockholders
receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of the fair market value of our shares of common stock.   
  We may fund our cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds legally available to us, including offering proceeds,
borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets and dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity
investments in portfolio companies and expense reimbursements from FS Investments. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay
distributions at a specific rate or at all.      Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to
reimburse us for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of our distributions to stockholders will be paid from our offering proceeds or borrowings. For a period of time following commencement of our continuous public
offering, which time period may be significant, substantial portions of our distributions have been, and may in the future, be funded through the reimbursement of certain expenses by FS Investments and its affiliates, including through the waiver of
certain investment advisory fees by FSIC III Advisor, that are subject to repayment by us within three years. Any such distributions funded through expense reimbursements or waivers of advisory fees are not based on our investment performance, and
can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or FS Investments continues to make such reimbursements or waivers of such fees. Our future repayments of amounts reimbursed or waived by FS Investments or its
affiliates will reduce the distributions that stockholders would otherwise receive in the future. FS Investments and its affiliates have no obligation to waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods.

   The following table reflects the sources of the cash distributions on a tax basis that we
have paid on our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       
     
    Our net investment income on a tax basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $136,892 and $79,307, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $11,029 and
$10,089, respectively, of undistributed net investment income and $54,394 and $24,134, respectively, of accumulated capital losses on a tax basis.      See Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to
our tax-basis net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.       Critical Accounting Policies    
  Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of
management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial
statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing
the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to
materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our
operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.       Valuation of Portfolio Investments       We determine the net asset value of our
investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, FSIC III Advisor provides our board of directors with portfolio company valuations
which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation
services.   
         88

   Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure ,
or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and
annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which
includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market
data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.      With respect to investments for which market
quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:       

our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FSIC III Advisor s management team reviewing and documenting valuations of each portfolio company
or investment, which valuations may be obtained from an independent third-party valuation service, if applicable;          

FSIC III Advisor s management team then provides the valuation committee with the preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment;

preliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;      

the valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FSIC III Advisor s management team, together with our independent third-party
valuation services, if applicable, supplement the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;          

following its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of directors approve our fair valuations; and      

our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various
statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FSIC III Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.      
  Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements
refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of directors may use any approved
independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of directors is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information
obtained from FSIC III Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of directors deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FSIC III
Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.   
  Valuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest
rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash
flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the
quality of collateral securing our debt investments.   
         89   

Table of Contents  

   For convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the
debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.   
  Our equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of directors,
in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon
the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.
     FSIC III Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors
may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair
value. FSIC III Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply
discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of directors, in consultation with
FSIC III Advisor s management team and any approved independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market
quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.   
  When we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security,
the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of directors subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities
received at their fair value.      The fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of directors. Our
board of directors is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of directors has delegated
day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FSIC III Advisor s management team, and has authorized FSIC III Advisor s management team to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been
approved by our board of directors. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FSIC III Advisor s implementation of the valuation process.      Our investments as of September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Forty-eight senior secured loan investments, two senior secured bond
investments and eleven subordinated debt investments, for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the
borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the investments. Except as described below, all of our
equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios
and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. Two equity/other investments, which were traded on an active public market, were valued at their closing price as of September 30,
2016. Except as described above, we valued our other investments, including three equity/other investments, by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by
independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services.

   Our investments as of December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of debt investments that
were acquired directly from the issuer. Forty senior secured loan investments, two senior secured bond investments and seven subordinated debt investments, for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by independent valuation firms, which
determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features, anticipated
prepayments and other relevant terms of the investments. All of our equity/other investments were also valued by independent valuation firms, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights
ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. Two senior secured loan investments, which were newly issued and
purchased near December 31, 2015, were valued at cost, as our board of directors determined that the cost of each such investment was the best indication of its fair value. Except as described above, we valued our other investments by using the
midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by independent third-party pricing services and screened for validity by such services.   
  We value the TRS in accordance with the TRS agreement. Pursuant to the TRS agreement, the value of the TRS is based on the increase or
decrease in the value of the loans underlying the TRS, together with accrued interest income, interest expense and certain other expenses incurred under the TRS. The loans underlying the TRS are valued by Citibank. Citibank bases its valuation on
the indicative bid prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that market participants may be willing to pay. These valuations are sent to us for review and testing. Our valuation committee
and board of directors review and approve the value of the TRS, as well as the value of the loans underlying the TRS, on a quarterly basis as part of their quarterly determination of net asset value. To the extent our valuation committee or board of
directors has any questions or concerns regarding the valuation of the loans underlying the TRS, such valuation is discussed or challenged pursuant to the terms of the TRS agreement. See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements
included herein for additional information on the TRS.      We periodically benchmark the bid and ask prices we receive from the
third-party pricing services and/or dealers, as applicable, against the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of our management in purchasing and selling these
investments, we believe that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value. However, because of the private nature of this marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), we believe that these valuation inputs are
classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. We may also use other methods, including the use of an independent valuation firm, to determine fair value for securities for which we cannot obtain prevailing bid and ask prices through
third-party pricing services or independent dealers, or where our board of directors otherwise determines that the use of such other methods is appropriate. We periodically benchmark the valuations provided by the independent valuation firms against
the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our investments. The valuation committee and our board of directors reviewed and approved the valuation determinations made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with our valuation
policy.       Revenue Recognition       Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend
date. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income. Our policy is to place investments on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest
income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited to, the delinquency status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the
overall financial condition of the underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances relevant to the investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any
previously accrued interest, then the interest income will be written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal   
         91   

Table of Contents  

depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are likely to
remain current based on our judgment.      Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and
we amortize such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring
and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when we receive such amounts.       Net Realized Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency    
  Gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses
by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized fees. Net change in
unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. Net change in
unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency reflects the change in the value of receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.   
  We follow the guidance in ASC Topic 860 when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. This guidance requires a
participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a participating interest, as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a
participating interest remain on our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the participation or other partial loan sale meets the definition. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond
with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.       Capital Gains Incentive Fee    
  Pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined
and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of such agreement). Such fee will equal 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of
the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue
for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.      While
the investment advisory and administrative services agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the
incentive fees that would be payable to FSIC III Advisor if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though FSIC III Advisor is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless
and until such gains are actually realized.      Based on an interpretation of the applicable language in the Advisers Act by the
staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC, we  look through  our TRS in calculating the capital gains incentive fee. Under this  look through  methodology, the portion of the net settlement payments received by us
pursuant to the TRS which would have represented net investment income to us had we held the loans underlying the TRS   
         92   

Table of Contents  

directly is treated as net investment income subject to the subordinated incentive fee on income payable to FSIC III Advisor pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services
agreement, rather than as realized capital gains in accordance with GAAP, and any unrealized depreciation on individual loans underlying the TRS further reduces the capital gains incentive fee payable to FSIC III Advisor with respect to realized
gains. See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the TRS.       Subordinated Income
Incentive Fee       Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC III Advisor may also be
entitled to receive a subordinated incentive fee on income. The subordinated incentive fee on income, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of our  pre-incentive fee net investment income  for the immediately
preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital equal to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. For purposes of this fee,  adjusted capital  means cumulative
gross proceeds generated from sales of our common stock (including proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program. As a result, FSIC III Advisor will not earn
this part of the incentive fee for any quarter until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once our pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FSIC III
Advisor will be entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375%, or 9.375%
annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FSIC III Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income.   
   Offering Costs       Our
offering costs primarily include, among other things, marketing expenses and printing, legal and due diligence fees and other costs pertaining to our continuous public offering of shares of our common stock. Historically, we charged offering costs
against capital in excess of par value on our consolidated balance sheets. Following recent discussions with the Staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC, we decided to change our accounting treatment of offering costs and defer and
amortize such costs to expense over twelve months. We evaluated this change in accounting treatment of offering costs, which we implemented effective January 1, 2016, and determined that it did not have a material impact on our previously
reported consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein and   Related Party Transactions Compensation of the Investment Adviser and
Dealer Manager.        Uncertainty in Income Taxes       We evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be
taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is
 more likely than not  to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur any interest or penalties.       Contractual Obligations
      We have entered into an agreement with FSIC III Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative
services. Payments for investment advisory services under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee based on the average weekly
  
         93   

Table of Contents  

value of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. FSIC III Advisor, and to the extent it is required to provide such services, GDFM, are reimbursed for
administrative expenses and/or organization and offering costs incurred on our behalf, as applicable. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included herein and   Related Party Transactions Compensation of the Investment
Adviser and Dealer Manager  for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under this agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
  A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations related to the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness at September 30,
2016 is as follows:       

(1)  
  At September 30, 2016, $62,300 remained unused under the BNP facility. The BNP facility generally is terminable upon 270 days  notice by either party. As of
September 30, 2016, neither party to the facility had provided notice of its intent to terminate the facility.         

(2)  
  At September 30, 2016, $42,000 amounts remained unused under the Deutsche Bank credit facility. Amounts outstanding under the Deutsche Bank credit facility will mature,
and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on September 22, 2019.

   Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager       Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC III Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average weekly value of our gross assets and an
incentive fee based on our performance. We commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement on April 2, 2014, upon commencement of our investment operations. Management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in
arrears. FSIC III Advisor has agreed, effective in February 2017 (one year following the IBD Channel closing), to waive a portion of the base management fee so that the fee received equals 1.75% of our average weekly gross assets.

   The dealer manager for our continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, which is
one of our affiliates. Prior to the IBD Channel closing, the dealer manager was entitled to receive selling commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of shares of common stock in our continuous public offering, all or a portion
of which could be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers. Following the IBD Channel closing, the dealer manager has waived its right to receive any selling commissions or dealer manager fees in connection with shares of our common stock sold pursuant
to our continuous public offering and, as a result, no selling commissions or dealer manager fees will be paid to the dealer manager from that date forward.      The following table describes the fees and expenses we accrued under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement and the dealer manager fees FS Investment Solutions received under the
dealer manager agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Item 3.   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (in thousands).         We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, 70.5% of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates, 24.9% paid
fixed interest rates, 4.5% were non-income producing equity or other investments and the remaining 0.1% were income producing equity/other investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest
rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income
from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it
easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to FSIC III Advisor with
respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income.      Pursuant to the terms of the TRS between Center City
Funding and Citibank, Center City Funding pays fees to Citibank at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.55% per annum on the utilized notional amount of the loans subject to the TRS in exchange for the right to receive the economic
benefit of a pool of loans having a maximum notional amount of $500,000. Pursuant to the terms of the BNP facility, Deutsche Bank credit facility, JPM credit facility, Goldman facility and the Capital One credit facility, borrowings are at a
floating rate based on LIBOR. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to
changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or our subsidiaries have such debt outstanding, or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income,
especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments.      The following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of
changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income, assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangements in effect
as of September 30, 2016:       

(1)  
  Assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. Includes the net effect of the change in interest rates on the unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on the TRS. Pursuant to the TRS, Center City Funding receives from Citibank all interest payable in respect of the loans included in the TRS and pays to Citibank interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.55% per
annum on the utilized notional amount of the loans subject to the TRS. As of September 30, 2016, 96.6% of the loans underlying the TRS (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates.     
  We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate
risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from
changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not engage in interest rate
hedging activities.      In addition, we may have risk regarding portfolio valuation. See  Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Valuation of Portfolio Investments.

   Controls and Procedures.          Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
September 30, 2016.      Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations.       Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting       There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
