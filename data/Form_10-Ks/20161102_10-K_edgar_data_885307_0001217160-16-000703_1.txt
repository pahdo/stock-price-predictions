   Forward-Looking Statements   
   
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like  plans ,  expects ,  aims ,  believes ,  projects ,  anticipates ,  intends ,  estimates ,  will ,  should ,  could  and similar expressions in connection with any discussion, expectation, or projection of future operating or financial performance, events or trends.  Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.  Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from these expectations and assumptions due to changes in global political, economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. 
   
 These factors include, but are not limited to the fact that the Company is in a highly competitive business and may seek additional financing to expand its business, and are set forth in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, including in the sections, ITEM 1A,  Risk Factors , and ITEM 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
   
   Introduction   
   
 Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. is organized under the laws of British Columbia, Canada.  In this Annual Report, the  Company ,  we ,  our  and  us  refer to Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. and its subsidiaries.   
   
 The Company s operations are classified into four reportable segments which were determined based on the nature of the products offered along with the markets being served.  The segments are as follows: 
   
 Industrial wood products 
   
 Lawn, garden, pet and other 
   
 Seed processing and sales 
   
 Industrial tools and clamps 
   
 Effective September 1, 2013, the Company reorganized certain of its subsidiaries. Jewett-Cameron Lumber Corporation ( JCLC ) was changed to JC USA Inc. ( JC USA ), which has the following four wholly-owned subsidiaries.   
   
 The industrial wood products segment reflects the business conducted by Greenwood Products, Inc. ( Greenwood ).  Greenwood is a processor and distributor of industrial wood products.  A major product category is treated plywood that is sold to boat manufacturers and the transportation industry. 
   
 The lawn, garden, pet and other segment reflects the business of the newly incorporated Jewett-Cameron Company ( JCC ). JCC is a wholesaler of wood products and a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products formerly conducted by JCLC. Wood products include fencing and landscape timbers, while metal products include dog kennels, proprietary gate support systems, perimeter fencing, and greenhouses.  JCC uses contract manufacturers to make the specialty metal products.  Some of the products that JCC distributes flow through the Company s distribution center located in North Plains, Oregon, and some are shipped direct to the customer from the manufacturer.  Primary customers are home centers and other retailers.   
   
 The seed processing and sales segment reflects the business of Jewett-Cameron Seed Company ( JCSC ). JCSC processes and distributes agricultural seed.  Most of this segment s sales come from selling seed to distributors with a lesser amount of sales derived from cleaning seed. 
   
 The industrial tools and clamps segment reflects the business of MSI-PRO ( MSI ).  MSI imports and distributes products including pneumatic air tools, industrial clamps, and saw blades.  These products are primarily sold to retailers that in turn sell to contractors and end users. 
   
 JC USA provides professional and administrative services, including accounting and credit services, to each of its wholly-owned subsidiary companies. 

Total Company sales were approximately $48.1 and $42.2 million during fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   General Development of Business   
   
  Incorporation and Subsidiaries  
   
 Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. was incorporated under the Company Act of British Columbia on July 8, 1987 as a holding company for Jewett-Cameron Lumber Corporation ( JCLC ), which was incorporated in September 1953.  Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. acquired all the shares of JCLC through a stock-for-stock exchange on July 13, 1987, and at that time JCLC became a wholly owned subsidiary.  Effective September 1, 2013, the Company completed a reorganization of certain of its subsidiaries and JCLC s name was changed to JC USA Inc. ( JC USA ). JC USA has the following wholly owned subsidiaries.  MSI-PRO Co. ( MSI ), incorporated in April 1996, Jewett-Cameron Seed Company, ( JCSC ), incorporated in October 2000, Greenwood Products, Inc. ( Greenwood ), incorporated in February 2002, and Jewett-Cameron Company ( JCC ) incorporated in September 2013.  Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. and its subsidiaries have no significant assets in Canada. 
   
  Corporate Development  
   
 Incorporated in 1953, JC USA operated as a small lumber wholesaler based in Portland, Oregon.  In September 1984, the original stockholders sold their interest in the corporation to a new group of investors.  Two members of that group remain active in the Company.  These individuals are Donald Boone, the President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Director and Principal Financial Officer; and Michael Nasser, Corporate Secretary. 
   
 In July 1987, the Company acquired JC USA in what was not an arms-length transaction. 
   
 In early 1986, prior to JC USA being acquired by the Company, JC USA acquired Material Supply International ( Material Supply ).  Material Supply was engaged in the importation and distribution of pneumatic air tools and industrial clamps.  The product line was re-branded as  MSI-PRO  and MSI was incorporated in 1996 to carry-on the business of Material Supply. 
   
 In October 2000, JCSC was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of a firm called Agrobiotech Inc.  JCSC operates as a seed storage, processing and sales business. 
   
 In February 2002, Greenwood was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of Greenwood Forest Products Inc.  Greenwood is involved in the processing and distribution of specialty wood products. 
   
 In June 2012, the Company acquired land and fixed assets located in Manning, Oregon for $250,000 cash. 

Narrative Description of Business   
   
 The Company s operations are classified into four segments.  Sales, income before taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and interest expense by segment are shown in the footnotes to the financial statements. 
   
  Industrial Wood Products - Greenwood  
   
 Greenwood is a wholesale distributor of a variety of specialty wood products. Operations are co-located in the building utilized by JCC and MSI. 
   
 Historically, a major product category has been treated plywood that is sold to boat manufacturers and the transportation industry.  In February 2014, the Company sold its excess inventory related to the marine industry. Greenwood s total sales for fiscal 2016 and 2015 were 10% and 11% respectively of total Company sales. 
   
 The markets in which Greenwood competes are sensitive to downturns in the U.S economy.   
   
 Inventory is maintained at non-owned warehouse and wood treating facilities throughout the United States and is primarily shipped to customers on a just-in-time basis.  Inventory is generally not purchased on a speculative basis in anticipation of price changes. 
   
 Greenwood has no significant backlog of orders.   
   
  Lawn, Garden, Pet and Other   JCC   
   
 The lawn, garden, pet and other segment reflects the business of the newly incorporated Jewett-Cameron Company (JCC), which is a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products and a wholesaler of wood products formerly conducted by JCLC.  
   
 JCC operates out of a 5.6 acre owned facility located in North Plains, Oregon that includes an office, a warehouse, a paved yard, and a remanufacturing plant.  This business is a wholesaler of wood products and a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products.  Wood products include fencing and landscape timbers, while metal products include dog kennels, proprietary gate support systems, perimeter fencing, and greenhouses.  JCC uses contract manufacturers to make the specialty metal products.  Some of the products that JCC distributes flow through the Company s facility in North Plains, Oregon, and some are shipped direct to the customer from the manufacturer.  Primary customers are home centers and other retailers.   
   
 The home improvement business is seasonal, with higher levels of sales occurring between February and August.  Inventory buildup occurs until the start of the season in February and then gradually declines to seasonal low levels at the end of the summer.   
   
 JCC has concentrated on building a customer base for lawn, garden, and pet related products.  Management believes this market is less sensitive to downturns in the U.S. economy than is the market for new home construction. 
   
 The wood products that JCC distributes are not unique and are available from multiple suppliers.  However, the metal products that JCC manufactures and distributes may be somewhat differentiated from similar products available from other suppliers. 
   
 JCC owns the patents and manufacturing rights connected with the Adjust-A-Gate and Fit-Right products, which are the gate support systems for wood, vinyl, chain link, and composite fences.  Management believes the ownership of these patents results in an important competitive advantage for these and certain other products. During fiscal 2016, the Company applied for 4 new patents, while 4 other patents were granted.  JCC also has two licensing agreements to market pet products.  
   
 Backlog orders are a factor in this business as customers may place firm priced orders for both wood and metal products for shipments to take place three to four months in the future. 

Seed Processing and Sales - JCSC   
   
 JCSC operates out of an approximately 12 acre owned facility located adjacent to North Plains, Oregon. JCSC processes and distributes agricultural seed.  Most of this segment s sales come from selling seed to distributors with a lesser amount of sales derived from cleaning seed.  Even though the harvest and processing cycle is seasonal, sales of JCSC tend to be fairly uniform throughout the year.  However, profitability around the month of August may be unusually high based on a seasonal surge in cleaning sales, which are much more profitable sales than product sales.  
   
 JCSC has no backlog of sales orders. 
   
  Industrial Tools and Clamps - MSI  
   
 This business operates from the same owned facilities as JCC.  MSI imports and distributes products including pneumatic air tools, industrial clamps, and saw blades.  These products are primarily sold to retailers that in turn sell to contractors and end users.  Sales of these products tend to be relatively uniform throughout the year.   
   
 MSI s product line was expanded in 2007 to include saw blades, digital calipers, and laser guides.  These newer products carry the Avenger Products brand label. 
   
  Customer Concentration  
   
 The top ten customers were responsible for 78% and 71% of total Company sales for the years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 respectively.  Also, the Company s single largest customer was responsible for 33% and 30% of total Company sales for the years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 respectively.  
   
   Employees   
   
 As of August 31, 2016 the Company had 54 full-time employees (August 31, 2015   52 full-time employees).  By segment these employees were located as follows: Greenwood 2, JCC 25, JCSC 9, MSI 5, and JC USA 13.  None of these employees are represented by unions at the Company.  Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. has no direct employees, and the CEO of the Company is employed by JC USA. 
   
   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   
   
 Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report.  There is a great deal of risk involved.  Any of the following risks could affect our business, its financial condition, its potential profits or losses, and could result in you losing your entire investment if our business became insolvent.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties, including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, also may result in decreased revenues, increased expenses or other events which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock. 
   
   Risks Related to Our Common Stock   
   
   We may decide to acquire assets or enter into business combinations, which could be paid for, either wholly or partially with our common stock and if we decide to do this our current shareholders would experience dilution in their percentage of ownership.    
   
 Our Articles of Incorporation give our Board of Directors the right to enter into any contract without the approval of our shareholders.  Therefore, our management could decide to make an investment (buy shares, loan money, etc.) without shareholder approval.  If we acquire an asset or enter into a business combination, this could include exchanging a large amount of our common stock, which could dilute the ownership interest of present stockholders. 
   
   Future stock distributions could be structured in such a way as to be 1) diluting to our current shareholders or 2) could cause a change in control to new investors.   
   
 If we raise additional funds by selling more of our stock, the new stock may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our existing stock.  If common stock is issued in return for additional funds, the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current stockholders.  The result of this would be a lessening of each present stockholder s relative percentage interest in our company.  

The Company s common shares currently trade within the NASDAQ Capital Market in the United States. The common shares also formerly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada until the Company voluntarily delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange on October 11, 2012.  The average daily trading volume of our common stock was approximately 3,540 shares on NASDAQ for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016.  With this limited trading volume, investors could find it difficult to purchase or sell our common stock. 
   
   Risks Related to Our Business   
   
   We could experience a decrease in the demand for our products resulting in lower sales volumes.   
   
 In the past we have at times experienced decreasing products sales with certain customers.  The reasons for this can be generally attributed to: increased competition; general economic conditions; demand for products; and consumer interest rates.  If economic conditions deteriorate or if consumer preferences change, we could experience a significant decrease in profitability. 
   
   If our top customers were lost, we could experience lower sales volumes.    
   
 For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 our top ten customers represented 78% of our total sales, and our single largest customer was responsible for 33% of our total sales. We would experience a significant decrease in sales and profitability and would have to cut back our operations, if these customers were lost and could not be replaced.  Our top ten customers are in located in North America, and are primarily in the retail home improvement industries.   
   
   We could experience delays in the delivery of our products to our customers causing us to lose business.   
   
 We purchase our products from other vendors and a delay in shipment from these vendors to us could cause significant delays in our delivery to our customers.  This could result in a decrease in sales orders to us and we would experience a loss in profitability. 
   
   We could lose our credit agreement and could result in our not being able to pay our creditors.    
   
 We have a line of credit with U.S. Bank in the amount of $3 million, of which $3 million is available.  We are currently in compliance with the requirements of our existing line of credit.  If we lost this credit it could become impossible to pay some of our creditors on a timely basis. 
   
   If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately, which could harm our business and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny.    
   
 We have completed a management assessment of internal controls as prescribed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which we were required to do in connection with our year ended August 31, 2016.  Based on this process we did not identify any material weaknesses. Although we believe our internal controls are operating effectively, we cannot guarantee that in the future we will not identify any material weaknesses in connection with this ongoing process. 
   
   ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS   
          --- No Disclosure Necessary --- 
   
   ITEM 2. PROPERTIES   
   
 The Company s executive offices are located at 32275 NW Hillcrest Street, North Plains, OR 97133.  The 5.6 acre facility, which is owned, consists of 46,000 square feet of covered space (6,000 office, 10,000 manufacturing, and 30,000 warehouse), a little over three acres of paved yard space, and was completed in October 1995.  The facility provides office space for JC USA, including all of the Company s executive offices, and is used as a distribution center to service the Company s customer base for JCC, Greenwood and MSI.  In May 2016, the Company received its final permits for the construction of a warehouse expansion at its headquarters property in North Plains. Construction commenced immediately upon receipt of the required permits, and the completed building will measure 150 feet by 80 feet and a height of 37 feet. The Company anticipates using the new warehouse for several new product lines. 

The property associated with JCSC, which is owned, consists of 11.7 acres of land, 105,000 square feet of buildings, rolling stock, and equipment.  It is currently used for seed processing and storage.  It is located at 31345 NW Beach Road, Hillsboro, OR 97124, which is adjacent to North Plains, OR.  During fiscal 2010, the Company purchased a seed testing lab located at 31895 NW Hillcrest Street, North Plains, OR 97133. The facility is 2,000 square feet and provides testing facilities for JCSC.  The Company formerly leased the property for $729 per month until the expiration of the lease on January 4, 2010.  At that time, the Company exercised its option to buy the land and building for a total cost of $150,946. 
   
 In June 2012, the Company acquired land and fixed assets located in Manning, Oregon for $250,000 cash. The land consists of 7.5 acres and the fixed assets included 12,000 square feet of buildings. The Company has an operating agreement in place with an outside party. 
   
 We believe that our facilities are currently adequate for our requirements, and that our current equipment is in good condition and is suitable for the operations involved.   
   
   ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
   
 A subsidiary was a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in Portland, Oregon, entitled, Greenwood Products, Inc. et al v. Greenwood Forest Products, Inc. et al., Case No. 05-02553 (Multnomah County Circuit Court).   
   
 During fiscal 2002 the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire inventory over a 15 month period with an initial estimated value of $7,000,000 from Greenwood Forest Products, Inc.  During the year ended August 31, 2003, the Company completed the final phase of the inventory acquisition.  As partial consideration for the purchase of the inventory the Company issued two promissory notes, based on its understanding of the value of the inventory purchased.  The Company believes it overpaid the obligation by approximately $820,000.  The holder counterclaimed for approximately $2,400,000.  
   
 Litigation was completed on March 5, 2007, with the court s general judgment and money award.  The net effect was money judgment in favor of Greenwood Forest Products, Inc. for $242,604.  The Company accrued reserves to cover the money judgment related to this dispute.  Both parties filed appeals for review of the court s opinion. 
   
 During the 1st quarter of fiscal 2011, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that the judgment in favor of Jewett Cameron as plaintiffs should be reversed and the judgment in favor of the defendants should stand.  The judgment in favor of the Company was for $819,000 plus attorney s fees.  The judgment against the plaintiffs is for $1,187,137.  The Company appealed the decision to the Oregon Supreme Court. During the 1st quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a litigation loss of $962,137 and interest of $391,988 in addition to the existing litigation reserve of $225,000. Additional interest of $48,790 was recorded during the remainder of fiscal 2011. During the 1st quarter of fiscal 2012 ended November 30, 2011, additional interest of $16,204 was accrued. 
   
 In February 2012, the Company received the decision from the Oregon Supreme Court which was favorable to Jewett Cameron as plaintiff. As a result, the Company has reversed $1,459,832 of the litigation reserve and accrued interest during the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2012 ended February 29, 2012.  The reversal was treated as a one-time gain during the quarter. 
   
 In July 2014, upon remand from the Oregon Supreme Court, the Oregon Court of Appeals has concluded that Greenwood Forest Products, Inc. as defendants are entitled to a new trial, and, as a consequence, ruled that the judgment in favor of Jewett Cameron as plaintiffs should be reversed and the judgment in favor of defendants should stand.  The judgment in favor of the Company was for $819,000 plus attorney s fees.  The judgment against plaintiffs was for $1,187,137.  On August 7, 2014, the Company filed a petition with the Oregon Supreme Court for a review of the Oregon Court of Appeals notice. The petition requests the Oregon Supreme Court review the most recent ruling by the Oregon Court of Appeals, reverse the decision, and affirm the original judgment of the trial court. In September 2015, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled on the Company s petition and has reversed the decision of the Oregon Court of Appeals and remanded the case to back to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings. The Court also denied the defendants  request for a new trial. 
   
 During the year ended August 31, 2015, the Company recorded $26,716 of interest income due to the favorable difference in interest rates between the judgments. During the year ended August 31, 2016, the Company recorded $6,661 of interest income. 

During the year ended August 31, 2016, the Company and Greenwood Forest Products, Inc., settled all litigation between the two companies. The Company made a cash payment of $200,000 to Greenwood Forest Products, Inc., as full settlement and termination of the litigation (the  Settlement Payment ). The litigation expense of $115,990 represents the difference between the Settlement Payment, and the litigation reserve balance on the date of settlement of $84,010 which is net of interest income recognized for the period. 
   
 The Company does not know of any other material, active or pending legal proceedings against them; nor is the Company involved as a plaintiff in any other material proceeding or pending litigation.  The Company knows of no other active or pending proceedings against anyone that might materially adversely affect an interest of the Company.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   
   Fiscal Years Ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015   
   
 Sales totaled $48,110,998 compared to sales of $42,238,151 in fiscal 2015, which was an increase of $5,872,847, or 13.9%. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher sales at JCC. 
   
 Gross margin rose slightly to 20.2% in fiscal 2016 compared to 19.9% in fiscal 2015.  
   
 Operating expenses rose by $627,992 to $6,121,446 in fiscal 2016 from $5,493,454 in fiscal 2015. The increase was due to an increase in wages and employee benefits, which rose to $4,055,948 from $3,396,793 as the Company made an additional 10% contribution to each eligible employee s 401(k) plan as a one-time compensation bonus. Selling, general and administrative fell to $1,789,230 from $1,814,899, and depreciation fell to $276,268 from $281,762. Income from operations rose to $3,615,146 in fiscal 2016 from $2,923,583 in fiscal 2015. 
   
 Including other items, income before income taxes was $3,519,893 in fiscal 2016 compared to $2,955,576 in fiscal 2015. Litigation loss of ($115,990) was related to the settlement of the litigation between the Company and Greenwood Forest Products, Inc. in fiscal 2016. Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment was $5,600 and interest expense was ($27) in fiscal 2016. Interest and other income declined to $15,164 from $31,993 in fiscal 2015. Income tax expense was $1,391,847 in fiscal 2016 compared to $1,181,605 in fiscal 2015. The Company calculates income tax expense based on combined federal and state rates that are currently in effect. 
   
 Net income for fiscal 2016 was $2,125,099, or $0.87 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1,773,971, or $0.69 per basic and diluted share, for fiscal 2015. The income per share was positively affected by the repurchase and cancellation of common shares during both fiscal 2016 and 2015, and the weighted number of shares outstanding was 2,435,650 in fiscal 2016 and 2,581,850 in fiscal 2015. 
   
  Industrial Wood Products - Greenwood   
   
 Sales at Greenwood in fiscal 2016 were $4,704,087, which was an increase of $31,305, or less than 1%, from sales of $4,672,782 in fiscal 2015. Sales have begun to rebound as the Company has obtained new customers and new uses for its products, but due to the continued weakness in the marine industry, overall demand remains below historical levels. In February 2014, the Company sold its excess inventory related to the marine industry in an arm s length transaction. The Company will maintain a readiness to participate in the marine segment when the market rebounds. Greenwood recorded an operating loss of $8,898 in fiscal 2016 compared to an operating profit of $91,552 in fiscal 2015. 
   
  Lawn, Garden, Pet and Other - JCC  
   
 Sales at JCC were $39,286,126 in fiscal 2016 compared to sales of $32,904,189 in fiscal 2015, which was an increase of $6,381,937, or 19%. Operating income at JCC for 2016 was $3,253,673 compared to $2,118,156 in 2015, which was an increase of $1,135,517, or 54%. The increase in sales for 2016 was primarily due to the market s continued acceptance of recently introduced new products and the addition of new small and mid-sized customers. The results in fiscal 2015 were negatively affected by prolonged winter weather across the United States and the West Coast port slowdown which delayed the delivery of product from manufacturers in China. Overall, the operating results of JCC are seasonal with the first two quarters of the fiscal year being much slower than the final two quarters of the fiscal year.

  Seed Processing and Sales - JCSC  
   
 Sales at JCSC were $2,927,408 in fiscal 2016 compared to sales of $2,776,556 in fiscal 2015, which represents an increase of $150,852, or 5%. Although grass seed demand has risen in conjunction with the improvement in the US residential housing market, the sales environment for the segment remains challenging due to the decline in seed cleaning services as more growers clean in-house. Current supplies have also been restricted by the persistent drought in the Western US which have reduced harvested yields. Operating loss at JCSC for the year was $193,208 compared to an operating loss of $23,096 in fiscal 2015. 
   
  Industrial Tools and Clamps - MSI  
   
 Sales at MSI were $1,193,377 in fiscal 2016 compared to sales of $1,884,624 in fiscal 2015, which was a decrease of $691,247, or 37%. The segment has recently become more competitive, and the Company has reduced prices on certain of its products which reduced operating margins. Operating loss at MSI in fiscal 2016 was $100,986 compared to operating income of $86,184 in fiscal 2015. 
   
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
   
   Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2016   
   
 As of August 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $14,450,870 compared to working capital of $15,103,474 as of August 31, 2015, which is a decrease of $652,604.

 Accounts payable decreased by $144,983 to $839,972 which is related to the timing of payments due to suppliers. Accrued liabilities rose to $1,473,792 from $1,024,358, an increase of $449,434. Litigation reserve declined to $Nil from $90,671 as Company settled its outstanding litigation during the period and the entire amount was applied against the amount of the settlement. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, or current ratio, was 7.2 as of August 31, 2016. 
   
 For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, the accounts receivable collection period or DSO was 25 days compared to 32 days for the year ended August 31, 2015. Inventory turnover for the year ended August 31, 2016 was 78 days compared to 94 days for the year ended August 31, 2015. 
   
 During the year the Company repurchased and cancelled 175,538 common shares which used cash of $2,124,579. An additional 15,000 common shares were voluntarily returned by the Company s CEO and cancelled. Purchase of property, plant and equipment used cash of $926,445 as the Company began construction of a warehouse expansion during the year. 
   
 Based on the Company s current working capital position, its policy of retaining earnings, and the line of credit available, the Company has adequate working capital to meet its needs for the coming fiscal year. 
   
   Short-term and Long-term Debt   
   
 External sources of liquidity include a line of credit from U.S. Bank of $3 million, of which $3 million is available. Previously the line of credit was $1 million, but in during fiscal 2015, the Company increased the line of credit borrowing limit to $3 million. 

Borrowing under the line of credit is secured by an assignment of accounts receivable and inventory.  The interest rate is calculated solely on the one month LIBOR rate plus 175 basis points.  As of August 31, 2016 the one month LIBOR rate plus 175 basis points was 2.27% (0.52% + 1.75%). The line of credit has certain financial covenants.  The Company is in compliance with these covenants. 
   
   OTHER MATTERS   
   
   Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments   
   
 The Company currently has no contractual obligations or commercial commitments.  
   
   Inflation   
   
 The Company does not believe that inflation had a material impact during fiscal 2016 or 2015.  Typically, the Company passes price increases on to the customer. 
   
   Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 Management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  On a regular basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
   
 During the year ended August 31, 2016, the Company did not adopt any new accounting policies that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, nor did it make changes to accounting policies. Senior Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 Management has reviewed the new accounting guidance and determined that there is not a material impact on our financial statements. 
   
   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
   
   Interest Rate Risk   
   
 The Company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of August 31, 2016, and the Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
   
 Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company s cash as well as interest paid on debt.  The Company has a line of credit with an interest rate based on published rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment.  The Company is subject to interest rate risk and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate.  The Company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results from operations. 
   
   Foreign Currency Risk   
   
 The Company operates primarily in the United States.  However, a relatively small amount of business is conducted in currencies other than U.S. dollars.  Also, to the extent that the Company uses contract manufacturers in China, currency exchange rates can influence the Company s purchasing costs.

 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Significant estimates incorporated into the Company s consolidated financial statements include the estimated useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets, the estimated allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence, possible product liability and possible product returns, and litigation contingencies and claims. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (cont d ) 
   
  Cash and cash equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.  At August 31, 2016, cash was $4,519,922 compared to $4,416,297 at August 31, 2015.  At August 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no cash equivalents. 
   
  Accounts receivable  
   
 Trade and other accounts receivable are reported at face value less any provisions for uncollectible accounts considered necessary. Accounts receivable primarily includes trade receivables from customers. The Company estimates doubtful accounts on an item-by-item basis and includes over aged accounts as part of allowance for doubtful accounts, which are generally ones that are ninety days or greater overdue.   
   
 The Company extends credit to domestic customers and offers discounts for early payment.  When extension of credit is not advisable, the Company relies on either prepayment or a letter of credit. 
   
  Inventory  
   
 Inventory, which consists primarily of finished goods, is recorded at the lower of cost, based on the average cost method, and market.  Market is defined as net realizable value. An allowance for potential non-saleable inventory due to excess stock or obsolescence is based upon a review of inventory components. 
   
  Property, plant and equipment  
   
 Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.  The Company provides for depreciation over the estimated life of each asset on a straight-line basis over the following periods: 

Intangibles  
   
 The Company s intangible assets have a finite life and are recorded at cost.  The most significant intangible assets are two patents related to gate support systems.  Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the remaining lives of 18 months and 30 months, respectively, and are reviewed annually for impairment. 
   
  Asset retirement obligations  
   
 The Company records the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and normal use of the long-lived assets.  The Company also records a corresponding asset which is amortized over the life of the asset.  Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation is adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time (accretion expense) and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation (asset retirement cost).  The Company does not have any significant asset retirement obligations.

  Impairment of long-lived assets and long-lived assets to be disposed of  
   
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. 
   
  Currency and foreign exchange  
   
 These financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars as the Company's operations are based only in the United States.   
   
 The Company does not have non-monetary or monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.  Any statement of operations transactions in a foreign currency are translated at rates that approximate those in effect at the time of translation.  Gains and losses from translation of foreign currency transactions into U.S. dollars are included in current results of operations. 
   
  Earnings per share  
   
 Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the period. Diluted earnings per common share takes into consideration common shares outstanding (computed under basic earnings per share) and potentially dilutive common shares. 
   
 The earnings per share data for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

Comprehensive income  
   
 The Company has no items of other comprehensive income in any year presented.  Therefore, net income presented in the consolidated statements of operations equals comprehensive income.

  Stock-based compensation  
   
 All stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense in the financial statements and such costs are measured at the fair value of the award.  
   
 No options were granted during the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, and there were no options outstanding on August 31, 2016 or 2015. 
   
  Financial instruments   
   
 The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate such values: 
   
  Cash  - the carrying amount approximates fair value because the amounts consist of cash held at a bank and cash held in short term investment accounts. 
   
  Accounts receivable  - the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term nature and historical collectability. 
   
  Notes receivable -  the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the amount. 
   
  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  - the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the obligations. 
   
 The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 follows: 

The following table presents information about the assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 31, 2016, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and included situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset: 

The fair values of cash are determined through market, observable and corroborated sources.

  Income taxes  
   
 A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carryforwards.  Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
   
 Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 
   
  Shipping and handling costs     
   
 The Company incurs certain expenses related to preparing, packaging and shipping its products to its customers, mainly third-party transportation fees. All costs related to these activities are included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. All costs billed to the customer are included as sales in the consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  Revenue recognition  
   
 The Company recognizes revenue from the sales of lumber, building supply products, industrial wood products, specialty metal products, and other specialty products and tools, when the products are shipped, title passes, and the ultimate collection is reasonably assured.  Revenue from the Company's seed operations is generated from seed processing, handling and storage services provided to seed growers, and by the sales of seed products.  Revenue from the provision of these services and products is recognized when the services have been performed, products sold and collection of the amounts is reasonably assured.

 A summary of property, plant, and equipment as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 follows: 

In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and an estimate of future discounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss will be recognized. Management's estimates of revenues, operating expenses, and operating capital are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of the Company's investments in its assets. Although management has made its best estimate of these factors based on current conditions, it is possible that changes could occur which could adversely affect management's estimate of the net cash flow expected to be generated from its operations.

  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS   
   
 a) 
 A subsidiary was a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in Portland, Oregon, entitled, Greenwood Products, Inc. et al v. Greenwood Forest Products, Inc. et al., Case No. 05-02553 (Multnomah County Circuit Court).   
   
 During fiscal 2002 the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire inventory over a 15 month period with an initial estimated value of $7,000,000 from Greenwood Forest Products, Inc.  During the year ended August 31, 2003, the Company completed the final phase of the inventory acquisition.  As partial consideration for the purchase of the inventory the Company issued two promissory notes, based on its understanding of the value of the inventory purchased.  The Company believes it overpaid the obligation by approximately $820,000.  The holder counterclaimed for approximately $2,400,000.  
   
 Litigation was completed on March 5, 2007, with the court s general judgment and money award.  The net effect was money judgment in favor of Greenwood Forest Products, Inc. for $242,604.  The Company accrued reserves to cover the money judgment related to this dispute.  Both parties filed appeals for review of the court s opinion. 
   
 A series of rulings and appeals between the years ended August 31, 2011 to August 31, 2015, resulted in the Company recognizing aggregate litigation income of $272,695, and aggregate interest expense of $363,366 to August 31, 2015, totaling a net loss of $90,671.

The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, credit insurance and monitoring procedures. The Company performs credit evaluations of its commercial customers but generally does not require collateral to support accounts receivable. 
   
  Volume of business  
   
 The Company has concentrations in the volume of purchases it conducts with its suppliers. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, there were three suppliers which each accounted for greater than 10% of total purchases, and the aggregate purchases amounted to $21,741,249.

   Audit Committee Financial Expert   
   
 Our Board of Directors has determined that Frank G. Magdlen is the  audit committee financial expert , as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K.  Mr. Magdlen is independent as that term is used in Section 240.14a-101 under the Exchange Act and as defined under NASDAQ Rule 4200 9a) (15). 
   
   Audit Committees   
   
 The Company has an audit committee, which recommends to the board of directors the engagement of the independent auditors of the Company and reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the Company s audits, the Company s internal accounting controls, and the professional services furnished by the independent auditors to the Company.  The board of directors, in light of the increased responsibilities placed on the audit committee during 2002 by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC, adopted an Amended and Restated Charter in late 2002. 
   
 The audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of auditors; and concerns about accounting and auditing matters; and has the authority to engage independent counsel and other outside advisors. 
   
 The audit committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the audit committee the authority to grant pre-approvals required by this policy / procedure.  The decisions of any audit committee member to whom authority is delegated to pre-approve a service shall be presented to the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
   
 In accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we introduced a procedure for the review and pre-approval of any services performed by Davidson   Company, LLP Chartered Accountants, including audit services, audit related services, tax services and other services.  The procedure requires that all proposed engagements of Davidson   Company, LLP Chartered Accountants for audit and permitted non-audit services are submitted to the audit committee for approval prior to the beginning of any such services. 
   
 The current members of the audit committee are Frank Magdlen (Chairman), Ralph Lodewick, and Adrian Russell-Falla.  All current members of the audit committee are  independent  within the meaning of the new regulations from the SEC regarding audit committee membership. 
   
 The audit committee met two times in fiscal 2015 and two times in fiscal 2016. 

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.   
   
 The Company has reviewed the Forms 3 and 4 furnished to the Company under Rule 16a-3(e) of the Securities Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year and the Forms 5 furnished to the Company with respect to its most recent fiscal year, as well as any written representations received by the Company from persons required to file such forms, and management has determined that a Form 4 filed by Donald Boone on June 22, 2016 was not filed on a timely basis. 
   
 Other than the Form 4 filing named above, there were no other reports that failed to be filed on a timely basis as required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year. 
   
   Code of Ethics   
   
 The Company has a written  code of ethics  that meets the United States' Sarbanes-Oxley standards.  The code is posted on the Company s website. 
   
   Limitation of Liability and Indemnification    
   
 Our certificate of incorporation limits the personal liability of our board members for breaches by them of their fiduciary duties.  Our bylaws also require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by British Columbia law. British Columbia law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for any of the following acts:  
   
 a.  
 any breach of their duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders; 
 b.  
 acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; 
 c.  
 unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions or other distributions; and 
 d.  
 any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 
   
 Such limitation of liability may not apply to liabilities arising under the federal securities laws and does not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission.  In addition, British Columbia laws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in such capacity, regardless of whether indemnification would be permitted under British Columbia law.  We currently maintain liability insurance for our directors and executive officers. 
   
 Among other things, this will provide for indemnification of our directors and executive officers for certain expenses (including attorneys  fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of the Company, arising out of such person s services as a director or executive officer of ours, any subsidiary of ours or any other company or enterprise to which the person provided services at our request.  We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers. 
   
   ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   
   
 Table No. 6 details compensation paid or accrued for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 for the Company s chief executive officer, each of the Company s most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers at the end of the most recently completed financial year and whose total salary and bonus exceeds $100,000 per year. 

Table No. 6 
 Summary Compensation Table 
 Executive Officers 

(1) 
 Effective April 1, 2015, Donald Boone voluntarily reduced his salary from $36,000 annually to $9.25 hourly. 
 (2) 
 Murray Smith resigned as Chief Financial Officer effective June 15, 2015. 
   
 The Company may grant stock options to directors, executive officers and employees.  The Company has a 401(k) Plan which allows for a non-elective discretionary contribution based on the first $60,000 of eligible compensation. 
   
 Other than participation in the Company s stock option plan and 401(k), no funds were set aside or accrued during fiscal 2016 to provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. 
   
 The Company has no plans or arrangements with respect to remuneration received or that may be received by executive officers of the Company to compensate such executive officers in the event of termination of employment (as a result of resignation, retirement, change of control) or a change of responsibilities following a change of control. 
   
 No executive officer or director received other compensation in excess of the lesser of $25,000 or 10% of such officer's cash compensation, and all executive officers or directors as a group did not receive other compensation, which exceeded $25,000 times the number of persons in the group or 10% of the compensation. 
   
 Except for our 401(k) Plan we have no material stock option plan, bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers.  Michael Nasser received bonuses, which were determined by the Chief Executive Officer. 

Stock Options   
   
 The Company may grant stock options to purchase securities to directors and employees on terms and conditions acceptable to the regulatory authorities in Canada, notably the Ontario Securities Commission and the British Columbia Securities Commission.  The Company has no formal written stock option plan. 
   
 Under our stock option program, stock options for up to 10% of the number of our issued and outstanding common shares may be granted from time to time, provided that stock options in favor of any one individual may not exceed 5% of our issued and outstanding common shares.  No stock option granted under the stock option program is transferable by the optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and each stock option is exercisable during the lifetime of the optionee only by such optionee. 
   
 The exercise price of all stock options granted under the stock option program must be at least equal to the fair market value (subject to regulated discounts) of such common shares on the date of grant, and the maximum term of each stock option may not exceed ten years and are determined in accordance with Toronto Stock Exchange ( TSX ) guidelines. 
   
 No options were granted during fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2016, and as of August 31, 2016 there were no options outstanding. 
   
   401(k) Plan   
   
 The Company has a 401(k) Plan which allows for a non-elective discretionary contribution based on the first $60,000 of eligible compensation. In fiscal 2016, the Company made an additional 10% contribution for all eligible employees as a one-time compensation bonus. For the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 the 401(k) compensation expense was $571,551 and $242,960, respectively.  The contributions for Donald Boone were $6,207 and $5,040 for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  The contributions for Michael Nasser were $15,000 and $8,400 for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  The contribution for Murray Smith was $Nil and $8,400 for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  There are no un-funded liabilities. 
   
   Long-Term Incentive Plan / Defined Benefit or Actuarial Plan   
   
 During fiscal 2016 the Company had no Long-Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ) and no LTIP awards were made.  Also, during fiscal 2016 the Company had no Defined Benefit or Actuarial Plan. 
   
   Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation   
   
 The Company has no compensation committee, and the independent members of the board of directors perform equivalent functions.   
   
 No board of director member and none of our executive officers have a relationship that would constitute an interlocking relationship with executive officers and directors of another entity.

   Director Compensation   
   
 The Company has no formal plan for compensating its directors for their service in their capacity as directors.  Directors are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors.  The board of directors may award special remuneration to any director undertaking any special services on behalf of the Company other than services ordinarily required of a director.  During fiscal 2016 the following cash payments were paid to directors to compensate them for board meetings attended:  Frank Magdlen $4,200 (fiscal 2015 - $3,400), Ralph Lodewick $4,200 (fiscal 2015 - $4,200), Adrian Russell-Falla $1,800 (fiscal 2015 - $Nil), and Ted Sharp $Nil (fiscal 2015 - $4,600). Ted Sharp died on March 20, 2015, and Adrian Russell-Falla was named to the Board effective May 11, 2015. 

Executive Officer Compensation   
   
 The Company has no compensation committee and a majority of the board of directors performs equivalent functions. 
   
 As in prior years all judgments regarding executive compensation for fiscal 2016 were based primarily upon our assessment of each executive officer s performance and contribution towards enhancing long-term shareowner value.  We rely upon judgment and not upon rigid guidelines or formulas or short-term changes in our stock price in determining the amount and mix of compensation for each executive officer. 
   
 Decisions concerning 2016 compensation considered each executive officer s level of responsibility and performance.  As noted above, specific decisions involving 2016 executive officer compensation were ultimately based on a judgment about the individual executive officer s performance and contribution towards enhancing long-term shareholder value. 
   
 The board of director s basis for Donald Boone s compensation was set many years ago, and this compensation remained unchanged at his request.  This amount of compensation is substantially less than what would ordinarily be considered as normal compensation for being Chief Executive Officer of the Company. During fiscal 2015, Mr. Boone requested that his compensation be reduced from $36,000 annually to $9.25 per hour, the then current minimum wage in the State of Oregon. The reduction was approved by the Board of Directors and became effective April 1, 2015. 

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS   
   
 The Company is a publicly owned corporation.  It is not controlled directly or indirectly by another corporation or any foreign government. 
   
 Table No. 7 shows directors, executive officers, and 5% shareholders who beneficially owned the Company s common stock and the amount of the Company s voting stock owned as of November 2, 2016.

 Based on 2,286,294 shares outstanding as of November 2, 2016. 

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE   
   
 There have been no transactions or proposed transactions, which have materially affected or will materially affect the Company in which any director, executive officer, or beneficial holder of more than 5% of the outstanding common stock, or any of their respective relatives, spouses, associates or affiliates has had or will have any direct or material indirect interest. 

ITEM 14.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES   
   
 The audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of auditors; and has the authority and the funding to engage independent counsel and other outside advisors. 
   
 The audit committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the audit committee the authority to grant pre-approvals required by this policy and procedure.  The decisions of any audit committee member to whom authority is delegated to pre-approve a service shall be presented to the audit committee at its next meeting. 
   
 In accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we introduced a procedure for the review and pre-approval of any services performed by Davidson   Company, LLP Chartered Accountants, including audit services, audit related services, tax services and other services.  The procedure requires that all proposed engagements of Davidson   Company, LLP Chartered Accountants for audit and permitted non-audit services are submitted to the finance and audit committee for approval prior to the beginning of any such services.
