Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
  Description of Business 
  AMC Networks Inc. ( AMC Networks ) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the  Company ) own and operate entertainment businesses and assets. The Company is comprised of   two   operating segments: 
             
    National Networks:   Principally includes activities of our programming businesses which include our   five   programming networks distributed in the U.S. and Canada. These programming networks include AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC and SundanceTV in the U.S.; and AMC, IFC, and Sundance Channel in Canada. Our programming businesses within the National Networks segment may also sell rights worldwide to their owned original programming. The National Networks operating segment also includes AMC Networks Broadcasting   Technology, the technical services business, which primarily services most of the programming networks included in the National Networks segment. 
                
    International and Other:   Principally includes AMC Networks International ( AMCNI ), the Company s international programming businesses consisting of a portfolio of channels in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa; IFC Films, the Company s independent film distribution business; AMCNI- DMC, the broadcast solutions unit of certain networks of AMCNI and third-party networks, and various developing on-line content distribution initiatives. 
     Basis of Presentation 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AMC Networks and its majority owned or controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Investments in business entities in which the Company lacks control but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  
  Unaudited Interim Financial Statements 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K (   2015   Form 10-K ) filed with the SEC. The condensed consolidated financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, such financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.  
  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  Program Rights 
  The Company periodically reviews the programming usefulness of its licensed and owned original program rights based on a series of factors, including expected future revenue generation from airings on the Company s networks and other exploitation opportunities, ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition through various forms of distribution. If it is determined that film or other program rights have no future programming usefulness, a write-off of the unamortized cost is recorded in technical and operating expense. Program rights write-offs included in technical and operating expense of   $19,596   and   $13,199   were recorded for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Program rights write-offs included in technical and operating expense of   $20,676   and   $26,800   were recorded for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, the useful lives and methodologies used to amortize and assess recoverability of program

rights, the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, valuation and recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets and income tax assets and liabilities. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications were made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The guidance clarifies the way in which certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified on the statement of cash flows and also how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the first quarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of related matters in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to record most of their leases on the balance sheet, which will be recognized as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The Company will be required to classify each separate lease component as an operating or finance lease at the lease commencement date. Initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability is the same for operating and finance leases, however expense recognition and amortization of the right-of-use asset differs. Operating leases will reflect lease expense on a straight-line basis similar to current operating leases. The straight-line expense will reflect the interest expense on the lease liability (effective interest method) and amortization of the right-of-use asset, which will be presented as a single line item in the operating expense section of the income statement. Finance leases will reflect a front-loaded expense pattern similar to the pattern for current capital leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently determining its implementation approach and assessing the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740) Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for the first quarter of 2017 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . ASU 2014-09 provides new guidance related to how an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard requires an evaluation of (i) transfer of control, (ii) variable consideration, (iii) allocation of selling price for multiple elements, (iv) intellectual property licenses, (v) time value of money, and (vi) contract costs. The standard also expands the required disclosures related to revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers to provide greater insight into both revenue that has been recognized, and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations  , which provides clarification on the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations outlined in ASU No. 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which finalized amendments to identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 are effective for the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted and retrospective application required. The Company is currently determining its implementation approach and assessing the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2. Net Income per Share 
  The following is a reconciliation between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding:   

  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were no restricted stock units that would have been anti-dilutive to the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Approximately   137,000   and   125,000   restricted stock units for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, have been excluded from diluted weighted average common shares outstanding since a performance condition on these awards was not met in each of the respective periods. 
  Stock Repurchase Program 
  On March 4, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to   $500,000   of its outstanding shares of common stock (the  2016 Stock Repurchase Program ). For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   1,138,196   shares of its Class A common stock at an average purchase price of approximately   $54.27   per share. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   1,949,581   shares of its Class A common stock at an average purchase price of approximately   $56.42   per share. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has   $390,003   available for repurchase under the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program. 
   
  Note 3. Restructuring 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company launched a restructuring initiative that involved modifications to the organizational structure of the Company and is expected to result in reduced employee costs and operating expenses primarily through a voluntary buyout program offered to certain employees. Additional charges relating to this restructuring initiative may be incurred in future periods. 
  The Company incurred restructuring expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily related to severance charges associated with the elimination of certain positions across the Company and the termination of distribution in certain territories.  
  The following table summarizes the restructuring expense recognized by operating segment:

The following table summarizes the accrued restructuring costs: 

Liabilities for restructuring costs are included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  The carrying amount of goodwill, by operating segment is as follows: 

Purchase accounting adjustments included in the International and Other segment relate to the allocation of fair value for a previous acquisition of a small international channel from goodwill primarily to identifiable intangible assets. 
  The reduction of   $1,909   in the carrying amount of goodwill for the National Networks is due to the realization of a tax benefit for the amortization of  second component  goodwill at SundanceTV. Second component goodwill is the amount of tax deductible goodwill in excess of goodwill for financial reporting purposes. In accordance with the authoritative guidance at the time of the SundanceTV acquisition, the tax benefits associated with this excess are applied to first reduce the amount of goodwill, and then other intangible assets for financial reporting purposes, if and when such tax benefits are realized in the Company s tax returns.

Note 6. Long-term Debt 
  The Company s long-term debt consists of the following: 

(a) 
    The Company s   $500,000   revolving credit facility remains undrawn at   September 30, 2016  . Total undrawn revolver commitments are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes of the Company. 
     5.00% Notes due 2024 
  On March 30, 2016, the Company issued   $1,000,000   in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes, net of an issuance discount of   $17,500  , due 2024 (the  5.00% Notes ). AMC Networks used a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to make a cash tender ( Tender Offer ) for its outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "7.75% Notes") with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption of any of the 7.75% Notes not tendered. The 5.00% Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 30, 2016 (the  5.00% Notes Indenture ). 
  In connection with the issuance of the 5.00% Notes, AMC Networks incurred deferred financing costs of   $2,070  , which are being amortized, using the effective interest method, to interest expense over the term of the 5.00% Notes. 
  Interest on the 5.00% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. 
  The 5.00% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time on or after April 1, 2020, at a redemption price equal to   102.5%   of the principal amount thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of such redemption), declining annually to   100%   of the principal amount thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of such redemption) beginning on April 1, 2022. 
  The 5.00% Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of AMC Networks  existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, in accordance with the 5.00% Notes Indenture. The guarantees under the 5.00% Notes are full and unconditional and joint and several.  
  The 5.00% Notes Indenture contains certain affirmative and negative covenants applicable to AMC Networks and its restricted subsidiaries including restrictions on their ability to incur additional indebtedness, consummate certain assets sales, make investments in entities that are not restricted subsidiaries, create liens on their assets, enter into certain affiliate transactions and make certain restricted payments, including restrictions on AMC Networks  ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, its common stock. 
  7.75% Notes due 2021 
  In March 2016, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the 5.00% Notes to make a Tender Offer for the 7.75% Notes at a price of   $1,058.57   per   $1,000   principal amount of notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Pursuant to the Tender Offer, the Company purchased approximately   $654,000   principal amount of the 7.75% Notes for a purchase price of approximately   $703,000   including accrued and unpaid interest of   $10,567   and related fees. On June 9, 2016, the Company gave notice to the remaining holders of its 7.75% Notes of its intent to redeem all outstanding 7.75% Notes on July 15, 2016, (the  Redemption Date ) and on July 15, 2016, the Company redeemed the remaining   $45,551   of the 7.75% notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to   103.875%   of the principal amount thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date). As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the 7.75% Notes remain outstanding.

In connection with the Tender Offer in March 2016 and subsequent redemption of the remaining 7.75% Notes in July 2016, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $50,638   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which includes   $40,953   related to the excess of the redemption price, premium paid and related fees, and the write-off of unamortized issuance discount and deferred financing fees related to the 7.75% Notes of   $8,715   and   $970  , respectively. 
   
  Note 7. Fair Value Measurement 
  The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity s pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels: 
             
    Level I - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
                
    Level II - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
                
    Level III - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable. 
     The following table presents for each of these hierarchy levels, the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Company s cash equivalents are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. 
  The Company s interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency derivatives (see Note   8  ) are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and their fair values are determined based on a market approach valuation technique that uses readily observable market parameters and the consideration of counterparty risk. 
  The Company does not have any recurring assets or liabilities measured at fair value that would be considered Level III. 
  Fair value measurements are also used in nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with acquisition accounting. These nonrecurring valuations primarily include the valuation of affiliate and customer relationships intangible assets, advertiser relationship intangible assets and property and equipment. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level III of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Credit Facility Debt and Senior Notes 
  The fair values of each of the Company s debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities.

The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments, excluding those that are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, are summarized as follows: 

Fair value estimates related to the Company s debt instruments presented above are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
   
  Note   8  . Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  To manage interest rate risk, the Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the amount of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had interest rate swap contracts outstanding with notional amounts aggregating   $300,000  , which consists of interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of   $200,000   that are designated as cash flow hedges and interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of   $100,000   that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company s outstanding interest rate swap contracts have varying maturities ranging from July 2017 to October 2018. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges were highly effective.

Note 9. Income Taxes 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , income tax expense was   $21,157   and   $119,090  , respectively, representing an effective tax rate of   24%   and   31%  , respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to state and local income tax expense of   $788   and   $6,123  , tax benefit of   $3,443   and   $12,364   from foreign subsidiary earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., tax benefit of   $6,651   and   $3,939   relating to uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest), tax benefit from the domestic production activities deduction of   $2,784   and   $12,519   and tax expense of   $2,320   and   $7,021   resulting from an increase in the valuation allowances for foreign and local taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The tax benefit relating to a reduction in uncertain tax positions is primarily due to a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , income tax expense was   $43,358   and   $155,609  , respectively, representing an effective tax rate of   36%   and   35%  , respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to state and local income tax expense of   $2,775   and   $9,335  , tax benefit of   $409   and   $6,610   from foreign subsidiary earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., tax benefit from the domestic production activities deduction of   $4,332   and   $14,515   and tax expense of   $3,261   and   $10,049   resulting from an increase in the valuation allowances for foreign and local taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had foreign tax credit carry forwards of approximately   $42,000  , expiring on various dates from 2016 through 2026. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , excess tax benefits of   $764   relating to share-based compensation awards and   $1,207   relating to amortization of tax deductible second component goodwill were realized as a reduction in tax liability (as determined on a  with-and-without  approach). 
   
  Note   10  . Commitments and Contingencies 
  Commitments 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s contractual obligations not reflected on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet   decreased     $168,458   to   $1,347,605   as compared to   $1,516,063   at   December 31, 2015  .

  Legal Matters 
  On December 17, 2013, Frank Darabont ( Darabont ), Ferenc, Inc., Darkwoods Productions, Inc., and Creative Artists Agency, LLC (together,  Plaintiffs ), filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court in connection with Darabont s rendering services as a writer, director and producer of the television series entitled   The Walking Dead   and the agreement between the parties related thereto. The Plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, for an accounting and for declaratory relief. On August 19, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (the  Amended Complaint ), in which they retracted their claims for wrongful termination and failure to apply production tax credits in calculating Plaintiffs  contingent compensation. Plaintiffs also added a claim that Darabont is entitled to a larger share, on a percentage basis, of contingent compensation than he is currently being accorded. On September 26, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their note of issue and certificate of readiness for trial, indicating that the parties have completed fact and expert discovery. The parties are now briefing summary judgment motions, which papers, according to a stipulated schedule, will be fully submitted to the Court in early January

2017. The Company has opposed the claims in the Complaint, the Amended Complaint and all subsequent complaints. The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit, denies the allegations and continues to defend the case vigorously. At this time, no determination can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this litigation or the potential liability, if any, on the part of the Company. 
  The Company is party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business, including the matter described above. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and while the impact of these matters on the Company s results of operations in any particular subsequent reporting period could be material, management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due. 
   
  Note 11. Equity Plans 
  On June 8, 2016, AMC Networks granted   27,066   restricted stock units ( RSUs ) under the AMC Networks Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Non-Employee Directors Plan to non-employee directors that vested on the date of grant. 
  On March 4, 2016, AMC Networks granted   486,758   RSUs and   371,109   performance restricted stock units ( PRSUs ) to certain executive officers and employees under the AMC Networks Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Employee Stock Plan. PRSUs were first granted in March 2016 to replace the Company s long-term cash performance awards. The RSUs vest in equal annual installments over a   three  -year period and the vesting criteria for   137,527   RSUs include the achievement of certain performance targets by the Company. The PRSUs vest on the   third   anniversary of the grant date and include the achievement of certain performance targets by the Company. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   336,435   RSUs of AMC Networks Class A Common Stock previously issued to employees of the Company vested. On the vesting dates,   139,904   RSUs were surrendered to the Company to cover the required statutory tax withholding obligations and   196,531   new shares of the AMC Networks Class A Common Stock were issued in respect of the remaining vesting RSUs. The units surrendered to satisfy the employees  statutory minimum tax withholding obligations for the applicable income and other employment tax had an aggregate value of   $10,821  , which is reflected as a financing activity in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Share-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expense, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $9,382   and   $28,869  , respectively, and   $7,821   and   $23,910   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $58,992   of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to outstanding unvested share-based awards. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of approximately   2.5   years. 
   
  Note 12. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
  In connection with a membership interest purchase agreement entered into with BBC Worldwide Americas, Inc. ( BBCWA ),  the Company acquired a   49.9%   limited liability interest in New Video Channel America L.L.C. ( New Video ). New Video owns the cable channel BBC AMERICA. The terms of the agreement provide BBCWA with a right to put all of its   50.1%   noncontrolling interest to the Company at the greater of the then fair value or the fair value of the initial equity interest at inception. The put option is exercisable on the   fifteenth   and   twenty-fifth   year anniversary of the Joint Venture agreement.  
  In connection with the creation of another joint venture entity in 2013, the terms of the agreement provide the noncontrolling member with a right to put all of its interest to the Company at the then fair value. 
  Because exercise of these put rights is outside the Company's control, the noncontrolling interest in each entity is presented as redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of stockholders' equity (deficiency) on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Note 13. Related Party Transactions  
  Members of the Dolan Family, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including trusts for the benefit of the Dolan Family, collectively beneficially own   all   of the AMC Networks outstanding Class B Common Stock and own less than   2%   of the AMC Networks  outstanding Class A Common Stock. Such shares of the AMC Networks Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, collectively, represent approximately   67%   of the aggregate voting power of AMC Networks  outstanding common stock. Members of the Dolan Family are also the controlling stockholders of The Madison Square Garden Company ( MSG ) and MSG Networks Inc. ( MSG Networks ). Prior to June 21, 2016, members of the Dolan Family were also the controlling stockholders of Cablevision Systems Corporation ( Cablevision ) 
  On June 21, 2016, Cablevision was acquired by a subsidiary of Altice N.V. and a change in control occurred which resulted in members of the Dolan Family no longer being controlling stockholders of the surviving company, Altice USA. Accordingly, Altice USA is not a related party of AMC Networks.  
  The Company and its related parties routinely enter into transactions with each other in the ordinary course of business. Revenues, net from related parties amounted to   $1,450   and   $6,407   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $14,356   and   $19,619   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Amounts charged to the Company, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, pursuant to transactions with its related parties amounted to   $647   and   $972   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $2,537   and   $3,190   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  On June 16, 2016, AMC Networks entered into an arrangement with the Dolan Family Office, LLC ( DFO ), MSG and MSG Networks providing for the sharing of certain expenses associated with executive office space which will be available to Charles F. Dolan (the Executive Chairman and a director of the Company and a director of MSG and MSG Networks), James L. Dolan (the Executive Chairman and a director of MSG and MSG Networks and a director of the Company), and the DFO which is controlled by Charles F. Dolan. The Company s share of initial set-up costs and office expenses is not material.

  Note 16. Segment Information 
  The Company classifies its operations into   two   operating segments: National Networks and International and Other. These operating segments represent strategic business units that are managed separately. 
  The Company generally allocates all corporate overhead costs to the Company s   two   operating segments based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services, including such costs as executive salaries and benefits, costs of maintaining corporate headquarters, facilities and common support functions (such as human resources, legal, finance, tax, accounting, audit, treasury, risk management, strategic planning and information technology) as well as sales support functions and creative and production services. 
  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating segment adjusted operating income (a non-GAAP measure) defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense or benefit, and restructuring expense or credit). We renamed this non-GAAP performance measure to adjusted operating income ( AOI ), formerly referred to as adjusted operating cash flow ( AOCF ). Other than the title, there is no change to the definition of this non-GAAP measure. 
  The Company has presented the components that reconcile adjusted operating income to operating income, an accepted GAAP measure, and other information as to the continuing operations of the Company s operating segments below.

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  . This section provides an update, if any, to our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since   December 31, 2015  .  
   
  Business Overview 
  We manage our business through the following   two   operating segments: 
             
    National Networks:   Principally includes activities of our programming businesses which include our   five   programming networks distributed in the U.S. and Canada. These programming networks include AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC and SundanceTV in the U.S.; and AMC, IFC, and Sundance Channel in Canada. Our programming businesses within the National Networks segment may also sell rights worldwide to their owned original programming. The National Networks operating segment also includes AMC Networks Broadcasting   Technology, the technical services business, which primarily services most of the programming networks included in the National Networks segment. 
                
    International and Other:   Principally includes AMC Networks International ( AMCNI ), the Company s international programming businesses consisting of a portfolio of channels in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa; IFC Films, the Company s independent film distribution business; AMCNI - DMC, the broadcast solutions unit of certain networks of AMCNI and third-party networks, and various developing on-line content distribution initiatives.

Financial Results Overview  
  The tables presented below set forth our consolidated revenues, net, operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income ( AOI ), defined below, for the periods indicated. 

We evaluate segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating segment AOI. We define AOI, which is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense or benefit, and restructuring expense or credit. We renamed this non-GAAP performance measure to adjusted operating income ( AOI ), formerly referred to as adjusted operating cash flow ( AOCF ). Other than the title, there is no change to the definition of this non-GAAP measure. 
  We believe that AOI is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance on both an operating segment and consolidated basis. AOI and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in the industry. 
  Internally, we use revenues, net and AOI measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. AOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Since AOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. 
  The following is a reconciliation of consolidated operating income to AOI for the periods indicated: 

National Networks 
  In our National Networks segment, which accounted for   84%   of our consolidated revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we earn revenue principally from the distribution of our programming and the sale of advertising. Distribution  
  
   30 

revenue primarily includes affiliation fees paid by distributors to carry our programming networks and the licensing of original programming for digital, foreign and home video distribution. Affiliation fees paid by distributors represent the largest component of distribution revenue. Our affiliation fee revenues are generally based on a per subscriber fee under multi-year contracts, commonly referred to as  affiliation agreements,  which generally provide for rate increases. The specific affiliation fee revenues we earn vary from period to period, distributor to distributor and also vary among our networks, but are generally based upon the number of each distributor s subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers. The terms of certain other affiliation agreements provide that the affiliation fee revenues we earn are a fixed contractual monthly fee, which could be adjusted for acquisitions and dispositions of multichannel video programming systems by the distributor. Revenue from the licensing of original programming for digital and foreign distribution is recognized upon availability or distribution by the licensee. 
  Under affiliation agreements with our distributors, we have the right to sell a specified amount of national advertising time on our programming networks. Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliation fee revenues because the majority of our advertising is sold on a short-term basis, not under long-term contracts. Our advertising arrangements with advertisers provide for a set number of advertising units to air over a specific period of time at a negotiated price per unit for which our programming networks generally guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming.  
  Our principal goal is to increase our revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our services, and increasing our ratings. To do this, we must continue to contract for and produce high-quality, attractive programming. As competition for programming increases and alternative distribution technologies continue to emerge and develop in the industry, costs for content acquisition and original programming may increase. There is a concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few distributors, which could create disparate bargaining power between the largest distributors and us by giving those distributors greater leverage in negotiating the price and other terms of affiliation agreements. 
  Programming expense, included in technical and operating expense, represents the largest expense of the National Networks segment and primarily consists of amortization and impairments or write-offs of programming rights, such as those for original programming, feature films and licensed series, as well as participation and residual costs. The other components of technical and operating expense primarily include distribution and production related costs and program operating costs, such as origination, transmission, uplinking and encryption. 
  The success of our business depends on original programming, both scripted and unscripted, across all of our networks. In recent years, we have introduced a number of scripted original series. These series generally result in higher audience ratings for our networks than we achieve with other types of programming. Among other things, higher audience ratings drive increased revenues through higher advertising revenues. The timing of exhibition and distribution of original programming varies from period to period, which results in greater variability in our revenues, earnings and cash flows from operating activities. We will continue to increase our investment in programming across all of our channels. There may be significant changes in the level of our technical and operating expenses due to the amortization of content acquisition and/or original programming costs and/or the impact of management s periodic assessment of programming usefulness. Such costs will also fluctuate with the level of revenues derived from owned original programming in each period as these costs are amortized based on the film-forecast-computation method. 
   Most original series require us to make up-front investments, which are often significant amounts. Not all of our programming efforts are commercially successful, which could result in a write-off of program rights. If it is determined that programming rights have no future programming usefulness based on actual demand or market conditions, a write-off of the unamortized cost is recorded in technical and operating expense. Program rights write-offs of   $19,350   and   $12,087   were recorded for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Program rights write-offs of   $20,430   and   $25,667   were recorded for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  International and Other 
  Our International and Other segment primarily includes the operations of AMC Networks International and IFC Films.  
  In our International and Other segment, which accounted for 16% of our consolidated revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we earn revenue principally from the international distribution of programming and to a lesser extent, the sale of advertising. Distribution revenue primarily includes affiliation fees paid by distributors to carry our programming networks. Our affiliation fee revenues are generally based on either a per subscriber fee or a fixed contractual monthly fee, under affiliation agreements, which may provide for annual rate increases. Most of these revenues are derived primarily from Europe and to a lesser extent, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa. The International and Other segment also includes IFC Films, our independent film distribution business where revenues are derived principally from theatrical, digital and licensing distribution, and various developing on-line content distribution initiatives. 
  Programming and program operating costs, included in technical and operating expense, represents the largest expense of the International and Other segment and primarily consists of amortization of acquired content, costs of dubbing and sub-titling  
  
   31 

of programs and participation costs. Program operating costs include costs such as origination, transmission, uplinking and encryption.   
  We view our international expansion as an important long-term strategy. We may experience an adverse impact to the International and Other segment s operating results and cash flows in periods of increased international investment by the Company. Similar to our domestic businesses, the most significant business challenges we expect to encounter in our international business include programming competition (from both foreign and domestic programmers), limited channel capacity on distributors  platforms, the change in the number of subscribers on those platforms and economic pressures on affiliation fees. Other significant business challenges unique to our international operations include increased programming costs for international rights and translation (  i.e.   dubbing and subtitling), a lack of availability of international rights for a portion of our domestic programming content, increased distribution costs for cable, satellite or fiber feeds and a limited physical presence in some territories, and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. See also the risk factors described under Item 1A,  Risk Factors - We face risks from doing business internationally  in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Corporate Expenses 
  We allocate corporate overhead to each segment based upon its proportionate estimated usage of services. The segment financial information set forth below, including the discussion related to individual line items, does not reflect inter-segment eliminations unless specifically indicated. 
  Impact of Economic Conditions 
  Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions including the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. 
  Capital and credit market disruptions could cause economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as lower demand for television advertising and a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming networks from our distributors. Additionally, as noted above, we may experience an adverse impact due to the impact of global economic conditions and the related effect on foreign currencies. Events such as these may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Revenues, net 
  Revenues, net increased   $2,481   to   $634,646   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks 
  The increase in National Networks revenues, net was attributable to the following: 

The decrease of   $20,894   in advertising revenues was driven primarily by a decrease at AMC due to lower  ratings. Most of our advertising revenues vary based on the timing of our original programming series and the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. Due to these factors, we expect advertising revenues to vary from quarter to quarter.  
                
    Distribution revenues increased   $24,967   driven by an increase of $20,150 primarily from licensing revenues derived from our original programming, principally at AMC. In addition, affiliation fee revenues increased due to rate increases, principally at AMC. Distribution revenues vary based on the impact of renewals of affiliation agreements and the timing of availability of our programming to distributors. Because of these factors, we expect distribution revenues to vary from quarter to quarter. 
     International and Other 
  The decrease in International and Other revenues, net was attributable to the following: 

The increase in advertising revenues was principally due to increased demand for programming at AMCNI by advertisers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $2,700. The decrease in distribution revenues principally resulted from a decrease at IFC Films of $3,055 due to the strong performance of   Boyhood   in 2015, partially offset by an increase of $1,512 at AMCNI due to expanded distribution in certain territories and an increase of $725 from our developing on-line content distribution business. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation at AMCNI on distribution revenue was approximately $2,500. 
  Technical and operating expense (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
  The components of technical and operating expense primarily include the amortization and impairments or write-offs of program rights, such as those for original programming, feature films and licensed series, participation and residual costs, distribution and production related costs and program operating costs, such as origination, transmission, uplinking and encryption. 
  
   35 

Technical and operating expense (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased   $45,703   to   $338,799   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks 
  The increase in the National Networks segment was attributable to an increase of $52,643 in program rights amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease of $8,594 for other direct programming related costs. The increase in program rights amortization expense was due to an increased investment in original programming. Program rights amortization expense included write-offs of $19,350 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   based on management s assessment of programming usefulness of certain scripted series primarily at AMC and BBC AMERICA. Program rights amortization expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   included write-offs of   $12,087   of certain scripted series at SundanceTV and an unscripted series at WE tv based on management s assessment of programming usefulness.  
  International and Other 
  The increase in the International and Other segment was primarily due to an increase of $3,022 in programming rights amortization expense at AMCNI due to an increased investment in original programming, offset by a decrease of $2,412 at IFC Films from lower participation and residuals expense related to the success of   Boyhood   in 2015. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in technical and operating expense of approximately $3,500. 
  Selling, general and administrative expense 
  The components of selling, general and administrative expense primarily include sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of facilities. 
  Selling, general and administrative expense decreased   $19,192   to   $137,116   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks 
  The decrease of $14,732 in selling, general and administrative expense in the National Networks segment was driven by a decrease in marketing expenses of $6,655 related to the timing of promotion of original programming, a decrease in direct sales related expense of $3,049 and a net decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense of $6,973. 
  There may be significant changes in the level of our selling, general and administrative expense from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing of promotion and marketing of original programming series and subscriber retention marketing efforts. 
  International and Other     
  The decrease of $4,468 in selling, general and administrative expense in the International and Other segment was primarily driven by a decrease of $2,437 at AMCNI and $2,057 at IFC Films. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense decreased due to a net decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense of $1,541. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in selling, general and administrative expense of approximately $2,600. 
  
   36 

Restructuring expense  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company launched a restructuring initiative that involved modifications to the organizational structure of the Company and is expected to result in reduced employee costs and operating expenses primarily through a voluntary buyout program offered to certain employees. Additional charges relating to this restructuring initiative may be incurred in future periods. 
  Restructuring expense was $19,312 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, of which $8,103 and $11,209 was incurred at the National Networks segment and the International and Other segment, which includes corporate headquarters, respectively. Restructuring expense represents severance charges incurred related to employee terminations primarily associated with the voluntary buyout program. 
  The restructuring expense of $2,631 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily incurred at the International and Other segment related to the elimination of distribution in certain territories and severance charges incurred related to the elimination of certain positions. 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $1,420   to   $22,282   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense at both the National Networks and International and Other segments was attributable to an increase in depreciation expense of $2,538 related to property and equipment additions, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense at International and Other due to the write-off in 2015 of certain identifiable intangible assets associated with certain channel closures. 
  AOI 
  The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated operating income to AOI: 

AOI decreased   $22,469   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks AOI decreased as a result of higher technical and operating expenses of   $44,049   resulting primarily from an increase in amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of $15,905 and an increase in revenue of $4,073. As a result of the factors discussed above impacting the variability in revenues and operating expenses, we expect AOI to vary from quarter to quarter. 
  
   37 

International and Other AOI increased $4,204 principally due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of $4,856. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact to the change in AOI of approximately $800. 
  Loss on extinguishment of debt 
  The loss on extinguishment of debt for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   of $2,295 represents fees incurred in connection with the redemption of the remaining $45,551 of the 7.75% Notes outstanding on July 15, 2016. This includes $1,765 related to the excess of the redemption price, premium paid and related fees, as well as unamortized issuance discount related to the 7.75% Notes of $530. See further discussion under the heading  Debt Financing Agreements  below. 
  Miscellaneous, net 
  The decrease in miscellaneous, net of   $10,628   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   is primarily the result of net foreign currency transaction gains of $2,621 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net foreign currency transaction losses of $10,575 in the prior comparable period. These net foreign currency gains and losses are principally the result of the translation of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable entity, primarily due to intercompany loans. In addition, gains on derivative contracts decreased $1,435 as compared to the prior comparable period.  
  Income tax expense 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense was $21,157 representing an effective tax rate of 24%. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state and local income tax expense of $788, tax benefit of $3,443 from foreign subsidiary earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., tax benefit of $6,651 relating to uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest), tax benefit from the domestic production activities deduction of $2,784 and tax expense of $2,320 resulting from an increase in the valuation allowances for foreign and local taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The tax benefit relating to a reduction in uncertain tax positions is primarily due to a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations. 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, income tax expense was $43,358 representing an effective tax rate of 36%. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state and local income tax expense of $2,775, tax benefit of $409 from foreign subsidiary earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., tax benefit from the domestic production activities deduction of $4,332 and tax expense of $3,261 resulting from an increase in the valuation allowances for foreign and local taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Revenues, net 
  Revenues, net increased   $124,072   to   $2,026,057   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks 
  The increase in National Networks revenues, net was attributable to the following: 

The increase of   $36,138   in advertising revenues was driven by an increase across substantially all of our national networks due to increased demand by advertisers and higher pricing driven by original programming series and series premieres. Most of our advertising revenues vary based on the timing of our original programming series and the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. Due to these factors, we expect advertising revenues to vary from quarter to quarter.  
                
    Distribution revenues increased   $87,748   due to an increase of $62,133 principally from licensing and digital distribution revenues derived from our original programming, principally at AMC. In addition, affiliation fee revenues increased due to rate increases, primarily at AMC, as compared to the same period in 2015. Distribution revenues vary based on the impact of renewals of affiliation agreements and the timing of availability of our programming to distributors. Because of these factors, we expect distribution revenues to vary from quarter to quarter. 
     International and Other 
  The increase in International and Other revenues, net was attributable to the following: 

The increase in advertising revenues was principally due to inclusion of revenues from an acquisition at the end of 2015 as well as increased demand for our programming at AMCNI by advertisers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $5,000. The decrease in distribution revenues was primarily driven by a decrease at IFC Films of $8,363 due to the strong performance of   Boyhood   in 2015, partially offset by the increase at AMCNI of $5,939 due to expanded distribution and an increase of $1,878 from our developing on-line content distribution business. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation at AMCNI on distribution revenue was approximately $7,700.  
  Technical and operating expense (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
  The components of technical and operating expense primarily include the amortization and impairments or write-offs of program rights, such as those for original programming, feature films and licensed series, participation and residual costs, distribution and production related costs and program operating costs, such as origination, transmission, uplinking and encryption. 
  
   41 

Technical and operating expense (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased   $100,337   to   $915,336   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks 
  The increase in the National Networks segment was attributable to an increase of $79,654 in program rights amortization expense and an increase of $21,539 for other direct programming related costs. The increase in program rights amortization expense is due to an increased investment in original programming. Program rights amortization expense included write-offs of $20,430 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   based on management s assessment of programming usefulness of certain scripted series primarily at AMC and BBC AMERICA. Program rights amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included write-offs of   $25,667   of certain scripted series at SundanceTV, unscripted series WE tv and pilot costs at AMC based on management s assessment of programming usefulness.  
  There may be significant changes in the level of our technical and operating expenses due to content acquisition and/or original programming costs and/or the impact of management s periodic assessment of programming usefulness. Such costs will also fluctuate with the level of revenues derived from owned original programming in each period as these costs are amortized based on the film-forecast-computation method. As additional competition for programming increases and alternate distribution technologies continue to develop in the industry, costs for content acquisition and original programming may increase. 
  International and Other 
  The increase in the International and Other segment was primarily due to an increase of $7,617 at AMCNI in program rights amortization expense due the increased investment in original programming, partially offset by a decrease in other direct programming related costs of $2,678 at AMCNI. The International and Other segment also included an increase of $1,842 related to increased investment at our on-line content distribution business, offset by a decrease of $5,485 at IFC Films principally driven by a decrease in participation and residuals expense related to the success of   Boyhood   in 2015. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in technical and operating expense of approximately $7,800. 
  Selling, general and administrative expense 
  The components of selling, general and administrative expense primarily include sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of facilities. 
  Selling, general and administrative expense increased   $3,993   to   $473,760   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks 
  Selling, general and administrative expense in the National Networks segment remained relatively unchanged as increases in advertising sales and marketing expenses of $7,105 were offset by a net decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense of $8,135. 
  
   42 

There may be significant changes in the level of our selling, general and administrative expense from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing of promotion and marketing of original programming series and subscriber retention marketing efforts. 
  International and Other     
  Selling, general and administrative expense in the International and Other segment increased due to increases at AMCNI of $10,686 principally related to employee and employee related costs of $4,113, advertising costs of $1,995 and rent expense of $1,524, an increase of $5,324 at our on-line content distribution business principally due to increased subscriber acquisition costs.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease at IFC Films of $9,892 due to increased marketing expense due to the promotion of certain films in 2015 and a net decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense of $2,082. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in selling, general and administrative expense of approximately $5,400. 
  Restructuring expense  
  Restructuring expense of $19,666 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to $8,170 in the National Networks segment and $11,496 in the International and Other segment, which includes corporate headquarters related charges. The Company launched a restructuring initiative that involved modifications to the organizational structure of the Company and is expected to result in reduced employee costs and operating expenses primarily through a voluntary buyout program offered to certain employees.  Additional charges relating to this restructuring initiative may be incurred in future periods. 
  Restructuring expense of $5,941 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to $817 in the National Networks segment and $5,124 in the International and Other segment, which includes corporate headquarters related charges. Restructuring expense in the National Networks segment primarily represented severance charges incurred related to employee terminations associated with the elimination of certain positions. Restructuring expense at the International and Other segment represented  costs related to the termination of distribution in certain territories and severance charges incurred related the elimination of certain positions across the Company. 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $1,038   to   $63,467   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in the National Networks segment was primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation expense due to property and equipment additions. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the International and Other segment was primarily attributable due to a decrease in amortization of $3,165 resulting from the write-off recorded in 2015 of certain identifiable intangible assets associated with certain channel closures, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $2,052 due to property and equipment additions.  
  AOI 
  The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated operating income to AOI: 

43 

AOI increased   $24,701   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net change by segment was as follows: 

National Networks AOI increased principally due to an increase in revenues, net of   $123,886  , partially offset by an increase in technical and operating expenses of   $101,193   resulting from an increase in program rights expense and other direct programming costs. As a result of the factors discussed above impacting the variability in revenues and operating expenses, we expect AOI to vary from quarter to quarter. 
  International and Other AOI increased due to an increase in revenue of   $8,007  , offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $3,722 and an increase in technical and operating expense of   $1,205  .  
  Loss on extinguishment of debt 
  The loss on extinguishment of debt for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $50,638   represents   $40,953   of premium paid and related fees on the early redemption of our 7.75% Notes as well as a write-off of the related unamortized discount of   $8,715   and unamortized deferred financing costs of   $970  . See further discussion under the heading  Debt Financing Agreements  below. 
  Miscellaneous, net 
  The increase in miscellaneous, net of   $16,124   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily the result of a net increase in foreign currency transaction losses of $17,605 from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable entity, primarily intercompany loans, partially offset by an increase in the gains on derivative contracts of $2,276.  
  Income tax expense 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense was $119,090 representing an effective tax rate of 31%. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state and local income tax expense of $6,123, tax benefit of $12,364 from foreign subsidiary earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., tax benefit of $3,939 relating to uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest), tax benefit from the domestic production activities deduction of $12,519 and tax expense of $7,021 resulting from an increase in the valuation allowances for foreign and local taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The tax benefit relating to a reduction in uncertain tax positions is primarily due to a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, income tax expense was $155,609 representing an effective tax rate of 35%. The items resulting in variances from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily consist of state and local income tax expense of $9,335, tax benefit of $6,610 from foreign subsidiary earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., tax benefit from the domestic production activities deduction of $14,515 and tax expense of $10,049 resulting from an increase in the valuation allowances for foreign and local taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our operations have historically generated positive net cash flow from operating activities. However, each of our programming businesses has substantial programming acquisition and production expenditure requirements. 
  Sources of cash primarily include cash flow from operations, amounts available under our revolving credit facility (as described below) and access to capital markets. Although we currently believe that amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be available when and if needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond markets. On March 23, 2016 we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 ( Shelf Registration ) with the SEC in which we registered debt securities. 
  In connection with the Shelf Registration, on March 30, 2016, we issued $1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes, net of an issuance discount of $17,500, due 2024 (the  5.00% Notes ). We used a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to make a cash tender ( Tender Offer ) for our outstanding 7.75% senior notes due 2021 (the  7.75% Notes ) at a price  
  
   44 

of $1,058.57 per $1,000 principal amounts of notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Pursuant to the Tender Offer, we purchased approximately $654,000 principal amount of the 7.75% Notes for a purchase price of approximately $703,000 including accrued and unpaid interest of $10,567 and related fees. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the 7.75% Notes remain outstanding. See  Debt Financing Agreements  below. 
  On March 4, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to   $500,000   of our outstanding shares of common stock (the  2016 Stock Repurchase Program ). Through October 31, 2016, we have repurchased 2,256,138 shares of our Class A common stock for $124,997.  
  Our principal uses of cash include the acquisition and production of programming, investments and acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of outstanding debt and common stock and payments for income taxes. We continue to increase our investment in original programming, the funding of which generally occurs six to nine months in advance of a program s airing. We expect this increased investment to continue in   2016  . The current portion of long term debt is   $203,500   which consists of required principal payments on our Term Loan A facility over the next twelve months. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated cash and cash equivalents includes amounts with a value of approximately   $91,196   held by foreign subsidiaries, some of which have earnings that have not been subject to U.S. tax. Repatriation of earnings not previously subject to U.S. tax would generally require us to accrue and pay U.S. tax on such amount. Our consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently reinvested or repatriated in a tax-free manner. The amount of such undistributed earnings was approximately   $75,000   as of   September 30, 2016  . Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these earnings is not practicable.  
  We believe that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to service the principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, along with our other funding and investment requirements over the next twelve months and over the longer term. However, we do not expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay at maturity the entirety of the then outstanding balances of our debt. As a result, we will then be dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets in order to repay or refinance the outstanding balances of our indebtedness. Failure to raise significant amounts of funding to repay these obligations at maturity would adversely affect our business. In such a circumstance, we would need to take other actions including selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing other discretionary uses of cash. 
  Our level of debt could have important consequences on our business including, but not limited to, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future programming investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. For information relating to our outstanding debt obligations, refer to Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt Financing Agreements  of our   2015   Form 10-K and the discussion below under Debt Financing Agreements. 
  In addition, economic or market disruptions could lead to lower demand for our services, such as lower levels of advertising. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  The revolving credit facility was not drawn upon at   September 30, 2016  . The total undrawn revolver commitment is available to be drawn for our general corporate purposes. 
  AMC Networks was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Cash Flow Discussion 
  The following table is a summary of cash flows provided by (used in) continuing operations and discontinued operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to   $426,592   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $300,973   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily resulted from   $1,085,392   of net income before amortization of program rights, loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash items, which was partially offset by payments for program rights of  
  
   45 

$687,888   and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of   $43,344  . Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities increased due to a decrease in accounts receivable, trade of   $32,747   primarily related to timing of cash receipts and an increase in deferred revenue of   $30,726   primarily related to advertising arrangements and an increase in taxes payable of   $10,414  . 
  Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $300,973 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily resulted from $914,748 of net income before amortization of program rights, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash items, which was partially offset by payments for program rights of $616,047. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities increased due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $26,985 primarily related to timing of cash payments, an increase in taxes payable of $16,107, an increase in deferred revenue of $15,446 primarily related to advertising arrangements and a decrease in accounts receivable, trade of $6,155 primarily related to timing of cash receipts. Decreases to operating cash flows consisted of an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $43,665 primarily related to long-term receivables and payments related to deferred carriage fees, net of $18,825. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $44,859   and   $79,605  , respectively. Capital expenditures were   $44,505   and   $48,810   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , net cash used in investing activities also included the payment for the acquisition of a small international channel, net of cash acquired of   $6,545   and purchases of investments of   $24,250  . 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities amounted to   $2,552   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to    $108,666   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , financing activities primarily consisted of cash provided by the issuance of $1,000,000 of 5.00% Notes, net of an issuance discount of $17,500, offset by principal payments on long term debt of   $811,000   which included the repayment of $700,000 of the Company s 7.75% Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer and the subsequent redemption of the remaining 7.75% Notes on July 15, 2016, as well as scheduled repayments of principal on the Company s Term A loan facility of $111,000. In addition, net cash used in financing activities includes purchases of treasury stock of   $109,997   under our 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, premium payments and fees for the Tender Offer and redemption of the 7.75% Notes of   $40,953  , taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation of   $10,821   and distributions to a noncontrolling member of   $9,010   and principal payments on capital lease obligations of   $3,182  .  
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , financing activities consisted of the repayment of the $40,000 promissory note issued in connection with the acquisition of New Video, principal payments on long-term debt of $55,500, taxes paid in lieu of shares issued for equity-based compensation of $14,454, distributions to a noncontrolling member of $3,154 and principal payments on capital leases of $2,392, partially offset by the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements of$4,297, contributions from noncontrolling interests of $1,354 and proceeds from stock option exercises of $1,183. 
  Debt Financing Agreements 
  5.00% Notes due 2024 
  As noted above, on March 30, 2016, we issued the 5.00% Notes. We used the net proceeds of this offering to fund the Tender Offer of the 7.75% Notes with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption of any of the 7.75% Notes not tendered. The 5.00% Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 30, 2016 (the  5.00% Notes Indenture ). 
  In connection with the issuance of the 5.00% Notes, AMC Networks incurred deferred financing costs of $2,070, which are being amortized, using the effective interest method, to interest expense over the term of the 5.00% Notes. 
  Interest on the 5.00% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. 
  The 5.00% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time on or after April 1, 2020, at a redemption price equal to   102.5%   of the principal amount thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of such redemption), declining annually to 100% of the principal amount thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of such redemption) beginning on April 1, 2022. 
  The 5.00% Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of AMC Networks  existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, in accordance with the 5.00% Notes Indenture. The guarantees under the 5.00% Notes are full and unconditional and joint and several.  
  The 5.00% Notes Indenture contains certain affirmative and negative covenants applicable to AMC Networks and its restricted subsidiaries including restrictions on their ability to incur additional indebtedness, consummate certain assets sales, make investments in entities that are not restricted subsidiaries, create liens on their assets, enter into certain affiliate transactions and make certain restricted payments, including restrictions on AMC Networks  ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, its common stock.

7.75% Notes due 2021 Tender Offer 
  We used a portion of the net proceeds of the 5.00% Notes for the Tender Offer for the 7.75% notes due at a price of $1,058.57 per $1,000 principal amounts of notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Pursuant to the Tender Offer, the Company purchased approximately $654,000 principal amount of the 7.75% Notes for a purchase price of approximately $703,000 including accrued and unpaid interest of $10,567 and related fees.  
  The Company accepted for payment all 7.75% Notes validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date pursuant to the Tender Offer. Such tendering holders received the purchase price in the amount of $1,058.57 for each $1,000 principal amount of 7.75% Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Expiration Date.  
  On June 9, 2016, the Company gave notice to the remaining holders of its 7.75% Notes of its intent to redeem all outstanding 7.75% Notes on July 15, 2016, (the  Redemption Date ) and on July 15, 2016, the Company redeemed the remaining   $45,551   of the 7.75% notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to   103.875%   of the principal amount thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date). As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the 7.75% Notes remain outstanding. 
  In connection with the Tender Offer in March 2016 and subsequent redemption of the remaining 7.75% notes in July 2016, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $50,638   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which includes   $40,953   related to the excess of the redemption price, premium paid and related fees, and the write-off of unamortized issuance discount and deferred financing fees related to the 7.75% Notes of   $8,715   and   $970  , respectively. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our contractual obligations not reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheet   decreased     $168,458   to   $1,347,605   as compared to   $1,516,063   at   December 31, 2015  .   The decrease relates primarily to program rights obligations. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in our   2015   Form 10-K. We discuss our critical accounting estimates in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in the same   2015   Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since December 31,   2015  . 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  See Note 1 to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
   
           Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
     All dollar amounts included in the following discussion under this Item 3 are presented in thousands. 
  Fair Value of Debt 
  Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed rate debt of   $1,619,250   was more than its carrying value of   $1,573,285   by   $45,965  . The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at   September 30, 2016   would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately   $73,128   to approximately   $1,692,378  . 
  Managing our Interest Rate Risk 
  To manage interest rate risk, we enter into interest rate swap contracts from time to time to adjust the amount of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy counterparties. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and to the extent possible diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2,853,918   of debt outstanding (excluding capital leases), of which   $1,280,633   is outstanding under the credit facility and is subject to variable interest rates (before consideration of the interest rate swaps contracts described below). 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had interest rate swap contracts outstanding with notional amounts aggregating   $300,000  . The aggregate fair value of interest rate swap contracts at   September 30, 2016   was a net liability of   $1,130  . As a result of these transactions, the interest rate paid on approximately   66%   of the Company s debt (excluding capital leases) as of   September 30, 2016   is effectively fixed (  55%   being fixed rate obligations and   11%   effectively fixed through utilization of these interest rate swap  
  
   47 

contracts). Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes   $538   of cumulative unrealized losses, net of tax, on the portion of floating-to-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. At   September 30, 2016  , our interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects. 
  A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates prevailing at   September 30, 2016   would not have a material impact on our annual interest expense. 
  Managing our Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries' respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as affiliation agreements, programming contracts, certain trade receivables and accounts payable (including intercompany amounts) that are denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company recognized   $26,571   of foreign currency transaction losses, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Such amount is included in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statement of income. 
  As a result of our international expansion in recent years, we expect the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will have a more significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
  To manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, we may enter into foreign currency contracts from time to time with financial institutions to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. 
  We also are exposed to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our comprehensive income (loss) and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
   
           Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures. 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon that evaluation as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings. 
     On December 17, 2013, Frank Darabont ( Darabont ), Ferenc, Inc., Darkwoods Productions, Inc., and Creative Artists Agency, LLC (together,  Plaintiffs ), filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court in connection with Darabont s rendering services as a writer, director and producer of the television series entitled The Walking Dead and the agreement between the parties related thereto. The Plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, for an accounting and for declaratory relief. On August 19, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (the  Amended Complaint ), in which they retracted their claims for wrongful termination and failure to apply production tax credits in calculating Plaintiffs  contingent compensation. Plaintiffs also added a claim that Darabont is entitled to a larger share, on a percentage basis, of contingent compensation than he is currently being accorded. On September 26, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their note of issue and certificate of readiness for trial, indicating that the parties have completed fact and expert discovery. The parties are now briefing summary judgment motions, which papers, according to a stipulated schedule, will be fully submitted to the Court in early January 2017. The Company has opposed the claims in the Complaint, the Amended Complaint and all subsequent complaints. The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit, denies the allegations and continues to defend the case vigorously. At this time, no determination can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this litigation or the potential liability, if any, on the part of the Company. 
  The Company is party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business, including the matter described above. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and while the impact of these matters on the Company s results of operations in any particular subsequent reporting period could be material, management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due. 
   
           Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
