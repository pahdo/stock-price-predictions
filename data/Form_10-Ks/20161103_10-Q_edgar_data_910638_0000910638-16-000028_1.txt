NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

(  I  n thousands, except per share information  ) 

(1)  Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 3D Systems Corporation and its subsidiaries   (collectively, the  Company ).   All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) applicable to interim reports. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( Form 10-K ).  

In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of adjustments of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.  

Certain prior period amounts presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August   20  16  , the FASB issued Acco  unting Standards Update No. 2016-15  ,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)       Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    ( ASU 2016-15 ). With the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice, ASU 2016-15   addresses eight specific cash flow   classification   issues  : (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies  ,   (6) distributions received from equity method investees, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principal  .    ASU   2016-15   is effective for annual reporting periods b  eginning after December 15, 2017  . The amendments   should be applied retrospectively   with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating th  e impact of adoption of ASU 2016-15   on its financial statements. 

No   other   new accounting pronouncements, issued or effective during the   third quarter   of 2016  , have had or are expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

(6  )  Hedging Activities and Financial Instruments 

The Company conducts business in various countries using both the functional currencies of those countries and other currencies to effect cross border transactions. As a result, the Company is subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the dates that those transactions are entered into and their respective settlement dates will result in a foreign exchange gain or loss. When practicable, the Company endeavors to match assets and liabilities in the same currency on its balance sheet and those of its subsidiaries in order to reduce these risks. When appropriate, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts to hedge exposures arising from those transactions. The Company has elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 815,    Derivatives and Hedging  ,  and therefore, all gains and losses (realized or unrealized) are recognized in  Interest and other expense, net  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Depending on their fair value at the end of the reporting period, derivatives are recorded either in prepaid expenses and other current assets or in accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  

There were   no   foreign currency contracts outstanding as of   September 30  , 2016 or December 31, 2015.       

For the quarter   and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016  , the condensed consolidated st  atements of operations include  s a   foreign currency transaction   loss     of   $1,123   and   a gain of     $  340  , respectively, compared to a gain of   $  126   an  d a loss of   $1,  641     for the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2015  , respectively  . 

For the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016  ,    the total impact of foreign currency translation on accumulated other compre  hensive loss   reflects     gains     of   $4,260   and     $  5,499  , r  espectively, compared to losses   of   $  9,075   and     $  15,315   for the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2015  , respectively.

(7  ) Borrowings  

Credit Facility  

On   October 10, 2014  , the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a   $150,000     five  -year revolving, unsecured credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) with PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, PNC Capital Markets LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and the other lenders party thereto (collectively, the  Lenders ). The Credit Agreement comprises a revolving loan facility that provides for advances in the initial aggregate principal amount of up to $150,000 (the  Credit Facility ).  Subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company may, at its option, request an increase in the aggregate principal amount available under the Credit Facility by an additional   $75,000  .   The Credit Agreement includes provisions for the issuance of letters of credit and swingline loans.  

The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of the Company s material domestic subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ). From time to time, the Company may be required to cause additional material domestic subsidiaries to become Guarantors under the Credit Agreement.   

Generally, amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company s option, at either the Base Rate or the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ), in each case, plus an applicable margin.  Base Rate advances bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the highest of (A) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (B) the Federal Funds Open Rate plus   0.5%   or (C) the Daily LIBOR Rate for a one month interest period plus   1%  , and (ii) an applicable margin that ranges from   0.25%   to   0.50%   based upon the Company s consolidated total leverage ratio. LIBOR Rate advances bear interest at a rate based upon the LIBOR Rate for the applicable interest period, plus an applicable margin that ranges from   1.25%   to   1.50%   based upon the Company s consolidated total leverage ratio. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, (i) accrued interest on each loan bearing interest at the Base Rate is payable quarterly in arrears and (ii) accrued interest on each loan bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate is payable in arrears on the earlier of (A) quarterly and (B) the last day of each applicable interest payment date for each loan. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on   October 10, 2019  , at which time all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable.   

The Company is required to pay certain fees in connection with the Credit Facility, including a quarterly commitment fee equal to the product of the amount of the average daily available revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement multiplied by a percentage that ranges from   0.20%   to   0.25%   depending upon the Company s consolidated total leverage ratio, as well as customary administrative fees.   

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and default provisions for a Credit Facility of this type, including, but not limited to, financial covenants, limitations on liens and the incurrence of debt, covenants to preserve corporate existence and comply with laws and covenants regarding the use of proceeds of the Credit Facility. The financial covenants include a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, which is the ratio of consolidated total funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense), as defined in the Credit Agreement, of   3.00   to 1.00, and a minimum interest coverage ratio, which is the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to cash interest expense, of   3.50   to 1.00.  The Company is only required to be in compliance with the financial covenants as of the end of any fiscal quarter in which there are any loans outstanding at any time during such fiscal quarter. Based on the Company s current results of operations and financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, availability at   September 30  , 2016 would be approximately   $150,000  .   Future results may impact availability.  

The payment of dividends on the Company s common stock is restricted under provisions of the Credit Facility, which limits the amount of cash dividends that the Company may pay in any one fiscal year to   $30,000  . The Company currently does not pay, and has not paid, any dividends on its common stock, and currently intends to retain any future earnings for use in its business.   

There was   no   outstanding balance on the Credit Facility as of   September 30  , 2016 or December 31, 2015  . 

Capitalized Lease Obligations 

The Company s capitalized lease obligations primarily include a lease agreement that was entered into during 2006 with respect to the Company s corporate headquarters located in Rock Hill, SC  . Capitalized lease obligations   decreased   to   $8,362   at   September 30  , 2016   from   $8,716   at December 31, 201  5  , due to the normal scheduled timing of payments. 

(8)  Stock-based Compensation Plans  

Effective May 19, 2004, the Company adopted its 2004 Incentive Stock Plan, as further amended and restated on February 3, 2015 (the  2004 Stock Plan )  ,   and its 2004 Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors  , as further amended and restated on April 1, 2013   (the  Director Plan ). On May 19, 2015, the Company s stockholders approved the 2015 Incentive Plan of 3D Systems Corporation (the  2015 Plan  and, together with the 2004 Stock Plan, the  Incentive Plans ). 

10   

The 2004 Stock Plan authorizes shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and the grant of options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock.  The 2004 Stock Plan also designates measures that may be used for performance awards. 

The Director Plan authorizes shares of restricted stock for non-employee directors of the Company. 

The 2015 Plan authorizes shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, cash incentive awards and the grant of options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. The 2015 Plan also designates measures that may be used for performance awards.   

Generally, awards granted prior to November 13, 2015 become fully-vested on the   three  -year anniversary of the grant date and awards granted   on or   after November 13, 2015 will vest   one     third   each   year   over   three   years.    

The Company records stock-based compensation expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Stock-based compensation expense fo  r the quarters and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

Restricted Stock 

Stock   award     activity   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016     and 2015   was as follows  : 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company   awarded certain   employe  es     restricted stock under the 2015 Pla  n  , included in the activity above,   that vests under specified market conditions. Each employee   was generally awarded   two   equal tranches of   market   condition restricted stock that   immediately   vest  s   when the Company s common stock trades at either   $30   or   $40   per share   for   ninety   consecutive calendar days  .   

At Septe  mber 30, 2016, there was   $5,624   of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to no  n-vested restricted stock awards with market conditions, which the Company expects to recognize   over   the remaining weighted-average vesting period of     four   years.  

At September 30, 2016, there was     $34,859   of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to all other non-vested restricted stock award   shares   and units, which the Company   expects to recognize over the remaining weight  ed-average vesting period of   1.5   years. 

11   

Stock Options 

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options   with market conditions   using a binomial lattice Monte Carlo simulation model. The weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value were as follows: 

Stock option activity for the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 was as follows:

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company   awarded certain   employe  es   market condition   stock   options   under the 2015 Pla  n, included in the activity above, that vest under specified market conditions. Each employee   was generally awarded two equal tranches of   market   condition   stock options   that   immediately   vest when the Company s common stock trades at either $30 or $40 per share   for ninety consecutive calendar days  .    At September 30, 2016, there was   $15,213   of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options with market conditions, which the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of   four   years. 

(9)  Loss Per Share 

The Company presents basic and dilu  ted loss per share amounts. Basic loss per share   is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to 3D Systems Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during th  e applicable period. Diluted loss per share   is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the applicable period. The following table reconciles basic weighted average outstanding shares to diluted weighted aver  age outstanding for the quarter   and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015: 

The calculation for weighted average outstanding diluted loss per share excludes stock options with an exercise price that exceeds the average market pr  ice of shares during the period  .     In addition to unexercised stock options, there was an immaterial number of additional shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units that were excluded from the diluted share calculations because they were anti-dilutive.

(10)  Fair Value Measurements 

ASC 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ,  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level 1   - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;     

Level 2   - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or     

Level 3   - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     

For the Company, the above standard applies to cash equivalents and earnout consideration. The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.  

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below: 

(a) 

Cash equivalents include funds held in money market instruments and are reported at their current carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments and are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet.     

(b) 

The fair value of the earnout consideration, which is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses, was derived by analyzing the future performance of the acquired businesses using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and adjusting those amounts to reflect the ability of the acquired entities to achieve the stated targets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs, the valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The change in earnout consideration   from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016   reflects a   $917   adjustment to the expected payment  , partially offset by   $  807   of accretion.     

The Company did not have   any     transfers     of     assets   and   liabilities     between     Level 1  ,    Level 2   and   Level 3   of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016. In addition to the assets and liabilities included in the above table, certain of our assets and liabilities are to be initially measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. This includes goodwill and other intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment, in addition to redeemable noncontrolling interests.

(11  )  Income Taxes 

For the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016  , the Company recorded a   benefit   o  f    $2,214   and   a provision of     $665  ,   respectively,   resulting in   effective tax rate  s of     9.4%     of benefit   and   1.5%   of   expense  ,    respectively  , compared to   tax rates of   9.8  %   and   25.7  %   of b  enefit for the quarter and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2015, respectively  .     The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily attributable t  o valuation allowances that the Company   recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions  ,   as well as   an   adjustment that was recorded during th  e third   quarter   of 2016   in connection with completion of the Company s tax return  s  , which resulted in a tax benefit  . 

The Company has not provided for any taxes on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest all such   earnings outside of the U.S. The Company   believe a calculation of the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings is impracticable. 

Tax years 2003 through 2015 remain subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, with most of the years open to examination due to the generation and utilization of net operating losses. The Company files income tax returns (which are open to examination beginning in the year shown in parentheses) in Australia (2012), Belgium (2013), Brazil (2011), China (2013), France (2013), Germany (2012), India (2013), Israel (2012), Italy (2011), Japan (2011), Korea (2011), Mexico (2011), Netherlands (2011), Switzerland (2011), the United Kingdom (2015) and Uruguay (2011)  . 

(12)    Segment Information 

The Company operates in   one   reportable business segment. The Company conducts its business through various offices and facilities located throughout the Asia Pacific region (Australia, China, India, Japan and Korea), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), Israel, Latin America (Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay), Russia and the United States. The Company has historically disclosed summarized financial information for the geographic areas of operations as if they were segments in accordance with ASC 280,    Segment Reporting  .  Financial information concerning the Company s geographical locations is based on the location of the selling entity. Such summarized financial information concerning the Company s geographical operations is shown in the following tables  :

(13)  Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company leases office space and certain furniture and fixtures under various non-cancelable operating leases. For the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, rent expense under operating leases was   $3,542   and   $  9,717  , respectively, compared to   $3,  362   and   $  9,974   for the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2015, respectively. 

As of   September 30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had supply commitments on printer assemblies that totaled   $  38,307     and   $50,663  , respectively. 

Certain of the Company s acquisitions cont  ain earnout   provisions under which the sellers of the acquired businesses can earn additional amounts. The total liability recorded for these earnouts at   September 30  , 2016 was   $9,563  . At December 31, 2015, in addition to earnout provisions, certain of the Company s acquisitions also contained deferred purchase payment arrangements. The total liability recorded for these earnouts and deferred purchase payment arrangements totaled     $9,832   at December 31, 2015  . 

Put Options 

The minority interest shareholders of   a certain subsidiary have the right in certain circumstances to require the Company to acquire either a portion of or all of the remaining ownership interests held by them. The owners  ability to exercise any such  put option  right is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including conditions requiring notice in advance of exercise. In addition, these rights cannot be exercised prior to a specified exercise date. The exercise of these rights at their earliest contractual date would result in obligations of the Company to fund the related amounts in 2019. 

Management estimates, assuming that the subsidiary owned by the Company at   September 30  , 2016   performs over the relevant future periods at its forecasted earnings levels, that these rights, if exercised, could require the Company, in future periods, to pay approximately   $8  ,872     to   the owners of such   put   rights   that require the Company   to acquire such ownership interests in the relevant subsidiary. This amount has been recorded as redeemable noncontrolling i  nterests on the balance sheet as of     September 30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015. The ultimate amount payable relating to this transaction will vary because it is dependent on the future results of operations of the subject business. 

Litigation    

Securities and Derivative Litigation 

The Company and certain of its former executive officers have been named as defendants in a consolidated putative stockholder class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The consolidated action is styled   KBC Asset Management NV v. 3D Systems Corporation, et al.  , Case No. 0:15-cv-02393-MGL.   The Amended Consolidated Complaint (the  Complaint ), which was filed on December 9, 2015, alleges that defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and misleading statements and omissions and that the former officers are control persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Complaint was filed on behalf of stockholders who purchased shares of the Company s common stock between October 29, 2013, and May 5, 2015 and seeks monetary damages on behalf of the purported class. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety on January 14, 2016, which was denied by Memorandum Opinion and Order date  d July 25, 2016 (the  Order ).   Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the Order on August 4, 2016, which is currently pending. 

16   

Nine related derivative complaints have been filed by purported Company stockholders against certain of the Company s former executive officers and members of its Board of Directors.  The Company is named as a nominal   defendant in all   nine   actions.   The derivatives complaints are styled as follows: (1)   Steyn v. Reichental, et al.  , Case No. 2015-CP-46-2225, filed on July 27, 2015 in the Court of Common Pleas for the 16th Judicial Circuit, County of York, South Carolina; (2)   Piguing v. Reichental, et al.  , Case No. 2015-CP-46-2396, filed on August 7, 2015 in the Court of Common Pleas for the 16th Judicial Circuit, County of York, South Carolina; (3)   Booth v. Reichental, et al.  , Case No. 15-692-RGA, filed on August 6, 2015 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware ( Booth ); (4)   Nally v. Reichental, et al.  , Case No. 15-cv-03756-MGL, filed on September 18, 2015 in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina; (5)   Gee v. Hull, et al.  , Case No. BC-610319, filed on February 17, 2016 in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles; (6)   Foster v. Reichental, et al.  , Case No. 0:16-cv-01016-MGL, filed on April 1, 2016 in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina; (7)   Lu v. Hull, et al.  , Case No. BC629730, filed on August 5, 2016 in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles; (8)   Howes v. Reichental, et al.  , Case No. 0:16-cv-2810-MGL, filed on August 11, 2016 in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina; and (9)   Ameduri v. Reichental, et al.  , Case No. 0:16-cv-02995-MGL, filed on September 1, 2016 in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. 

The derivative complaints allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment and seek, among other things, monetary damages and certain corporate governance actions.  

The first six of the derivative complaints listed above have been stayed until the earlier of the close of discovery or the deadline for appealing a dismissal in the KBC Asset Management NV securities class action.    

The Company believes the claims alleged in the putative securities class action and the derivative lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend the Company and its officers and directors vigorously. 

Ronald Barranco and Print3D Corporation v. 3D Systems Corporation, et. al. 

On August 23, 2013, Ronald Barranco, a former Company employee, filed   two   lawsuits against the Company and certain officers in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. The first lawsuit ( Barranco I ) is captioned   Ronald Barranco and Print3D Corporation v. 3D Systems Corporation, 3D Systems, Inc., and Damon Gregoire  , Case No. CV 13-411 LEK RLP, and alleges   seven   causes of action relating to the Company s acquisition of Print3D Corporation (of which Mr. Barranco was a 50% shareholder) and the subsequent employment of Mr. Barranco by the Company. The second lawsuit ( Barranco II ) is captioned   Ronald Barranco v. 3D Systems Corporation, 3D Systems, Inc., Abraham Reichental, and Damon Gregoire  , Case No. CV 13-412 LEK RLP, and alleges the same seven causes of action relating to the Company s acquisition of certain website domains from Mr. Barranco and the subsequent employment of Mr. Barranco by the Company.  Both Barranco I and Barranco II allege the Company breached certain purchase agreements in order to avoid paying Mr. Barranco additional monies pursuant to royalty and earn out provisions in the agreements. The Company and its officers timely filed responsive pleadings on October 22, 2013 seeking,   inter alia  , to dismiss Barranco I due to a mandatory arbitration agreement and for lack of personal jurisdiction and to dismiss Barranco II for lack of personal jurisdiction.  

With regard to Barranco I, the Hawaii district court, on February 28, 2014, denied the Company s motion to dismiss and its motion to transfer venue to South Carolina for the convenience of the parties. However, the Hawaii court recognized that the plaintiff s claims are all subject to mandatory and binding arbitration in Charlotte, North Carolina. Because the Hawaii court was without authority to compel arbitration outside of Hawaii, the court ordered that the case be transferred to the district court encompassing Charlotte (the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina) so that court could compel arbitration in Charlotte. On April 17, 2014, Barranco I was transferred in to the Western District of North Carolina. Plaintiff filed a demand for arbitration on October 29, 2014. On December 9, 2014, the Company filed its answer to plaintiff s demand for arbitration. On February 2, 2015, plaintiff filed an amended demand that removed Mr. Gregoire as a defendant from the matter  ,   and on February 4, 2015 the Company filed its amended answer. The parties selected an arbitrator and arbitration took place in June 2015 in Charlotte, North Carolina.  

On September 28, 2015, the arbitrator issued a final award in favor of Mr. Barranco with respect to   two   alleged breaches of contract and implied covenants arising out of the contract.  The arbitrator found that the Company did not commit fraud or make any negligent misrepresentations to Mr. Barranco. Pursuant to the award, the Company is to pay approximately   $11,282  , which includes alleged actual damages of   $7,254  , fees and expenses of   $2,318   and prejudgment interest of   $1,710  . The Company disagrees with the single arbitrator s findings and conclusions and believes the arbitrator s decision exceeds his authority and disregards the applicable law. As an initial response, the Company filed a motion for modification on September 30, 2015, based on mathematical errors in the computation of damages and fees. On October 16, 2015, the arbitrator issued an order denying the Company s motion and sua sponte issuing a modified final award in favor of Mr. Barranco in the same above-referenced amounts, but making certain substantive changes to the award, which changes the Company believes were improper and outside the scope of his authority and the American Arbitration Association rules. On November 20, 2015, the Company filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in the federal court in the Western District of North Carolina.  Claimants also filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award. A hearing was held on the motions on June 29, 2016 in federal court in the Western District of North Carolina. The court requested supplemental briefing by the parties, which briefs were filed on July 11, 2016.  

17   

On   August 31, 2016, the court issued an Order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiff s motion to confirm the arbitration award and for judgment, entering judgment in the principal amount of the arbitration award and denying Plaintiff s motion for fees and costs.  The court denied the Company s motion to vacate.  On September 7, 2016, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest.  The Company opposed that motion and the parties submitted briefing, which is currently pending before the court. On September 28, 2016 the Company filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.  Plaintiff opposed the motion and the parties submitted briefing, which is currently pending before the court. 

Notwithstanding the Company s right to appeal, given the arbitrator s decision, the Company recorded an $11,282 expense provision for this matter in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The provision is subject to adjustment based on the ultimate outcome of the Company s appeal. If it is ultimately determined that money is owed following the full appellate process in federal court, the Company intends to fund any amounts to be paid from cash on hand. This amount has been classified as a long-term liability given the customary timeline of an appeals process. The Company will review this classification periodically.  

With regard to Barranco II, the Hawaii district court, on March 17, 2014, denied the Company s motion to dismiss and its motion to transfer venue to South Carolina. However, the Hawaii court dismissed Count II in plaintiff s complaint alleging breach of the employment agreement.  The Company filed an answer to the complaint in the Hawaii district court on March 31, 2014.  On November 19, 2014, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims which was heard on January 20, 2015. On January 30, 2015, the court entered an   order granting in part and d  enying in Part the Company s motion for summary judgment. The Order narrowed the plaintiff s claim for breach of contract and dismissed the plaintiff s claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. As a result, Messrs. Reichental and Gregoire were dismissed from the lawsuit. The case was tried to a jury in May 2016, and on May 27, 2016 the jury found that the Company was not liable for either breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Additionally, the jury found in favor of the Company on its counterclaim against Mr. Barranco and determined that Mr. Barranco violated his non-competition covenant with the Company. The Court is expected to order an accounting with respect to the counterclaim. 

The Company is involved in various other legal matters incidental to its business. Although the Company cannot predict the results of litigation with certainty, the Company believes that the disposition of these legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position. 

Indemnification 

In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements to indemnify customers or suppliers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of the Company s products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant, and the Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on its future results of operations.   

To the extent permitted under Delaware law, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was, serving at the Company s request in such capacity, subject to limited exceptions. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, the Company has directors and officers insurance coverage that may enable the Company to recover future amounts paid, subject to a deductible and the policy limits. There is no assurance that the policy limits will be sufficient to cover all damages, if any.

Third Quarter   Highlights 

Total consolidated r  evenue for   the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016   increased   by   3.2%  , or $  4.8   million, to $  156.4   million, compared to $151.6   million   for   the quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  .    These results primarily reflect a  n increase   in products   and   materials   revenue  , partially offset by a     decrease   in   services   revenue, as further discussed below  .       

As of   September 30  , 2016   and 2015  , our backlog was $  43.8     million   and $  40.5   million  , respectively  .    Backlog is primarily dependent on timing of orders and customers  requested deliveries  .    As of   September 30  , 2016   and 2015, backlog included    $  8.9   million     and   $12.9 million, respectively,   of on   demand parts   manufacturing service    o  rders  . 

Healthcare revenue includ  es sales of products, materials   and services for health-related applications, including simulation, training and planning, and printing of surgical instruments an  d medical and dental devices  .   For the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016  , healthcare revenue increased by   23.0  %, to     $  42.5   million, and made up   27.2%   of   total revenue  ,   compared to    $  34.  5   million  , or 22.8  %    of total revenue   for th  e quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  .   The increase in healthcare revenue reflects increased   products,   materials   and serv  ices sales   in healthcare-related applications   that were driven by   customers increasing their investments and expanding their capabilities in precision healthcare  .   

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, s  oftware revenue from products   and services increased by 10.9  %, to   $21  .4 million, and made up 13.7  % of total revenue, compared to     $19.3   mill  ion, or 12.7  % of total revenue   for the quarter ended September 30, 2015  . 

Gros  s profit   for the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016     de  creased   by   3.0  %, or $  2.1   million, to $  68.9   million, compared to $71.0   million for the quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  ,    primarily reflecting charges in connection with our new strategy  , partially offset by higher revenue from products and materials  . 

19   

Gross profit margin for the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016   was   44.1  %, compared to 46.9  % for the quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  , reflecting     a    decrease in products margins that was negatively impacted by charges related to discontinued products, and lower services margins, partially offset by higher materials margins, as further discussed below  . 

O  perating   expenses   for the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016   decreased by   13.9  %,   to   $91.0     million, compared to $  1  05.7   million for the quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  . These results primarily reflect lower   amortization expense  , in addition to lower   legal   expenses    d  ue to a provision for an arbitration   award that was recorded in the third quarter of 2015  ,   partially offset by increased research and development expenses,   as further discussed below. 

Our operating loss   for the   quarter ended   September 30  , 2016   was $  22.0   million  , compared to   an   operating loss of     $  34.6   million   for the quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  ,     primarily   reflecting lower operating expenses  ,    as   further discussed below  .

Results of Operations 

C  omparison of revenue by cla  ss 

We earn revenues from the sale of products, materials and services.     The products category includes 3D printers, healthcare simulators and digitizers and design tools including software products, scanners and haptic devices.   The materials category includes   a wide range of print materials   to be used with our 3D printers  , the majority of which are proprietary.     The services category includes warranty and maintenance on 3D printers and simulators, software maintenance, on demand parts manufacturing services and healthcare services. 

Due to the relatively high price of certain 3D printers and a corresponding lengthy selling cycle and relatively low unit volume of   the higher priced   printer  s    in any particular period, a shift in the timing and concentration of orders and shipments from one period to another can affect reported revenue in any given period. Revenue reported in any particular period is also affected by timing of revenue recognition under rules prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles   ( GAAP )  . 

In addition to changes in sales volumes, including the impact of revenue from acquisitions, there are two other primary drivers of changes in revenue from one period to another:   (1)   the combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices, sometimes referred to as price and mix effects, and   (2)   the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies. As used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis, the price and mix effects relate to changes in revenue that are not able to be specifically related to changes in unit volume. 

Table 1 and Table 2 below set forth c  hange in revenue   by class for the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2016  , respectively. 

Table 1 

20   

Table 2 

For the quarter and   nine months   ended September 30, 2016  , t  otal consolidated revenue   increased   by   3.2  %   and   decreased by     3.3  %, respectively  , compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in revenue for the quarter was   driven by   higher   products and   materials   revenue  , partially offset by lower services revenue  . The decrease in revenue for the nine months was driven by   lower products and services revenue, partially offset by higher materials revenue  . 

The increase in products revenue for the quarter is primarily driven by an increase in sales of healthcare-related applications.   The decrease in products revenue   for the   nine months     was primarily driven by lower sales of 3D printers and the discontinuation of consumer products  , combined with the unfavorable impact of mix  .   

For the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2016  , software revenue   included in the products category  , including scanners and haptic devices, contributed $  10.  8   million   and $  31.  7   million,   respectively, compared to $10.4     and $32.0     million for the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2015  ,    respectively  . 

The increase in materials revenue   for the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016   primarily   reflects an   increased demand   for materials   driven by production customers. 

For the quarter     ended   September 30  , 2016  , sales of integrated materials increased   by   7.5  %   to $  29.3   million, or   77.1  % of total materials revenue, compared to   $27.3   million, or   78.3  %    for the   quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  .     For the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, sales of integrated materials increased   by   7.6  %   to $  90.5   million, or   77.2  % of total mate  rials revenue, compared to $84.1 million, or 77.6  % for the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2015. 

The decrease in services revenue for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by a decrease in on demand parts manufacturing services  . 

For the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016  , services revenue from on   demand parts   manufacturing   services decreased   15.7  % to $  26.5   million, compared   to $31.5     million   for quarter ended   September 30  , 2015  .    For the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, services revenue from on demand parts manufacturing   services decreased   17.1  % to $  80.4   millio  n, compared to $97.0     million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2015  .   

For the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2016  , software   revenue included in the   services   category   contributed   $  10.  6   million   and $  32.0   million   of revenue,   respectively,   compared to $8.9   million     and $24.3   million   for the quarter   and   nine months   ended     September 30  , 2015  ,    respectively  .

Comparison of   revenue by geographic region 

Table 3 and Table 4 below set for  th    c  hange in revenue by geographic area for the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016  , respectively 

Table 3 

Table 4 

The incr  e  ase   in revenue   from the Americas for the quarter   primarily reflects   increased sales from healthcare-related applications, while the decrease in revenue for the quarter from the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions primarily reflects lower sales of 3D printers and on demand parts manufacturing services.      The decrease in revenue in   all geographic regions   for the   nine months   primarily reflects lower sales of 3D printers and on demand parts   manufacturing services,   partially offset by increased   sales from   materials, software and healt  hcare  -related applications  .   

For the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, r  ev  enue   from operations outside the U.S., including Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific,   was     45.8  %     and   49.1  %    of total revenue  , respectively, compa  red to 51.1  %   and 50.5  %    for the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2015  , respectively  . 

Gross profit and gross profit margins 

Table 5 and Table 6 below set forth g  ross   profit and gross profit margin for the   quarter  s   and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016   and 2015  , respectively. 

Table 5 

22   

Table 6 

Total consolidated gross profit for the quarter and nine months   ended September 30, 2016   de  creased, primarily driven by   write-down     charges related to inventory and production assets in connection with our updated strategy and discontinuation of certain products.  See Note 2  . 

Gross profit margin for products decreased for the quarter and ni  ne months     ended September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by   charges r  elated to our updated strategy. 

Gross profit margin for materials   increased    f  or the quarter   and nine months     ended September 30, 2016  ,   reflecting   improved supply chain efficiencies  ,     partially offset by the unfavorable impact of mix. 

Gross prof  it margin for services decreased   for the quarter and   nine months     ended September 30, 2016  ,   primarily driven   by higher printer service costs and lower on-demand parts margins. 

For the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, o  n demand parts manufacturing services gross profit margin   was   43.7  %     and   44.1  %, respectively,   compared to 43.8  %    and 44.5  %    for the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2015  , respectively  . 

Operating expenses 

Table 7 and Table 8 below set forth c  omponents   of operating expenses for the   quarter  s     and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 

Table 7 

Table 8 

Total operating expenses decreased   for the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016  ,    primarily   reflecting lower selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed below. 

23   

Third quarter 

For the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016, s  elling, general and administrative expenses decreased  ,   primarily due to a $9.  4 million decrease in legal expenses   primarily related to a provision for arbitration award recorded in the third quarter of 2015, a $7.0   million dec  rease in   amortization expense, and a $1.3   million decrease in   compensation   costs   from   lower stock-based compensation costs  . 

For the quarter ended   September 30  , 2016, research an  d development expenses increased,   primarily due   to $6.1   million     of   charges and write-offs   related to our updated strategy and re-prioritization of certain R D projects  , partially offset by     a $1.1   million decrease in   outside services associated with product development  . 

Nine months 

For the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016,   selling, general and administrative expens  es de  creased  ,   primarily due to a $21.3   million d  ecrease in amortization expense and   a $9.  3 million decrease in legal expenses   primarily related to a provision for arbitration award recorded in the third quarter of 2015  . 

For the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, research and development expense  s d  ecreased  ,   primarily due to a $3.9   million decrease in   outside services associated with product development  , a $  2.7 million decrease   in   overhead allocations   due to   facility consolidations  , a $1.7 million decrease in   purchased materials  , and a $0.5 million decrease in compensation costs, partially offset by $6.1 million of expenses related to our updated strategy and re-prioritization of certain R D projects  . 

Loss   from operations 

Table 9 below sets forth o  perating loss   by geographic area for the   quarters and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 

Table   9 

The improvement in operating loss   for the quarter and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016   was   primarily driven by   lower operating expenses. See    Gross profit and gross profit margins    and    Operating expenses    above  . 

With   respect to the Americas, for the quarter   and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016   and 2015  ,    the changes in operating income   (loss)   reflected the same factors relating to our consolidated operating income   (loss)   that are discussed above  . 

The changes in operating income   (loss)   in our operations outs  ide the Americas for the quarter   and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016   and 2015   resulted   primarily from transfer pricing, changes in sales volume and foreign currency translation  .

Interest and other     (  income  )    expense, net 

Table 10 below sets forth c  omponents of interest and other   (  income  )    expense, net, for the   quarters and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 

Table 10 

Benefit and provision   for income taxes 

For the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2016  , we recorded a $  2.2   million   benefit     and $  0.7   million   provision for income taxes  , respectively, compa  red to a $3.5 million and $20.6   million benefit   for   the quarter   and   nine months     ended   September 30  , 2015  .     The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily attributable to valua  tion allowances that we   recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, as   well as an   adjustment that   was recorded during the third quarter of 2016 in connection with   the   completion of our tax return  s  , which resulted in a tax benefit  . 

Net loss

Other Financial Information 

In addition to our results determined under GAAP discussed above, management believes non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and facilitate a better understanding of the impact that strategic acquisitions, non-recurring charges   and certain non-cash expenses   had on our financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by our management about which costs, expenses and other items are excluded from our GAAP financial statements in determining our non-GAAP financial measures. We have sought to compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and expected future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP financial statements as required in our public disclosures as well as reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to our GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the following items  :   

Amortization and stock-based compensation  .    We exclude   intangible asset amortization     expense and non-cash stock based compensation expense  .       

Legal and acquisition related   expenses  .   We exclude   charges associ  ated with arbitration awards,   litigation settlements   and severance   costs  , in addition to charges in connection with business acquisitions, which generally include earnout amortization and other acquisition-related fees.     

Po  rtfolio re-alignment  .   We exclude charges associated with discontinued product lines, strategic decisions and re-prioritization of projects  .

(a)     Tax effect for   the quarter ended March 31, 2016   and earlier periods was calculated quarterly, based on the Company s overall tax rate for each quarter. Tax effect for   the quarter ended     September 30  , 2016   was calculated based on the Company s quarterly U.S. tax rate  ,   which was 0% as a result of the valuation allowance   that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015,   in   connection with GAAP net   losses.

Financial Condition and Liquidity 

Table   15 

We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated wi  th our existing operations   in the foreseeable future,   or to consummate significant acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologie  s. However, it is possible that, in the future,   we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities. If needed, we may be able to raise such funds by issuing equity or debt securities to the public or selected investors, or by borrowing from financial institutions, selling assets or restructuring debt. There is no assurance, however, that funds will be available from these sources in the amounts or on terms acceptable to us. Cash equivalents comprise funds held in money market instruments and are reported at their current carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments. We strive to minimize our credit risk by investing primarily in investment grade, liquid instruments and limit exposure to any one issuer depending upon credit quality. See   Cash flow, Credit facilities   and   Capitalized lease obligations   below  . 

If we need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our   activities,   or for other reasons  ,   and   raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing   shareholders would be diluted.   In addition, the equity or debt securities that we may issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. 

Cash held outside the U.S.   at   September 30  , 2016   was    $  78.0   million  , or 43.5%   of   total cash and equivalents,   compared to   $59.0   million  , or 37.6%   of total cash and equivalents   at December 31, 2015. Cash held outside the U.S. is used in our foreign operations for working capital purposes and is considered to be permanently invested; consequently, we have not provided for any taxes on repatriation.  

Days  sales outstanding was   71   days at   September 30  , 2016   compared to 79   days at December 31, 2015 and accounts receivable more   than 90 days past due decreased     to 13.4  %   of gross receivables, from 17.6%   at December 31, 2015. We review specific receivables   quarterly   to determine the appropriate reserve for accounts receivable based on the change in days  sales outstanding. 

29   

The majority of our inventory consists of finished goods, including products, materials and service parts. Inventory also consists of raw materials and spare parts for the in-house assembly and support service products. We outsource the assembly of certain 3D printers; therefore, we generally do not hold most parts for the assembly of these printers in inventory  .    

The changes that make up the other components of working capital not discussed above arose in the ordinary course of business. Differences between the amounts of working capital item changes in the cash flow statement and the balance sheet changes for the corresponding items are primarily the result of foreign currency translation adjustments. 

Cash flow 

Table 16   below sets forth c  omponents of cash flow for the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015  , respectively.

Cash flow from operating activities 

Table 1  7 

For further discu  ssion of net loss  , see    Net loss       above  .   

Non-cash charges primarily consist of   depreciation, amortization,   stock-based compensation  , inventory reserve of discontinued products,   and asset impairment  , partially offset by the benefit of deferred income taxes  . 

For further discussion of changes in working capital, see    Financial Condition and Liquidity    above. Differences between the amounts of working capital item changes in the cash flow statement and the balance sheet changes for the corresponding items are primarily the result of foreign currency translation adjustments  .

Cash flow from investing activities 

Table 1  8 

Purchases of property and equipment   primarily consisted of expenditures for leasehold improvements, including expanding facilities and investing in infrastructu  re, equipment to support our on   demand parts   manufacturing   service and printers associated with new product development efforts. Other investing activities consist of minority     investments of less than 20% made through 3D Ventures, our venture investment initiative, in promising enterprises that we believe will benefit from or be powered by our technologies  .    We made no acquisitions during the quarter or   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016. 

Cash flow from financing activities 

Table 1  9 

Contractual commitments and   off-balance sheet arrangements 

Credit facilities 

In October 2014, we entered into a $150.0 million five-year revolving, unsecured credit facility. The agreement provides for advances in the initial aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million. Subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the agreement,   we may  , at   our   option  ,   request an increase in the aggregate principal amount available under the credit facility by an additional $75.0 million. As of   September 30  , 2016   and December 31, 2015,   there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility.   As of September 30, 2016, we meet all   financial covenant   requirements and have full   availability on the   c  redit   f  acility  .   Future results may impact availability.   See Note 7     for additional information related to the credit facility  . 

Capitalized lease obligations 

Our capitalized lease obligations include   a    lease agre  ement   that we entered into during 2006 with respect to our Rock Hill, SC facility, in addition to other lease agreements assumed through acquisitions.  In accordance with ASC 840,  Leases,  we are considered an owner of the properties, therefore, we have reco  rded the amounts shown in the   table below   as      building      in our consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding capitalized lease obligation in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet.  

Table 20   below sets forth o  utstanding capitalized leas  e obligations carrying values as of     September 30  , 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Table   20 

31   

O  ther contractual arrangements 

Certain of   our   acquisitions contain earnout provisions under which the sellers of the acquired businesses can earn additional amounts. The total liability recorded for these earnouts   at September 30, 2016 was $9.6 million  . At December 31, 2015, in addition to ear  nout provisions, certain of our   acquisitions also contained deferred purchase payment arrangements. The total liability recorded for these earnouts and deferred purchase pay  ment arrangements totaled $9.8 million   at December 31, 2015  . 

As of   September 30  , 2016  , we have supply commitments related to printer assemblies that to  tal $  38.3   million compared to $50.7 million at December 31, 2015. 

The minority interest shareholders of a certain subsidiary have the right to require us to acquire either a portion of or all ownership interest under certain circumstances pursuant to a contractual arrangement, and we have a similar call option under the same contractual terms. The amount of consideration under the put and call rights is not a fixed amount, but rather is dependent upon various valuation formulas and on future events, such as revenue and gross margin performance of the subsidiary through the date of exercise, as described in Note 13. Management estimates, assuming that the subsidiary owned by us at September 30, 2016 performs over the relevant future periods at its forecasted earnings levels, that these rights, if exercised, could require us in a future period to pay a maximum   of approximately   $8.9   million to the owners of such     put rights. This amount has been recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interests on the balance sheet at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  . 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements and do not utilize any  structured debt,   special purpose,  or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes. 

Financial instruments 

We conduct business in various countries using both the functional currencies of those countries and other currencies to effect cross border transactions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the dates that those transactions are entered into and their respective settlement dates will result in a foreign exchange gain or loss. When practicable, we endeavor to match assets and liabilities in the same currency on our balance sheet and those of our subsidiaries in order to reduce these risks. We also, when we consider it to be appropriate, enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge exposures arising from those transactions. There were no foreign exchange contracts at   September 30  , 2016   or December 31, 2015. 

We do not hedge for trading or speculative purposes, and our foreign currency contracts are generally short-term in nature, typically maturing in 90 days or less. We have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging,  and therefore, we recognize all gains and losses (realized or unrealized) in interest and other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). 

Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in interest and other   expense, net, in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income   (loss)  . Depending on their fair value at the end of the reporting period, derivatives are recorded either in prepaid and other current assets or in accrued liabilities in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Item     4.    Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

As of   September 30  , 2016  , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. These controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, including an evaluation of the rules referred to above in this Item 4, management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30  , 2016   to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
