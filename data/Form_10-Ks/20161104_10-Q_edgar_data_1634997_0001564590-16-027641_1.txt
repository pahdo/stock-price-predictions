Note 1. Background and Nature of Operations 
 Avangrid, Inc., formerly Iberdrola USA, Inc. (AVANGRID, we or the Company), is an energy services holding company engaged in the regulated energy distribution business through its principal subsidiary Avangrid Networks, Inc. (Networks). Effective as of April 30, 2016, UIL Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries (UIL) were transferred to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Networks. AVANGRID is also in the renewable energy generation and gas storage and trading businesses through its principal subsidiary, Avangrid Renewables Holding, Inc. (ARHI). ARHI in turn holds subsidiaries including Avangrid Renewables LLC (Renewables) and Enstor Gas, LLC (Gas). AVANGRID is an 81.5% owned subsidiary of Iberdrola, S.A. (Iberdrola), a corporation organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain. The remaining outstanding shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and owned by various shareholders. AVANGRID was organized in 1997 as NGE Resources, Inc. under the laws of New York as the holding company for the principal operating utility companies.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our interest in Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P. (Iroquois) to an unaffiliated third party for proceeds of $53.8 million and an impact to net income of $19.0 million. 
   
 Note 2. Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements of Avangrid, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the three years ended December 31, 2015 included in AVANGRID s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements are prepared on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of AVANGRID and its consolidated subsidiaries Networks and ARHI. Consolidated accounts of UIL have been included in the consolidated financial statements of AVANGRID since December 16, 2015, the date of acquisition of UIL. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and note disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. 
 We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for the interim periods described herein. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature, except as otherwise disclosed. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 
 Revision of estimated useful lives of wind power station assets at Renewables 
 Renewables  wind power station assets in service less salvage value, if any, are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Renewables  effective depreciation rate, excluding decommissioning, was 4.0% in both 2015 and 2014. Renewables reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. In the first quarter of 2016, this review indicated that the actual lives of certain assets at wind power stations are expected to be longer than the previously estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, Renewables changed the estimates of the useful lives of certain assets from 25 years to 40 years, capped at the lease term if lower, to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets are expected to remain in service. The weighted average useful life of our wind farm assets is now approximately 30 years. We are continuing to assess lease extensions with leaseholders to potentially increase the average useful life of our wind farm assets to more than 30 years.   The effect of this change in estimate was to reduce depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $13 million and $38 million, reduce asset retirement obligation accretion expense recorded within operations and maintenance by approximately $1 and $2 million, increase earnings from equity method investments by approximately $2 million and $4 million, increase net income by $9 million and $27 million and increase basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.03 and $0.09 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. For the full year 2016, the effect of this change on income before income tax and net income is estimated to be an increase of approximately $59 million and approximately $37 million,  
 10 

respectively, and the impact on earnings per share is estimated to be an increase of approximately $0.12 per share on a basic and diluted basis  .  

Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements 
 As of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to any significant accounting policies described in our combined and consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the three years ended December 31, 2015. There have been no new accounting pronouncements issued since the filing of the combined and consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the three years ended December 31, 2015, that we expect to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated interim financial statements. 

Note 4. Acquisition of UIL 
 On December 16, 2015 (acquisition date), we completed our acquisition of UIL, a diversified energy company with its portfolio of regulated utility companies in Connecticut and Massachusetts that is expected to provide us with a greater flexibility to grow the combined regulated businesses through project development and create an enhanced platform to develop transmission and distribution projects in the Northeastern United States. In connection with the consummation of the acquisition, we issued 309,490,839 shares of common stock of AVANGRID, out of which 252,234,989 shares were issued to Iberdrola through a stock dividend, accounted for as a stock split, with no change to par value, at par value of $0.01 per share and 57,255,850 shares (including those held in trust as Treasury Stock) were issued to UIL shareowners in addition to payment of $595 million in cash. Following the completion of the acquisition, former UIL shareowners owned 18.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of AVANGRID, and Iberdrola owned the remaining shares. 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. This method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, with certain exceptions, be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. 
 As UIL s common stock was publicly traded in an active market until the acquisition date, we determined that UIL s common stock is more reliably measurable than the common stock of AVANGRID to determine the fair value of the consideration transferred in the transaction.  
 The purchase consideration for UIL under the acquisition method is based on the stock price of UIL on the acquisition date multiplied by the number of shares issued by AVANGRID to the UIL shareowners after applying an equity exchange factor to the shares of vested restricted common stock of UIL (other than those UIL restricted shares that vest by their terms upon the consummation of the acquisition), performance shares and other shares awards under UIL 2008 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan and the UIL Deferred Compensation Plan. The  equity exchange factor  is the sum of one plus a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the cash consideration and (ii) the denominator of which is the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of UIL common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that immediately precedes the closing date of the acquisition minus $10.50. The determination of the purchase price is based on a UIL stock price of $50.10 per share, which represents the closing stock price on the acquisition date. 
 11 

The fair value of AVANGRID common stock issued to the UIL shareowners in the business combination represents the purchase consideration in the business combination,   which was computed as follows:  

(2)   
 
 Based on UIL s shares of vested restricted stock.    

(3)   
 
 Based on UIL s restricted shares that vested upon the change in control.    

(4)   
 
 Based on UIL s vested performance shares award.    

(5)   
 
 Based on the closing share price of UIL common stock on December 16, 2015 less the cash component of $10.50, which is not applicable to restricted shares (other than those UIL restricted shares that vest by their terms upon the consummation of the acquisition), performance shares and other awards under the UIL 2008 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan and the UIL Deferred Compensation Plan.     

The following is a summary of the components of the consideration transferred to UIL s shareowners: 

UIL s financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results for the periods subsequent to the December 16, 2015 acquisition date. The following table represents summarized unaudited pro forma financial information as if UIL had been included in our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The unaudited pro forma results include: (i) elimination of accrued transaction costs representing non-recurring expenses directly related to the transaction, and (ii) the associated tax impact on this unaudited pro forma adjustment. 
 12 

The unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any cost saving synergies from   operating efficiencies or the effect of the incremental costs incurred in integrating the two companies. Accordingly, these unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purpose only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual resu  lts of operations of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they indicative of future results of operations:  

The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our acquisition of UIL was based on a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. For the majority of UIL s assets and liabilities, primarily property, plant and equipment, fair value was determined to be the respective carrying amounts of the predecessor entity. UIL s operations are conducted in a regulated environment where the regulatory authority allows an approved rate of return on the carrying amount of the regulated asset base. Management is in the process of finalizing our detailed analysis of various items, predominantly non-rate regulated activities, to reflect the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. The primary areas of the purchase price that are not yet finalized include, but are not limited to the allocation of the purchase price to the following: equity method investments; contracts; debt; contingent liabilities, including those related to certain environmental sites; income taxes; non-regulated property, plant and equipment and goodwill. We will finalize these amounts no later than December 16, 2016. Under U.S. GAAP, the measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments that we determine to be material will be recognized in future periods in our consolidated financial statements. 
 The following is a summary of the preliminary allocation of the purchase price as of the acquisition date: 

Goodwill generated from the acquisition of UIL has been assigned to the reporting units under the Networks reportable segment and is primarily attributable to expected future growth of the combined regulated businesses and enhanced platform to develop transmission and distribution projects in the Northeastern United States. The goodwill generated from this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. As part of the preliminary allocation of the purchase price we have determined a fair value of contingent liabilities of approximately $44.0 million relating to certain environmental sites. 

Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
 Pursuant to the requirements concerning accounting for regulated operations, our utilities capitalize, as regulatory assets, incurred and accrued costs that are probable of recovery in future electric and natural gas rates. We base our assessment of whether recovery is probable on the existence of regulatory orders that allow for recovery of certain costs over a specific period, or allow for reconciliation or deferral of certain costs. When costs are not treated in a specific order we use regulatory precedent to determine if recovery is probable. Our operating utilities also record, as regulatory liabilities, obligations to refund previously collected revenue or to spend revenue collected from customers on future costs. Substantially all assets or liabilities for which funds have been expended or received are either included in the rate base or are accruing a carrying cost until they will be included in the rate base. The primary items that  
 13 

are not included in the rate base or accruing carrying costs are the regulatory assets for qualified pension and other postretirement benefits, which reflect unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, debt p  remium, environmental remediation costs which is primarily the offset of accrued liabilities for future spending, unfunded future income taxes, which are the offset to the unfunded future deferred income tax liability recorded  ,   asset retirement obligations  , hedge losses and contracts for differences. The total amount of these items is approximately $2,700 million.  
 Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities shown in the tables below result from various regulatory orders that allow for the deferral and/or reconciliation of specific costs.  Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are classified as current when recovery or refund in the coming year is allowed or required through a specific order or when the rates related to a specific regulatory asset or regulatory liability are subject to automatic annual adjustment. 
 On June 15, 2016, the New York State Public Service Commission (NYPSC) approved the Joint Proposal (Proposal) in connection with a three-year rate plan for electric and gas service at New York State Electric   Gas Corporation (NYSEG) and Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation (RGE) effective May 1, 2016. Following the approval of the Proposal most of these items related to NYSEG are amortized over a five-year period, except the portion of storm costs to be recovered over ten years, unfunded deferred taxes being amortized over a period of fifty years and plant related tax items which are amortized over the life of associated plant. Annual amortization expense for NYSEG is approximately $16.5 million per rate year. RGE items that are being amortized are plant related tax items, which are amortized over the life of associated plant, and unfunded deferred taxes being amortized over a period of fifty years. A majority of the other items related to RGE, which net to a regulatory liability, remains deferred and will not be amortized until future proceedings or will be used to recover costs of the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement (Ginna RSSA). 
 In the approved Proposal the allowed rate of return on common equity is 9.0% for all companies. The equity ratio for each company is 48%; however the equity ratio is set at 50% for earnings sharing purposes. The customer share of any earnings above allowed levels increases as the ROE increases, with customers receiving 50%, 75% and 90% of earnings over 9.5%, 10.0% and 10.5% ROE, respectively, in the first year. The rate plans also include the implementation of a rate adjustment mechanism designed to return or collect certain defined reconciled revenues and costs; new depreciation rates; and continuation of the existing revenue decoupling mechanisms for each business. Following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC, unfunded future income taxes were adjusted for the amount of $126 million to reflect the change from a flow through to normalization method, which was recorded as an increase to income tax expense and an offsetting increase to revenue, during the second quarter of 2016. The amounts will be collected over a period of fifty years. 
 On July 1, 2016, the United Illuminating Company (UI) filed an application with the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) requesting approval of a three-year rate plan commencing January 1, 2017, and extending through December 31, 2019. We expect PURA to rule on UI s rate request in December 2016. UI s application requests an increase of $65.6 million in 2017, an additional $21.1 million in 2018, and an additional $13.4 million in 2019, totaling $100.1 million over the three years. During the litigation of the case, the three-year cumulative request was modified to $98.3 million. The original application includes a rate levelization proposal to moderate the customer impact of the necessary revenue increases. The proposal defers a portion of the first and second year increases and spreads recovery of the overall increase by approximately equivalent amounts over the three years of the rate plan with carrying charges included. The proposal results in levelized revenue requirement increases of $40.7 million in 2017, $47.4 million in 2018 and $39.1 million in 2019, followed by an offset of $25.6 million at the end of the three year rate plan to equate the levelized recovery to the non-levelized revenue requirement increase. 
 UI s rate request is attributable primarily to the amount of capital expenditures devoted to its electric distribution system for the purpose of reliability and system resiliency, both in relation to routine operations and during major storm events. UI s application also proposes continuation of its revenue decoupling mechanism and proposes a new earnings sharing mechanism (ESM). Under the proposed ESM, 50% of UI s earnings in excess of the allowed ROE, plus a deadband above the allowed ROE, would be flowed through to the benefit of customers. The proposed ESM includes a 20-basis point deadband in 2017 above the authorized ROE, within which there would be no sharing.  This deadband would be 30 basis points in 2018 and 40 basis points in 2019. UI proposes to continue applying any dollars due to customers to reduce the storm regulatory asset, if one exists. If none exists, then the customer share would be provided through a bill credit. 
 14 

Current and non-current regulatory assets as o  f September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consisted of:  

Pension and other post-retirement benefits  represent the actuarial losses on the pension and other post-retirement plans that will be reflected in customer rates when they are amortized and recognized in future pension expenses.  Pension and other post-retirement benefits cost deferrals  include the difference between actual expense for pension and other post-retirement benefits and the amount provided for in rates for certain of our regulated utilities. The recovery of these amounts will be determined in future proceedings. 
  Storm costs  for Central Maine Power (CMP), NYSEG and RGE are allowed in rates based on an estimate of the routine costs of service restoration. The companies are also allowed to defer unusually high levels of service restoration costs resulting from major storms when they meet certain criteria for severity and duration. The portion of storm costs for the amount of $123 million is being recovered over ten-year period and the remaining portion is being amortized over five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. UI is allowed to defer costs associated with any storm totaling $1 million or greater for future recovery. UI s storm regulatory asset balance was $0 as of September 30, 2016. 
  Deferred meter replacement costs  represent the deferral of the book value of retired meters which were replaced by advanced metering infrastructure meters. This amount is being amortized over the initial depreciation period of related retired meters. 
  Unamortized losses on reacquired debt  represent deferred losses on debt reacquisitions that will be recovered over the remaining original amortization period of the reacquired debt. 
 15 

Unfunded future income taxes  represent unrecovered federal and state income taxes primarily resulting from regulatory flow   through accounting treatment and are the offset to the unfunded future deferred income tax liability recorded. The income tax benefits or charges for certain plant related timing differences, such as removal costs, are immediately flowed through to, or co  llected from, customers. This amount is being amortized as the amounts related to temporary differences that give rise to the deferrals are recovered in rates. Following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC,   these amounts will be collected over a   peri  od of   fifty years, and the NYPSC Staff will perform an audit of the unfunded future income taxes and other tax assets to verify the balances.  
  Asset retirement obligations  (ARO) represent the differences in timing of the recognition of costs associated with our AROs and the collection of such amounts through rates. This amount is being amortized at the related depreciation and accretion amounts of the underlying liability. 
  Deferred property taxes  represents the customer portion of the difference between actual expense for property taxes and the amount provided for in rates. The New York (NY) amount is being amortized over a five year period following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC.  
  Federal tax depreciation normalization adjustment  represents the revenue requirement impact of the difference in the deferred income tax expense required to be recorded under the IRS normalization rules and the amount of deferred income tax expense that was included in cost of service for rates years covering 2011 forward. The recovery period in NY is from 27 to 39 years and for CMP this will be determined in future Maine Public Utility Commission (MPUC) rate proceedings. 
  Hardship Programs  represent hardship customer accounts deferred for future recovery to the extent they exceed the amount in rates. 
  Deferred Purchased Gas  represents the difference between actual gas costs and gas costs collected in rates. 
  Environmental remediation costs  includes spending that has occurred and is eligible for future recovery in customer rates. Environmental costs are currently recovered through a reserve mechanism whereby projected spending is included in rates with any variance recorded as a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability. The amortization period will be established in future proceedings and will depend upon the timing of spending for the remediation costs. It also includes the anticipated future rate recovery of costs that are recorded as environmental liabilities since these will be recovered when incurred. Because no funds have yet been expended for the regulatory asset related to future spending, it does not accrue carrying costs and is not included within rate base. 
  Contracts for Differences  represent the deferral of unrealized gains and losses on contracts for differences derivative contracts.  The balance fluctuates based upon quarterly market analysis performed on the related derivatives. The amounts, which do not earn a return, are fully offset by a corresponding derivative asset/liability. 
  Debt premium  represents the regulatory asset recorded to offset the fair value adjustment to the regulatory component of the non-current debt of UIL at the acquisition date. This amount is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the related outstanding debt instruments. 
  Deferred Transmission Expense  represents deferred transmission income or expense and fluctuates based upon actual revenues and revenue requirements. 
 16 

Current and non-current regulatory liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and Decemb  er 31, 2015, respectively, consisted of:  

Reliability support services (Cayuga)  represents the difference between actual expenses for reliability support services and the amount provided for in rates. This will be refunded to customers within the next year. 
  Non by-passable charges  represent the non by-passable charge paid by all customers. An asset or liability is recognized resulting from differences between actual revenues and the underlying cost being recovered. This liability will be refunded to customers within the next year. 
 17 

Energy efficiency portfolio standard  represents the difference between revenue billed to customers   through an energy efficiency charge and the costs of our energy efficiency programs as approved by the state authorities. This may be refunded to customers within the next year.  
  Accrued removal obligations  represent the differences between asset removal costs recorded and amounts collected in rates for those costs. The amortization period is dependent upon the asset removal costs of underlying assets and the life of the utility plant. 
  Asset sale gain account  represents the gain on NYSEG s 2001 sale of its interest in Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear generating station. The net proceeds from the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear generating station were placed in this account and will be used to benefit customers. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. 
  Carrying costs on deferred income tax bonus depreciation  represent the carrying costs benefit of increased accumulated deferred income taxes created by the change in tax law allowing bonus depreciation. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. 
  Economic development  represents the economic development program which enables NYSEG and RGE to foster economic development through attraction, expansion, and retention of businesses within its service territory. If the level of actual expenditures for economic development allocated to NYSEG and RGE varies in any rate year from the level provided for in rates, the difference is refunded to ratepayers. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. 
  Merger capital expense target customer credit  account was created as a result of NYSEG and RGE not meeting certain capital expenditure requirements established in the order approving the purchase of Energy East by Iberdrola. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. 
  Pension and other postretirement benefits  represent the actuarial gains on other postretirement plans that will be reflected in customer rates when they are amortized and recognized in future expenses. Because no funds have yet been received for this a regulatory liability is not reflected within rate base. They also represent the difference between actual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits and the amount provided for in rates. Recovery of these amounts will be determined in future proceedings. 
  Positive benefit adjustment  resulted from Iberdrola s 2008 acquisition of Energy East. This is being used to moderate increases in rates. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC and included in the Ginna RSSA settlement. 
  New York state tax rate change  represents excess funded accumulated deferred income tax balance caused by the 2014 New York state tax rate change from 7.1% to 6.5%. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. 
  Post term amortization  represents the revenue requirement associated with certain expired joint proposal amortization items. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. 
  Theoretical reserve flow thru impact  represents the differences from the rate allowance for applicable federal and state flow through impacts related to the excess depreciation reserve amortization. It also represents the carrying cost on the differences. The amortization period is five years following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC. 
  Merger-related rate credits  resulted from the acquisition of UIL. This is being used to moderate increases in rates. In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, $0 and $20 million of rate credits was applied against customer bills. 
  Excess generation service charge  represents deferred generation-related and non by-passable federally mandated congestion costs or revenues for future recovery from or return to customers.  The amount fluctuates based upon timing differences between revenues collected from rates and actual costs incurred. 
  Low Income Programs  represent various hardship and payment plan programs approved for recovery. 
  Other  includes cost of removal being amortized through rates and various items subject to reconciliation including variable rate debt, Medicare subsidy benefits and stray voltage collections.

Note 6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  
 We determine the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities and available for sale non-current investments associated with Networks  activities utilizing market approach valuation techniques: 

We measure the fair value of our noncurrent investments using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and include the measurements in Level 1. The available for sale investments, which are Rabbi Trusts for deferred compensation plans, primarily consist of money market funds and are included in Level 1 fair value measurement.     

NYSEG and RGE enter into electric energy derivative contracts to hedge the forecasted purchases required to serve their electric load obligations. They hedge their electric load obligations using derivative contracts that are settled based upon Locational Based Marginal Pricing published by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). RGE hedges all its electric load obligations using contracts for a NYISO location where an active market exists. The forward market prices used to value RGE s open electric energy derivative contracts are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with no adjustment required and therefore we include the fair value in Level 1. NYSEG has a combination of Level 1 and Level 2 fair values for its electric energy derivative contracts. A portion of its electric load obligations are exchange traded contracts in a NYISO location where an active market exists. The forward market prices used to value NYSEG s open electric energy derivative contracts are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with no adjustment required and therefore we include the fair value in Level 1. A portion of NYSEG s electric energy derivative contracts are non-exchange traded contracts that are valued using inputs that are directly observable for the asset or liability, or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data and therefore we include the fair value in Level 2.     

NYSEG and RGE enter into natural gas derivative contracts to hedge their forecasted purchases required to serve their natural gas load obligations. The forward market prices used to value open natural gas derivative contracts are exchange-based prices for the identical derivative contracts traded actively on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Because we use prices quoted in an active market we include the fair value measurements in Level 1.     

NYSEG, RGE and CMP enter into fuel derivative contracts to hedge their unleaded and diesel fuel requirements for their fleet vehicles. Exchange-based forward market prices are used but because an unobservable basis adjustment is added to the forward prices we include the fair value measurement for these contracts in Level 3.     

Contracts for differences (CfDs) entered into by The United Illuminating Company (UI) are marked-to-market based on a probability-based expected cash flow analysis that is discounted at risk-free interest rates and an adjustment for non-performance risk using credit default swap rates. We include the fair value measurement for these contracts in Level 3 (See Note 7 for further discussion on CfDs).     

 We determine the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities associated with Renewables and Gas activities utilizing market approach valuation techniques. Exchange-traded transactions, such as NYMEX futures contracts, that are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical product with no adjustment are included in the Level 1 fair value. Contracts with delivery periods of two years or less which are traded in active markets and are valued with or derived from observable market data for identical or similar products such as over-the-counter NYMEX, foreign exchange swaps, and fixed price physical and basis and index trades are included in Level 2 fair value. Contracts with delivery periods exceeding two years or that have unobservable inputs or inputs that cannot be corroborated with market data for identical or similar products are included in Level 3 fair value. The unobservable inputs include historical volatilities and correlations for tolling arrangements and extrapolated values for certain power swaps. The valuation for this category is based on our judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability since limited market data exists. 
 The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and interest accrued approximate their estimated fair values and are considered as Level 1. 
 19 

The financial instruments measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, r  espectively, consisted of:  

The reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial instruments based on Level 3 inputs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is as follows: 

(a) Transfers out of Level 3 were the result of increased observability of market data.  
 For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization based on the lowest level of  
 20 

input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each r  eporting period. There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the periods reported.  
 Level 3 Fair Value Measurement 
 The tables below illustrate the significant sources of unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our Level 3 derivatives, and the variability in prices for those transactions classified as Level 3 derivatives.  

Our Level 3 valuations primarily consist of NYMEX gas and fixed price power swaps with delivery periods extending through 2024 and 2032, respectively. The gas swaps are used to hedge both gas inventory in firm storage and merchant wind positions. The power swaps are used to hedge merchant wind production in the West and Midwest. 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis around the Level 3 gas and power positions to changes in the valuation inputs. Given the nature of the transactions in Level 3, the only material input to the valuation is the market price of gas or power for transactions with delivery periods exceeding two years. The fixed price power swaps are economic hedges of future power generation, with decreases in power prices resulting in unrealized gains and increases in power prices resulting in unrealized losses. The gas swaps are economic hedges of gas storage inventory and merchant generation, with decreases in gas prices resulting in unrealized gains and increases in gas prices resulting in unrealized losses. As all transactions are economic hedges of the underlying position, any changes in the fair value of these transactions will be offset by changes in the anticipated purchase/sales price of the underlying commodity. 
 Two elements of the analytical infrastructure employed in valuing transactions are the price curves used in calculation of market value and the models themselves. We maintain and document authorized trading points and associated forward price curves, and we develop and document models used in valuation of the various products. 
 Transactions are valued in part on the basis of forward price, correlation, and volatility curves. We maintain and document descriptions of these curves and their derivations. Forward price curves used in valuing the transactions are applied to the full duration of the transaction. 
 The determination of fair value of the CfDs (see Note 7 for further details on CfDs) was based on a probability-based expected cash flow analysis that was discounted at risk-free interest rates, as applicable, and an adjustment for non-performance risk using credit default swap rates. Certain management assumptions were required, including development of pricing that extended over the term of the contracts. We believe this methodology provides the most reasonable estimates of the amount of future discounted cash flows associated with the CfDs. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we perform analytics to ensure that the fair value of the derivatives is consistent with changes, if any, in the various fair value model inputs. Significant isolated changes in the risk of non-performance, the discount rate or the contract term pricing would result in an inverse change in the fair value of the CfDs. Additional quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements of the CfDs is as follows: 

21 

Fair Value of Debt  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 debt consisted of first mortgage bonds, fixed and variable unsecured pollution control notes, other various non-current debt securities and obligations under capital leases. The estimated fair value of debt amounted to $5,240 million and $4,985 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The estimated fair value was determined, in most cases, by discounting the future cash flows at market interest rates. The interest rates used to make these calculations take into account the risks associated with the electricity industry and the credit ratings of the borrowers in each case. The fair value hierarchy pertaining to the fair value of debt is considered as Level 2, except for unsecured pollution control notes-variable with a fair value of $204 million as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which are considered Level 3. The fair value of these unsecured pollution control notes-variable are determined using unobservable interest rates as the market for these notes is inactive. 

Note 7. Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
 Our Networks, Renewables and Gas activities are exposed to certain risks, which are managed by using derivative instruments. All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the accounting requirements concerning derivative instruments and hedging activities. 
 (a) Networks activities 
 NYSEG and RGE have an electric commodity charge that passes through rates costs for the market price of electricity. They use electricity contracts, both physical and financial, to manage fluctuations in electricity commodity prices in order to provide price stability to customers. We include the cost or benefit of those contracts in the amount expensed for electricity purchased when the related electricity is sold. We record changes in the fair value of electric hedge contracts to derivative assets and / or liabilities with an offset to regulatory assets and / or regulatory liabilities, in accordance with the accounting requirements concerning regulated operations. 
 The amount recognized in regulatory assets for electricity derivatives was a loss of $16.2 million as of September 30, 2016, and $34.3 million as of December 31, 2015. The amount reclassified from regulatory assets and liabilities into income, which is included in electricity purchased, was a loss of $3.5 million and $51.4 million, and a loss of $14.8 million and $27.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 NYSEG and RGE have purchased gas adjustment clauses that allow them to recover through rates any changes in the market price of purchased natural gas, substantially eliminating their exposure to natural gas price risk. NYSEG and RGE use natural gas futures and forwards to manage fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices to provide price stability to customers. We include the cost or benefit of natural gas futures and forwards in the commodity cost that is passed on to customers when the related sales commitments are fulfilled. We record changes in the fair value of natural gas hedge contracts to derivative assets and / or liabilities with an offset to regulatory assets and / or regulatory liabilities in accordance with the accounting requirements for regulated operations. 
 The amount recognized in regulatory assets for natural gas hedges was a gain of $1.9 million as of September 30, 2016, and a loss of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2015. The amount reclassified from regulatory assets into income, which is included in natural gas purchased, was $0 and a loss of $3.4 million, and $0 and a loss of $3.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Pursuant to PURA, UI and Connecticut s other electric utility, The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL P), each executed two long-term CfDs with certain incremental capacity resources, each of which specifies a capacity quantity and a monthly settlement that reflects the difference between a forward market price and the contract price. The costs or benefits of each contract will be paid by or allocated to customers and will be subject to a cost-sharing agreement between UI and CL P pursuant to which approximately 20% of the cost or benefit is borne by or allocated to UI customers and approximately 80% is borne by or allocated to CL P customers. 
 PURA has determined that costs associated with these CfDs will be fully recoverable by UI and CL P through electric rates, and UI has deferred recognition of costs (a regulatory asset) or obligations (a regulatory liability). For those CfDs signed by CL P, UI records its approximate 20% portion pursuant to the cost-sharing agreement noted above. As of September 30, 2016, UI has recorded a gross derivative asset of $22 million ($0 of which is related to UI s portion of the CfD signed by CL P), a regulatory asset of $84 million, a gross derivative liability of $107 million ($79 million of which is related to UI s portion of the CfD signed by CL P) and a regulatory liability of $1 million. As of December 31, 2015, UI had recorded a gross derivative asset of $29 million ($1 million of which is related to UI s portion of the CfD signed by CL P), a regulatory asset of $68 million, a gross derivative liability of $96 million ($61 million of which is related to UI s portion of the CfD signed by CL P) and a regulatory liability of $1 million.

(a) Changes in OCI are reported on a pre-tax basis. The reclassified amounts of commodity contracts are included  within  Purchase power, natural gas and fuel used  line item within operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 The net loss in accumulated OCI related to previously settled forward starting swaps and accumulated amortization is $78.8 million and $84.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We recorded $2.0 million and $2.2 million in net derivative losses related to discontinued cash flow hedges for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recorded $6.0 million and $6.5 million in net derivative losses related to discontinued cash flow hedges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively We will amortize approximately $8.0 million of discontinued cash flow hedges in 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no ineffective portion for cash flow hedges. 
 The unrealized loss of $1.0 million on hedge activities is reported in OCI because the forecasted transaction is considered to be probable as of September 30, 2016. We expect that $0.8 million of those losses will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted fleet fuel transactions is fifteen months. 
 (b) Renewables and Gas activities 
 We sell fixed-price gas and power forwards to hedge our merchant wind assets from declining commodity prices for our Renewables business. We also purchase fixed-price gas and basis swaps and sell fixed-price power in the forward market to hedge the spark spread or heat rate of our merchant thermal assets. We also enter into tolling arrangements to sell the output of our thermal generation facilities. 
 Our gas business purchases and sells both fixed-price gas and basis swaps to hedge the value of contracted storage positions. The intent of entering into these swaps is to fix the margin of gas injected into storage for subsequent resale in future periods. We also enter into basis swaps to hedge the value of our contracted transport positions. The intent of buying and selling these basis swaps is to fix the location differential between the price of gas at the receipt and delivery point of the contracted transport in future periods. 
 24 

Both Renewables and Gas have proprietary trading operations that enter into fixed-price power and gas forwards in addition to basis swaps. The intent is to speculate on fixed-price commodity and basis volatility in the U.S. com  modity markets.  
 Renewables will periodically designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges for both its thermal and wind portfolios. To the extent that the derivative contracts are effective in offsetting the variability of cash flows associated with future power sales and gas purchases, the fair value changes are recorded in OCI. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in current period earnings. For thermal operations, Renewables will periodically designate both fixed price NYMEX gas contracts and AECO basis swaps that hedge the fuel requirements of its Klamath facility. Renewables will also designate fixed price power swaps at various locations in the U.S. market to hedge future power sales from its Klamath facility and various wind farms. 
 Gas also periodically designates NYMEX fixed price derivative contracts as cash flow hedges related to its firm storage trading activities. To the extent that the derivative contracts are effective in offsetting the variability of cash flows associated with future gas sales and purchases, the fair value changes are recorded in OCI. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in current period earnings. Derivative contracts entered into to hedge the gas transport trading activities are not designated as cash flow hedges, with all changes in fair value of such derivative contracts recorded in current period earnings. 
 The net notional volumes of outstanding derivative instruments associated with Renewables and Gas activities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

The fair values of derivative contracts associated with Renewables and Gas activities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consisted of:

 Changes in OCI are reported on a pre-tax basis.    

 Amounts will be reclassified from accumulated OCI into income in the period(s) during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings or when it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction being hedged would not occur. Notwithstanding future changes in prices, approximately $16.0 million of losses included in accumulated OCI at September 30, 2016, is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a net gain of $0.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in earnings as a result of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a net loss of $4.4 million and a net gain of $1.8 million, respectively, in earnings as a result of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges. 
 (c) Counterparty credit risk management 
 NYSEG and RGE face risks related to counterparty performance on hedging contracts due to counterparty credit default. We have developed a matrix of unsecured credit thresholds that are dependent on the counterparty s or the counterparty s guarantor s applicable credit rating, normally Moody s or Standard   Poor s. When our exposure to risk for a counterparty exceeds the unsecured credit threshold, the counterparty is required to post additional collateral or we will no longer transact with the counterparty until the exposure drops below the unsecured credit threshold. 
 The wholesale power supply agreements of UI contain default provisions that include required performance assurance, including certain collateral obligations, in the event that UI s credit rating on senior debt were to fall below investment grade. If such an event had occurred as of September 30, 2016, UI would have had to post an aggregate of approximately $9.6 million in collateral. 
 We have various master netting arrangements in the form of multiple contracts with various single counterparties that are subject to contractual agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment. Those arrangements reduce our exposure to a counterparty in the event of default on or termination of any single contract. For financial statement presentation purposes, we offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. The amounts of cash collateral under master netting arrangements that have not been offset against net derivative positions were $13 million and $11 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Derivative instruments settlements and collateral payments are included in  Other assets  and  Other liabilities  of operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 27 

Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major credit rating agenci  es. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, we would be in violation of those provisions and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on deriv  ative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features that are in a liability position as of September 30, 2016 is $16 million, for which we have posted collateral.  

Note 8. Contingencies 
 We are party to various legal disputes arising as part of our normal business activities. We do not provide for accrual of legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency. 
 MNG Rate Case 
 On March 5, 2015, MNG filed a rate case in order to further recover future investments and provide safe and adequate service.  MNG requested a 10.0% ROE and 50.0% equity ratio. The MPUC Staff recommended a separate revenue requirement for MNG s Augusta customers and MNG s non-Augusta customers. The Staff also recommended a $19.95 million disallowance of the Augusta Expansion investment based upon the Staff s conclusion that MNG s management of the Augusta Expansion Project was imprudent. 
 On November 6, 2015, a stipulation was filed with the MPUC, which was executed by MNG, the Office of Public Advocate and the City of Augusta. The stipulation contained a combined revenue requirement for Augusta and non-Augusta based on a 9.55% ROE and 50% equity ratio. The stipulation also provided for an initial Augusta investment disallowance of $6 million and an investment phase-in of $10 million. On December 22, 2015, the MPUC rejected the proposed stipulation as not in the public interest. In January 2016, the Administrative Law Judge established a new litigation schedule. The litigation was suspended at the end of January 2016 for settlement discussions. We reserved $6 million for this case at the end of 2015. 
 On May 3, 2016, all active parties to the case filed a stipulation that settled all matters at issue in the case and reflected a 10-year rate plan through April 30, 2026. The MPUC approved the stipulation on May 17, 2016, for new rates effective June 1, 2016. The settlement structure for non-Augusta customers includes a 34.6% delivery revenue increase over five years with an allowed 9.55% ROE and 50% common equity ratio. The settlement structure for Augusta customers includes a 10-year rate plan with existing Augusta customers being charged rates equal to non-Augusta customers plus a surcharge that increases annually for five years.  New Augusta customers will have rates set based on an alternate fuel market model. In year seven of the rate plan MNG will submit a cost of service filing for the Augusta area to determine if the rate plan should continue. This cost of service filing will exclude $15 million of initial 2012/2013 gross plant investment, however the stipulation allows for accelerated depreciation of these assets. If the Augusta area s cost of service filing illustrates results above a 14.55% ROE then the rate plan may cease, otherwise the rate plan would continue. A disallowance for the initial 2012/2013 gross plant investment is not part of the approved stipulation. The reserve of $6 million for this case was reversed in May 2016.        
 Transmission - ROE Complaint   CMP and UI 
 On September 30, 2011, the Massachusetts Attorney General, Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, Vermont Department of Public Service, numerous New England consumer advocate agencies and transmission tariff customers collectively filed a complaint (Complaint I) with the FERC pursuant to sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act. The filing parties seek an order from the FERC reducing the 11.14% base return on equity (ROE) used in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-New England Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) to 9.2%. CMP and UI are New England Transmission Owners (NETOs) with assets and service rates that are governed by the OATT and will thereby be affected by any FERC order resulting from the filed complaint. 
 On June 19, 2014, the FERC issued its decision in Complaint I, establishing a methodology and setting an issue for a paper hearing.  On October 16, 2014, FERC issued its final decision in the Complaint I setting the base ROE at 10.57% and a maximum total ROE of 11.74% (base plus incentive ROEs) for the October 2011   December 2012 period as well as prospectively from October 16, 2014, and ordered the NETOs to file a refund report. On November 17, 2014, the NETOs filed a refund report. 
 On March 3, 2015, the FERC issued an order on requests for rehearing of its October 16, 2014 decision. The March order upheld the FERC s June 19, 2014 decision and further clarified that the 11.74% ROE cap will be applied on a project specific basis and not on a transmission owner s total average return. In June 2015 the NETOs filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia of the FERC s final order. The appeal is currently pending, and we cannot predict the outcome of this appeal. 
 28 

On December 26, 2012, a second, ROE complaint (Complaint II) for a subse  quent rate period was filed requesting the ROE be reduced to 8.7%. On June 19, 2014, FERC accepted Complaint II, established a 15-month refund effective date of December 27, 2012, and set the matter for hearing using the methodology established in the Comp  laint I.  
 On July 31, 2014, a third ROE complaint (Complaint III) was filed for a subsequent rate period requesting the ROE be reduced to 8.84%. On November 24, 2014, FERC accepted the Complaint III, established a 15-month refund effective date of July 31, 2014, and set this matter, consolidated with Complaint II, for hearing in June 2015. Hearings were held in June 2015 on Complaints II and III before a FERC Administrative Law Judge, relating to the refund periods and going forward period. On July 29, 2015, post-hearing briefs were filed by parties and on August 26, 2015 reply briefs were filed by parties. On July 13, 2015, the NETOs filed a petition for review of FERC s orders establishing hearing and consolidation procedures for Complaints II and III with the U.S. Court of Appeals. The FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Decision on March 22, 2016.  The Initial Decision determined that, 1) for the 15-month refund period in Complaint II, the base ROE should be 9.59% and that the ROE Cap (base ROE plus incentive ROEs) should be 10.42% and 2) for the 15-month refund period in Complaint III and prospectively, the base ROE should be 10.90% and that the ROE Cap should be 12.19%. The Initial Decision is the Administrative Law Judge s recommendation to the FERC Commissioners.  The FERC is expected to make its final decision in late 2016 or early 2017. 
 CMP and UI reserved for refunds for Complaints I, II and III consistent with the FERC s March 3, 2015 final decision in Complaint I. The CMP and UI total reserve associated with Complaints I, II and III is $21.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. If adopted as final, the impact of the initial decision would be an additional aggregate reserve for Complaints II and III of $17.1 million pretax and $10.2 million, net of tax, which is based upon currently available information for these proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of the Complaint II and III proceedings. 
 On April 29, 2016, a fourth ROE complaint (Complaint IV) was filed for a rate period subsequent to prior complaints requesting the base ROE be 8.61% and ROE Cap be 11.24%.  The NETOs filed a response to the Complaint IV on June 3, 2016. On September 20, 2016, FERC accepted the Complaint IV, established a 15-month refund effective date of April 29, 2016, and set the matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures. A range of possible outcomes is not able to be determined at this time due to the preliminary state of this matter. We cannot predict the outcome of the Complaint IV proceeding.  
 Yankee Nuclear Spent Fuel Disposal Claim 
 CMP has an ownership interest in Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, and Yankee Atomic Electric Company (the Yankee Companies), three New England single-unit decommissioned nuclear reactor sites, and UI has an ownership interest in Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company. Every six years, pursuant to the statute of limitations, the Yankee Companies file a lawsuit to recover damages from the Department of Energy (DOE or Government) for breach of the Nuclear Spent Fuel Disposal Contract to remove Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) and Greater than Class C Waste (GTCC) as required by contract and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act beginning in 1998. The damages are the incremental costs for the Government s failure to take the spent nuclear fuel.   
 In 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a favorable decision in the Yankee Companies  claim for the first six year period (Phase I).  Total damages awarded to the Yankee Companies were nearly $160 million.  The Yankee Companies won on all appellate points in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit s unanimous decision.  The Federal Appeals Court affirmed the September 2010 U.S. Court of Federal Claims award of $39.7 million to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company; affirmed the Court of Federal Claims award of $81.7 million to Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company; and increased Yankee Atomic Electric Company s damages award from $21.4 million to $38.3 million. The Phase I damage award became final on December 4, 2012. The Yankee Companies received payment from the DOE in January 2013. CMP s share of the award was approximately $36.5 million which was credited back to customers. UI s share of the award was $3.8 million which was credited back to customers. 
 In November 2013 the U.S. Court of Claims issued its decision in the Phase II case (the second 6-year period). The court s decision awarded the Yankee Companies a combined $235.4 million (Connecticut Yankee $126.3 million, Maine Yankee $37.7 million, and Yankee Atomic $73.3 million). The Phase II period covers January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2008, for Connecticut Yankee and Yankee Atomic, and January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008, for Maine Yankee. Maine Yankee s damage award was lower because it recovered a larger amount in the Phase I case ($82 million) and its decommissioning was both less expensive and completed sooner than the other Yankee Companies.  The damage awards flow through the Yankee Companies to shareholders (including CMP and UI) to reduce retail customer charges.  In January 2014 the Government informed the Yankee Companies it would not appeal the court s decision. As a result the Yankee Companies received full payment in April 2014. CMP s share of the award was approximately $28.2 million which was credited back to customers. UI received approximately $12 million of such award which was applied, in part, against its remaining storm regulatory asset balance. The remaining regulatory liability balance was applied to UI s generation service charge (GSC)  working capital allowance  and was returned to customers through the non-by-passable federally mandated congestion charge. 
 29 

In August 2013, the Yankee Companies filed a third round of claims against the Go  vernment seeking damages for the years 2009-2014 (Phase III). The Phase III trial was completed in July 2015 and the court issued its decision on March 25, 2016, awarding the Yankee Companies a combined $76.8 million (Connecticut Yankee $32.6 million, Main  e Yankee $24.6 million and Yankee Atomic $19.6 million). The damage awards, less any amount retained to reduce future customer charges, will potentially flow through the Yankee Companies to shareholders, including CMP and UI, upon FERC approval, and will r  educe retail customer charges or otherwise as specified by law. CMP and UI will receive their proportionate share of the awards that flow through based on percentage ownership. On July 18, 2016, the notice of appeal period expired and the Phase III trial a  ward became final. On October 14, 2016, the Yankee Companies received the Government's payment of the damage award. We cannot predict the timing or amount of damage awards that may ultimately flow through to customers.  
 NYPSC Staff Review of Earnings Sharing Calculations and Other Regulatory Deferrals 
 In December 2012, the NYPSC Staff (Staff) informed NYSEG and RGE that the Staff had conducted an audit of the companies  annual compliance filings (ACF) for 2009 through August 31, 2010, and the first rate year of the current rate plan, September 1, 2010 through August 31, 2011. The Staff s preliminary findings indicated adjustments to deferred balances primarily associated with storm costs and the treatment of certain incentive compensation costs for purposes of the 2011 ACF. The Staff s findings approximate $9.8 million of adjustments to deferral balances and customer earnings sharing accruals. NYSEG and RGE reviewed the Staff s adjustments and work papers and provided a response in early 2013. NYSEG and RGE disagreed with certain Staff conclusions and as a result recorded a $3.4 million reserve in December 2012 in anticipation of settling the Staff issues. In the Proposal approved by the NYPSC (see Note 5) the parties agreed that in full and final resolution of all years through 2012, and in full and final resolution of storm-related deferrals through 2014, the companies will add $2.4 million to the customer share of earnings sharing. 
 California Energy Crisis Litigation 
 Two California agencies brought a complaint against a long-term power purchase agreement entered into by Renewables, as seller, to the California Department of Water Resources, as purchaser, alleging that the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreement were unjust and unreasonable. FERC dismissed Renewables from the proceedings; however, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed FERC's dismissal of Renewables. 
 Joining with two other parties, Renewables filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court on May 3, 2007. In an order entered on June 27, 2008, the Supreme Court granted Renewables  petition for certiorari, vacated the appellate court's judgment, and remanded the case to the appellate court for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court s decision in a similar case. In light of the Supreme Court's order, on December 4, 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated its prior opinion and remanded the complaint proceedings to the FERC for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's rulings. In 2014 FERC assigned an administrative law judge to conduct evidentiary hearings. Following discovery, the FERC Trial Staff recommended that the complaint against Renewables be dismissed. 
 A hearing was held before an administrative law judge of FERC in November and early December 2015. A preliminary proposed ruling by the administrative law judge was issued on April 12, 2016.  The proposed ruling found no evidence that Renewables had engaged in any unlawful market contract that would justify finding the Renewables power purchase agreements unjust and unreasonable. However, the proposed ruling did conclude that the price of the power purchase agreements imposed an excessive burden on customers in the amount of $259 million. Renewables position, as presented at hearings and agreed by FERC Trial Staff, is that Renewables entered into bilateral power purchase contracts appropriately and complied with all applicable legal standards and requirements. The parties have submitted to FERC briefs on exceptions to the administrative law judge s proposed ruling. There is no specific timetable to FERC s ruling, but we presently expect it to be issued in late 2016. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
 Guarantee Commitments to Third Parties 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $2.7 billion of standby letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and indemnifications outstanding. These instruments provide financial assurance to the business and trading partners of AVANGRID and its subsidiaries in their normal course of business.  The instruments only represent liabilities if AVANGRID or its subsidiaries fail to deliver on contractual obligations. We therefore believe it is unlikely that any material liabilities associated with these instruments will be incurred and, accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, neither we nor our subsidiaries have any liabilities recorded for these instruments. 
   
 30 

Note 9. Environmental Liabilities  
 Environmental laws, regulations and compliance programs may occasionally require changes in our operations and facilities and may increase the cost of electric and natural gas service. We do not provide for accruals of legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies. 
 Waste sites 
 The Environmental Protection Agency and various state environmental agencies, as appropriate, have notified us that we are among the potentially responsible parties that may be liable for costs incurred to remediate certain hazardous substances at twenty-four waste sites, which do not include sites where gas was manufactured in the past. Fifteen of the twenty-four sites are included in the New York State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites; six sites are included in Maine s Uncontrolled Sites Program and one site is included on the Massachusetts Non- Priority Confirmed Disposal Site list. The remaining sites are not included in any registry list. Finally, nine of the twenty-four sites are also included on the National Priorities list. Any liability may be joint and severable for certain sites. 
 We have recorded an estimated liability of $6 million related to ten of the twenty-four sites. We have paid remediation costs related to the remaining fourteen sites and do not expect to incur additional liabilities. Additionally, we have recorded an estimated liability of $8 million related to another ten sites where we believe it is probable that we will incur remediation costs and or monitoring costs, although we have not been notified that we are among the potentially responsible parties or that we are regulated under State Resource Conservation and Recovery Act programs. It is possible the ultimate cost to remediate these sites may be significantly more than the accrued amount. Factors affecting the estimated remediation amount include the remedial action plan selected, the extent of site contamination, and the portion of remediation attributed to us. 
 Manufactured Gas Plants 
 We have a program to investigate and perform necessary remediation at our fifty-three sites where gas was manufactured in the past (Manufactured Gas Plants, or MGPs). Eight sites are included in the New York State Registry; eleven sites are included in the New York Voluntary Cleanup Program; three sites are part of Maine s Voluntary Response Action Program with two of such sites being part of Maine s Uncontrolled Sites Program. The remaining sites are not included in any registry list. We have entered into consent orders with various environmental agencies to investigate and where necessary remediate forty-seven of the fifty-three sites. 
 Our estimate for all costs related to investigation and remediation of the fifty-three sites ranges from $235 million to $468 million as of September 30, 2016. Our estimate could change materially based on facts and circumstances derived from site investigations, changes in required remedial actions, changes in technology relating to remedial alternatives, and changes to current laws and regulations.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the liability associated with MGP sites in Connecticut, the remediation costs of which could be significant and will be subject to a review by PURA as to whether these costs are recoverable in rates, was $99 million. 
 The liability to investigate and perform remediation at the known inactive MGP sites was $382 million and $397 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We recorded a corresponding regulatory asset, net of insurance recoveries and the amount collected from FirstEnergy, as described below, because we expect to recover the net costs in rates. Our environmental liability accruals are recorded on an undiscounted basis and are expected to be paid through the year 2048. 
 Certain other Connecticut and Massachusetts regulated gas companies own or have previously owned properties where MGPs had historically operated. MGP operations have led to contamination of soil and groundwater with petroleum hydrocarbons, benzene and metals, among other things, at these properties, the regulation and cleanup of which is regulated by the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations. Each of the companies has or had an ownership interest in one or more such properties contaminated as a result of MGP-related activities. Under the existing regulations, the cleanup of such sites requires state and at times, federal, regulators  involvement and approval before cleanup can commence. In certain cases, such contamination has been evaluated, characterized and remediated. In other cases, the sites have been evaluated and characterized, but not yet remediated. Finally, at some of these sites, the scope of the contamination has not yet been fully characterized; no liability was recorded in respect of these sites as of September 30, 2016 and no amount of loss, if any, can be reasonably estimated at this time. In the past, the companies have received approval for the recovery of MGP-related remediation expenses from customers through rates and will seek recovery in rates for ongoing MGP-related remediation expenses for all of their MGP sites.

FirstEnergy  
 NYSEG sued FirstEnergy under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to recover environmental cleanup costs at sixteen former manufactured gas sites, which are included in the discussion above. In July 2011, the District Court issued a decision and order in NYSEG s favor. Based on past and future clean-up costs at the sixteen sites in dispute, FirstEnergy would be required to pay NYSEG approximately $60 million if the decision were upheld on appeal. On September 9, 2011, FirstEnergy paid NYSEG $30 million, representing their share of past costs of $27 million and pre-judgment interest of $3 million. 
 FirstEnergy appealed the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On September 11, 2014, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court s decision in NYSEG s favor, but modified the decision for nine sites, reducing NYSEG s damages for incurred costs from $27 million to $22 million, excluding interest, and reducing FirstEnergy s allocable share of future costs at these sites. NYSEG refunded FirstEnergy the excess $5 million in November 2014. 
 FirstEnergy remains liable for a substantial share of clean up expenses at nine MPG sites. In January 2015, NYSEG sent FirstEnergy a demand for $16 million representing FirstEnergy s share of clean-up expenses incurred by NYSEG at the nine sites from January 2010 to November 2014 while the District Court appeal was pending. Nearly all of this amount has been paid by FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy would also be liable for a share of post 2014 costs, which, based on current projections, would be $26 million. This amount is being treated as a contingent asset and has not been recorded as either a receivable or a decrease to the environmental provision. Any recovery will be flowed through to NYSEG ratepayers. 
 Century Indemnity and OneBeacon 
 On August 14, 2013, NYSEG filed suit in federal court against two excess insurers, Century Indemnity and OneBeacon, who provided excess liability coverage to NYSEG. NYSEG seeks payment for clean-up costs associated with contamination at twenty-two former manufactured gas plants. Based on estimated clean-up costs of $282 million, the carriers  allocable share could equal or exceed approximately $89 million, excluding pre-judgment interest, although this amount may change substantially depending upon the determination of various factual matters and legal issues during the case.  
 Century and One Beacon have answered admitting issuance of the excess policies, but contesting coverage and providing documentation proving they received notice of the claims in the 1990s. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter, however, any recovery will be flowed through to NYSEG ratepayers. 
 English Station 
 In January 2012, Evergreen Power, LLC (Evergreen Power) and Asnat Realty LLC (Asnat), then and current owners of a former generation site on the Mill River in New Haven (the English Station site) that UI sold to Quinnipiac Energy in 2000, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Connecticut against UI seeking, among other things: (i) an order directing UI to reimburse the plaintiffs for costs they have incurred and will incur for the testing, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances at the English Station site and (ii) an order directing UI to investigate and remediate the site. In December 2013, Evergreen and Asnat filed a subsequent lawsuit in Connecticut state court seeking among other things: (i) remediation of the property; (ii) reimbursement of remediation costs; (iii) termination of UI s easement rights; (iv) reimbursement for costs associated with securing the property; and (v) punitive damages.  
 On April 8, 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) issued an administrative order addressed to UI, Evergreen Power, Asnat and others, ordering the parties to take certain actions related to investigating and remediating the English Station site. Mediation of the matter began in the fourth quarter of 2013 and concluded unsuccessfully in April 2015. Action in the administrative proceeding has been stayed to allow additional time for settlement discussions. 
 On August 4, 2016, DEEP issued a Partial Consent Order that, subject to its terms and conditions, requires UI to investigate and remediate certain environmental conditions within the perimeter of the English Station site. Under the Partial Consent Order, to the extent that the cost of this investigation and remediation is less than $30 million, UI will remit to the State of Connecticut the difference between such cost and $30 million to be used for a public purpose as determined in the discretion of the Governor of the State of Connecticut, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, and the Commissioner of DEEP. UI is obligated to comply with the terms of the Partial Consent Order even if the cost of such compliance exceeds $30 million. Under the terms of the Partial Consent Order, the State will discuss options with UI on recovering or funding any cost above $30 million such as through public funding or recovery from third parties; however, it is not bound to agree to or support any means of recovery or funding.       
 32 

In connection with the Partial Consent Order, on August 4, 2016, DEEP also issued  a Consent Order to Evergreen Power, Asnat, and certain related parties that provides UI access to investigate and remediate   the English Station site consistent with the Partial Consent Order. UI has initiated its process to investigate and remediate the environmental conditions within the perimeter of the English Station site pursuant to the Partial Consent Order.  
 As of December 31, 2015, we reserved $20.5 million for this case and have accrued the remaining $9.5 million in accordance with the settlement with PURA approving the acquisition. As of September 30, 2016, the reserve amount remained unchanged. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
   
 Note 10. Post-retirement and Similar Obligations 
 We made $29 million and $44 million of pension contributions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. We do not expect to make additional contributions for the remainder of 2016. 
 The components of net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

The components of net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

Note 11. Equity 
 As of September 30, 2016, our share capital consisted of 500,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, 309,592,620 shares issued and 309,003,589 shares outstanding, 81.5% of which is owned by Iberdrola, each having a par value of $0.01, for a total value of common stock capital of $3 million and additional paid in capital of $13,652 million. As of December 31, 2015, our share capital consisted of 500,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, 309,491,082 shares issued and 308,864,609 shares outstanding, 81.5% of which is owned by Iberdrola, each having a par value of $0.01, for a total value of common stock capital of $3 million and additional paid in capital of $13,653 million. We had 491,552 and 626,473 shares of common stock held in trust and no convertible preferred shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 101,538 shares of common stock and released 134,921 shares of common stock held in trust each having a par value of $0.01.  
 On April 28, 2016, we entered into a repurchase agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC. (JPM), pursuant to which JPM will, from time to time, acquire, on behalf of AVANGRID, shares of common stock of AVANGRID. The purpose of the stock repurchase program is to allow AVANGRID to maintain the relative ownership percentage of Iberdrola at 81.5%. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time upon notice. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased  
 33 

97,479 shares of common stock of AVANGRID in the open market. The total cost of repurchase, including commissions, was $4 million.  
 On December 15, 2015, the Board of Directors approved our common stock dividend, accounted for as a stock split. The stock split, effected through a stock dividend, resulted in the issuance of 252,234,989 shares, which in addition to the 243 previously existing shares increased the total shares outstanding to 252,235,232. The stock dividend was effective upon the Board s approval. All share and per share information included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock dividend.  
 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Accumulated OCI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

Accumulated OCI for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

(a)   
 
 Reclassification is reflected in the operating expenses line item in the condensed consolidated statements of income.    

Note 12. Earnings Per Share 
 Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to AVANGRID by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, while we did have securities that  
 34 

were dilutive, these securities did not result in a change in our earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. We did not have any potenti  ally-dilutive securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. In accordance with   Accounting Standards Codification   (ASC) Topic 260, Earnings per Share, we retroactively applied the stock split to the prior period.  
 The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to AVANGRID, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

Note 13. Segment Information 
 Our segment reporting structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how AVANGRID manages the business internally and is organized by type of business. We report our financial performance based on the following three reportable segments: 

Networks: including all the energy transmission and distribution activities, and any other regulated activity originating in New York and Maine, and regulated electric distribution, electric transmission and gas distribution activities originating in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The Networks reportable segment includes eight rate regulated operating segments. These operating segments generally offer the same services distributed in similar fashions, have the same types of customers, have similar long-term economic characteristics and are subject to similar regulatory requirements, allowing these operations to be aggregated into one reportable segment.     

Renewables: activities relating to renewable energy, mainly wind energy generation and trading related with such activities.     

Gas: including gas trading and storage businesses carried on by the AVANGRID Group.     

 Products and services are sold between reportable segments and affiliate companies at cost. The chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance based on segment adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) defined as net income adding back net income attributable to other noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of non-current assets and interest expense net of capitalization, and then subtracting other income and (expense) and earnings from equity method investments per segment. Segment income, expense, and assets presented in the accompanying tables include all intercompany transactions that are eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 14. Related Party Transactions 
 We engage in related party transactions that are generally billed at cost and in accordance with applicable state and federal commission regulations. 
 Related party transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

37 

Related party transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisted of:  

In addition to the statements of income items above, we made purchases of turbines for wind farms from Gamesa Corporaci n Tecnol gica, S.A. (Gamesa), in which our ultimate parent, Iberdrola, has a 20% ownership. The amounts capitalized for these transactions were $193 million and $70 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In June 2016, Siemens AG and Gamesa signed binding agreement to merge wind power business. After completion of the merger, which is expected in the first quarter of 2017, Iberdrola will have 8.1% ownership of the new combined company.   
 Related party balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consisted of: 

Transactions with our parent company, Iberdrola, relate predominantly to the provision of and allocation of corporate services and management fees. Also included within the Purchases From category are charges for credit support relating to guarantees Iberdrola has provided to third parties guaranteeing our performance. All costs that can be specifically allocated, to the extent possible, are charged directly to the company receiving such services. In situations when Iberdrola corporate services are provided to two or more companies of AVANGRID any costs remaining after direct charge are allocated using agreed upon cost allocation methods designed to allocate those costs. We believe that the allocation method used is reasonable. 
 Transactions with Iberdrola Canada Energy Services predominantly relate to the purchase of gas for ARHI s gas-fired generation facility at Klamath. 
 There have been no guarantees provided or received for any related party receivables or payables. These balances are unsecured and are typically settled in cash. Interest is not charged on regular business transactions but is charged on outstanding loan balances. There have been no impairments or provisions made against any affiliated balances, other than $3 million and $10 million write-offs related to an arrangement to purchase turbines from Gamesa during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which was recorded in impairment of non-current assets in the condensed consolidated statements of income. The collectability of amounts receivable from Gamesa are contingent upon other related parties fulfilling certain payments to Gamesa. 
 Networks holds an approximate 20% ownership interest in the regulated New York TransCo, LLC (New York TransCo). Through New York TransCo, Networks has formed a partnership with Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, Consolidated Edison, Inc., National Grid, plc and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. to develop a portfolio of interconnected transmission lines and substations to fulfill the objectives of the New York energy highway initiative, which is a proposal to install up to 3,200 MW of new electric generation and transmission capacity in order to deliver more power generated from upstate New York power plants to downstate New York. In the second quarter of 2016, Networks has increased its equity method investment in the New York TransCo by approximately $21 million (included in  Other investments and equity method investments, net  of investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows) for a total equity method investment of $22 million. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, Networks received approximately $67 million from the New York TransCo in the form of $43 million for assets constructed and transferred to the New York TransCo (included in  Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment  of investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows), $22 million in contributions in aid of construction and approximately $2 million in advanced lease payments for a 99 year lease of land and attachment rights. As of September 30, 2016 the amount receivable from New York TransCo was $10 million. 
 AVANGRID manages its overall liquidity position as part of the broader Iberdrola Group and is a party to a notional cash pooling agreement with Bank Mendes Gans, N.V., similar to other Iberdrola subsidiaries.  Cash surpluses remaining after meeting the liquidity requirements of AVANGRID and its subsidiaries may be deposited in the cash pooling account where such funds are available to meet the liquidity needs of other affiliates within the Iberdrola Group. Under the cash pooling agreement, affiliates with credit balances have pledged those balances to cover the debit balances of the other affiliated parties to the agreement.

Note 15. Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable include amounts due under deferred payment arrangements (DPA). A DPA allows the account balance to be paid in installments over an extended period of time, which generally exceeds one year, by negotiating mutually acceptable payment terms and not bearing interest. The utility company generally must continue to serve a customer who cannot pay an account balance in full if the customer (i) pays a reasonable portion of the balance; (ii) agrees to pay the balance in installments; and (iii) agrees to pay future bills within thirty days until the DPA is paid in full. Failure to make payments on a DPA results in the full amount of a receivable under a DPA being due. These accounts are part of the regular operating cycle and are classified as current. 
 We establish provisions for uncollectible accounts for DPAs by using both historical average loss percentages to project future losses and by establishing specific provisions for known credit issues. Amounts are written off when reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. DPA receivable balances were $57 million and $62 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts for DPAs at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $32 million and $35 million, respectively. Furthermore, the provision for bad debts associated with the DPAs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(2) and $5 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(3) million and $1 million, respectively. 

Note 16. Income Tax Expense 
 The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were 32.7% and 43.8%, respectively, which are different from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate predominantly due to the impact of an adjustment of $126 million to unfunded future income tax to reflect the change from a flow through to normalization method following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC, which was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as an increase to income tax expense and an offsetting increase to revenue, the sale of the Iroquois equity investment in the same period partially offset by the recognition of production tax credits associated with wind production in both periods. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, were 50.9% and 37.6%, respectively, which are different from the 35% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income tax expenses, partially offset by the recognition of production tax credits associated with wind production in both periods. 
   
 Note 17. Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 Under the Avangrid, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan 1,298,683 performance stock units (PSUs) were granted to certain officers and employees of AVANGRID in July 2016. The PSUs will vest upon achievement of certain performance- and market-based metrics related to the 2016 through 2019 plan and will be payable in three equal installments in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The fair value of the PSUs on the grant date was $31.80 per share, which is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of approximately seven years based on expected achievement. 
 For the purpose of accounting for the above plan, in the third quarter of 2016 we early adopted all the amendments to ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, issued in March 2016 and elected to account for forfeitures when they occur.  
 The total stock-based compensation expense, which is included in operations and maintenance of the condensed consolidated statements of income, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $1 million.

Item 2    . Mana  gement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited combined and consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the three years ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on April 1, 2016, which we refer to as our  Form 10-K.  In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. The foregoing and other factors are discussed and should be reviewed in our Form 10-K and other subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 Overview 
 We are a direct, majority-owned subsidiary of Iberdrola, S.A., or Iberdrola, a corporation  (sociedad an nima)  organized under the laws of The Kingdom of Spain, one of the world s leading energy companies.  Our direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries include Avangrid Networks, Inc., or Networks, and Avangrid Renewables Holdings, Inc., or ARHI. ARHI in turn holds subsidiaries including Avangrid Renewables LLC, or Renewables, and Enstor Gas, LLC, or Gas. Networks, owns and operates our regulated utility businesses through its subsidiaries, including electric transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales. Avangrid Service Company, a subsidiary of Networks, provides corporate and back-office services on a consolidated basis to our subsidiaries. Renewables operates a portfolio of renewable energy generation facilities primarily using onshore wind power and also solar, biomass and thermal power.  Gas operates our natural gas storage facilities and gas trading businesses through Enstor Energy Services LLC (gas trading) and Enstor Inc. (gas storage). 
 On December 16, 2015, we completed our acquisition of UIL Holdings Corporation, or UIL. Immediately following the completion of the acquisition, former UIL shareowners owned 18.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of AVANGRID, and Iberdrola owned the remaining shares.  The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of UIL since December 16, 2015, the acquisition date, have been included in the consolidated results of AVANGRID. Effective as of April 30, 2016, UIL and its subsidiaries were transferred to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Networks. 
 Through Networks, we own electric generation, transmission and distribution companies and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales companies in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, delivering electricity to approximately 2.2 million electric utility customers and delivering natural gas to approximately 985,000 natural gas public utility customers as of September 30, 2016. 
 Networks, a Maine corporation, along with UIL, a Connecticut corporation, holds our regulated utility businesses, including electric transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales. Networks serves as a super-regional energy services and delivery company through eight regulated utilities it owns directly: 

New York State Electric   Gas Corporation, or NYSEG: serves electric and natural gas customers across more than 40% of the upstate New York geographic area;     

Rochester Gas and Electric, or RGE: serves electric and natural gas customers within a nine-county region in western New York, centered around Rochester;     

The United Illuminating Company, or UI: serves electric customers in southwestern Connecticut;     

Central Maine Power Company, or CMP: serves electric customers in central and southern Maine;     

The Southern Connecticut Gas Company, or SCG: serves natural gas customers in Connecticut;     

Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation, or CNG: serves natural gas customers in Connecticut;      

The Berkshire Gas Company, or BGC: serves natural gas customers in western Massachusetts; and     

Maine Natural Gas Corporation, or MNG: serves natural gas customers in several communities in central and southern Maine.     

 Through Renewables, we had a combined wind, solar and thermal operating capacity of 6,330 megawatts, or MW, as of September 30, 2016, including Renewables  share of joint projects, of which 5,643 MW was operating wind capacity. Approximately 62% of the capacity was contracted for an average period of 9.7 years as of September 30, 2016. As the second largest wind operator in the United States based on installed capacity as of September 30, 2016, Renewables strives to lead the transformation of the U.S. energy industry to a competitive, clean energy future. Renewables currently operates 53 wind farms in 18 states across the United States. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the production of wind was approximately 6% lower than the average wind  
 40 

produc  tion in 2011 through 2014. This decrease resulted in approximately $32 million to $38 million of lower adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) for Renewables. For additional information, please see the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year e  nded December 31, 2015.  
 Through Gas, as of September 30, 2016, we own approximately 67.5 billion cubic feet, or Bcf, of net working gas storage capacity. Gas operates 52.4 Bcf of contracted or managed natural gas storage capacity in North America through Enstor Energy Services, LLC, as of September 30, 2016. 
 Our operating revenues increased by 35%, from $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 The increase in operating revenues was largely due to the inclusion of UIL, which was not in the comparable period, adding $355 million in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Networks and Gas business revenues increased on the impact of favorable operating conditions partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market changes on derivatives and lower other revenues at Renewables. 
 Net income increased by 101% from $54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $109 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the additional contribution of UIL. Networks net income improved as higher electricity and gas revenues and New York rate case impacts occurred offset by increases in costs resulting from higher transmission support expense. Renewables net income decreased as a result of lower average prices and unfavorable mark-to-market changes on derivatives offset by favorable changes from the revision of estimated useful lives of wind power station assets. Gas net loss decreased due to favorable MtM changes on derivatives and transport contracts.  
 Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), increased by 28% from $327 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $420 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of a 137% increase in adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) at Networks due to the addition of UIL. Renewables decreased by 22%, primarily as a result of unfavorable mark-to-market changes on derivatives and lower production tax credits. Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) increased by 28%, from $795 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,033 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the addition of UIL, which added $228 million to adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) in the third quarter of 2016. For additional information and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to net income, see    Non-GAAP Financial Measures  . 
 See    Results of Operations   for further analysis of our operating results for the quarter. 
 Legislative and Regulatory Update 
 We are subject to complex and stringent energy, environmental and other laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels as well as rules within the independent system operator, or ISO, markets in which we participate. Federal and state legislative and regulatory actions continue to change how our business is regulated. We are actively participating in these debates at the federal, regional, state and ISO levels. Significant updates are discussed below. For a further discussion of the environmental and other governmental regulations that affect us, see our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 MNG rate case    
 On May 3, 2016, all active parties to the case filed a stipulation that settled all matters at issue in the case and reflected a 10-year rate plan through April 30, 2026. The MPUC approved the stipulation on May 17, 2016, for new rates effective June 1, 2016. The settlement structure for non-Augusta customers includes a 34.6% delivery revenue increase over five years with an allowed 9.55% ROE and 50% common equity ratio. The settlement structure for Augusta customers includes a 10-year rate plan with existing Augusta customers being charged rates equal to non-Augusta customers plus a surcharge which increases annually for five years.  New Augusta customers will have rates set based on an alternate fuel market model. In year seven of the rate plan MNG will submit a cost of service filing for the Augusta area to determine if the rate plan should continue. This cost of service filing will exclude $15 million of initial 2012/2013 gross plant investment, however the stipulation allows for accelerated depreciation of these assets. If the Augusta area s cost of service filing illustrates results above a 14.55% ROE then the rate plan may cease, otherwise the rate plan would continue. A disallowance for the initial 2012/2013 gross plant investment is not part of the approved stipulation. The reserve of $6 million for this case was reversed in May 2016. 
 41 

Transmission - ROE Complaint     
 On April 29, 2016, the Eastern Massachusetts Consumer Owned Systems filed a fourth, ROE complaint (Complaint IV) for a rate period subsequent to prior complaints requesting the base ROE be 8.61% and ROE Cap be 11.24%. The NETOs filed a response to the Complaint IV on June 3, 2016. On September 20, 2016, FERC accepted the Complaint IV, established a 15-month refund effective date of April 29, 2016, and set the matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures. A range of possible outcomes is not able to be determined at this time due to the preliminary state of this matter. We cannot predict the outcome of the Complaint IV proceeding.   
 NYSEG and RGE Joint Proposal Approval  
 On June 15, 2016, the New York State Public Service Commission (NYPSC) approved the Joint Proposal (Proposal) in connection with a three-year rate plan for electric and gas service at NYSEG and RGE effective May 1, 2016. Following the approval of the Proposal most of these items related to NYSEG are amortized over a five-year period, except the portion of storm costs to be recovered over ten years, plant related tax items which are amortized over the life of associated plant. Annual amortization expense for NYSEG is approximately $16.5 million per rate year. RGE items that are being amortized are plant related tax items, which are amortized over the life of associated plant, and unfunded deferred taxes being amortized over a period of fifty years. A majority of the other items related to RGE, which net to a regulatory liability, remains deferred and will not be amortized until future proceedings or will be used to recover costs of the Ginna Reliability Support Services Agreement (Ginna RSSA). 
 In the approved Proposal the allowed rate of return on common equity is 9.0% for all companies. The equity ratio for each company is 48%; however, the equity ratio is set at 50% for earnings sharing purposes. The customer share of any earnings above allowed levels increases as the ROE increases, with customers receiving 50%, 75% and 90% of earnings over 9.5%, 10.0% and 10.5% ROE, respectively, in the first year. The rate plans also include the implementation of a rate adjustment mechanism designed to return or collect certain defined reconciled revenues and costs; new depreciation rates; and continuation of the existing revenue decoupling mechanisms for each business. Following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC, unfunded future income taxes were adjusted for the amount of $126 million to reflect the change from a flow through to normalization method, which has been recorded as an increase to income tax expense and an offsetting increase to revenue during the second quarter of 2016. The amounts will be collected over a period of fifty years. 
 UI rate case    
 On July 1, 2016, UI filed an application with the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, requesting approval of a three-year rate plan commencing January 1, 2017, and extending through December 31, 2019. We expect PURA to rule on UI s rate request in December 2016. UI s application requests an increase of $65.6 million in 2017, an additional $21.1 million in 2018, and an additional $13.4 million in 2019, totaling $100.1 million over the three years. During the litigation of the case, the three-year cumulative request was modified to $98.3 million. The original application includes a rate levelization proposal to moderate the customer impact of the necessary revenue increases. The proposal defers a portion of the first and second year increases and spreads recovery of the overall increase by approximately equivalent amounts over the three years of the rate plan with carrying charges included. The proposal results in levelized revenue requirement increases of $40.7 million in 2017, $47.4 million in 2018 and $39.1 million in 2019, followed by an offset of $25.6 million at the end of the three year rate plan to equate the levelized recovery to the non-levelized revenue requirement increase. 
 UI s rate request is attributable primarily to the amount of capital expenditures devoted to its electric distribution system for the purpose of reliability and system resiliency, both in relation to routine operations and during major storm events. UI s application also proposes continuation of its revenue decoupling mechanism and proposes a new earnings sharing mechanism (ESM). Under the proposed ESM, 50% of UI s earnings in excess of the allowed ROE, plus a deadband above the allowed ROE, would be flowed through to the benefit of customers. The proposed ESM includes a 20-basis point deadband in 2017 above the authorized ROE, within which there would be no sharing. This deadband would be 30 basis points in 2018 and 40 basis points in 2019. UI proposes to continue applying any dollars due to customers to reduce the storm regulatory asset, if one exists. If none exists, then the customer share would be provided through a bill credit.

 The following table sets forth our operating revenues and expenses by segment for each of the periods indicated and as a percentage of the consolidated total of operating revenues and operating expenses, respectively: 

(1) Other amounts represent corporate and company eliminations.  
 Operating Revenues 
 Our operating revenues increased by 35% from $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as detailed by segment below: 
  Networks  
 Operating revenues increased by $389 million, or 51%, from $767 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,156 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The addition of UIL added $355 million to revenues, for an underlying increase of $34 million. Higher retail volumes increased revenues by $23 million due to increases in cooling demand.  Slightly lower retail rates decreased revenues by $2 million. Wholesale electricity revenues increased $5 million primarily due to higher volumes, which were higher in 2016 as a result of the warmer weather increasing cooling demand. Regulatory recoveries increased by approximately $8 million primarily due to increase relating to recoveries on the Ginna RSSA and New York rate case results offset primarily by revenue decoupling mechanisms, property tax deferrals and stranded costs. 
  Renewables  
 Operating revenues decreased by $27 million, or 9%, from $302 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $275 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Renewable production increased approximately 5%, or 139 GWh, with a corresponding increase to revenues of $7 million. Production increases were offset by lower average prices of approximately $3 million, $23 million in unfavorable mark-to-market, or MtM, changes on the market price of derivatives and other revenues were $7 million lower including lower intercompany revenues. 
  Gas  
 Operating revenues increased by $24 million from negative $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to lower demand payments for contracted storage, favorable MtM changes on derivatives and transport contracts.  
 Purchased Power, Natural Gas and Fuel Used 
 Our purchased power, natural gas and fuel used increased by 48%, from $211 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $312 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as detailed by segment below: 
 44 

Networks  
 Purchased power, natural gas and fuel used increased by $116 million, or 74%, from $155 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $271 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Excluding the $97 million from UIL, underlying expense increased compared with the same period of 2015 by $19 million. The increase was due to primarily to an increase in electric prices of approximately $9 million and electric volume of approximately $6 million.  
  Renewables  
 Purchased power, natural gas and fuel used decreased by $16 million, or 22%, from $72 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $56 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $17 million of favorable MtM changes on derivatives with a gain being recorded in the current period. 
  Gas  
 The gas business had no purchased power, natural gas and fuel used for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As a predominantly trading business, such expenses are required to be netted with revenues. 
 Operations and Maintenance 
 Our operations and maintenance increased by 31% from $421 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $553 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as detailed by segment below: 
  Networks  
 Operations and maintenance increased by $160 million or 52% from $310 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $470 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. UIL accounts for $137 million of this increase, with a $23 million increase attributable to the underlying business. This increase is primarily related to the Ginna RSSA, which has offsets in revenue. 
  Renewables  
 Operations and maintenance expenses increased by $18 million or 25% from $72 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $90 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Major maintenance expenses increased approximately $8 million and corporate charges increased $5 million compared to the prior period. 
  Gas  
 Operations and maintenance increased by $3 million, or 37%, from $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Increases in credit guarantee expenses and external services account for the increase in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment of Non-current Assets  
 Depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $203 million compared to $166 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $37 million. The primary drivers were UIL contributing $43 million of expense and Renewables decreasing by $10 million due to revision of useful lives of wind power station assets, which are partially offset by $6 million of increased expense at Networks relating to plant additions. 
 Other Income and (Expense) and Equity Earnings 
 Other income and (expense) and equity earnings decreased by $8 million from $13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. UIL contributed $6 million of income, Networks decreased $5 million resulting primarily from interest income on regulatory deferrals, Renewables increased $3 million as a result of the sale of other investment and Other decreased $7 million primarily relating to the receipt of income in 2015 from the previous sale of non-regulated entities. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Capitalization 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $60 million and $64 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of UIL, which added $21 million of expense, underlying expense was $25 million lower for the  
 45 

three months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. Networks was $19 million lower due to lower interest expense on regulatory deferrals.  
 Income Tax Expense 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 32.7%, which is lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the recognition of production tax credits associated with wind production. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was 50.9%, which is higher than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income tax expenses, partially offset by the recognition of production tax credits associated with wind production.  
   
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 The following table sets forth our operating revenues and expenses by segment for each of the periods indicated and as a percentage of the consolidated total of operating revenues and operating expenses, respectively: 

(1)   
 
 Other amounts represent corporate and company eliminations.    

 Operating Revenues 
 Our operating revenues increased by 41% from $3.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $4.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as detailed by segment below: 
  Networks  
 Operating revenues increased by $1.3 billion, or 51%, from $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The addition of UIL increased revenues by $1,186 million, for an underlying increase of $77 million. The milder winter weather in 2016 lowered demand for both electricity and gas, with a corresponding revenue impact of $85 million. Wholesale electricity revenues also declined $43 million due to a combination of lower volumes and wholesale market prices, which were down in 2016 as a result of the reduced demand due to milder weather. Other decreases of $26 million related to reductions in transmission congestion revenue of $18 million and lower retail rates of $8 million. Regulatory recoveries increased by $224 million primarily due to an adjustment of $126 million to unfunded future income tax to reflect the change from a flow through to normalization method, which has been recorded as an increase to revenue, with an offsetting and equal increase to income tax expense, an increase of $49 million relating to recoveries on the Ginna RSSA together with other increases for items such as revenue decoupling mechanisms, property tax deferrals and New York rate case impacts. 
  Renewables  
 Operating revenues increased by $4 million, or 1%, from $793 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $797 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in operating revenues was due to an increase of $34 million primarily from existing wind and other assets with output increasing 7%, or 758GWh and revenue of $12 million was realized from sales of transmission rights, offset by $24 million in unfavorable changes on MtM derivatives due to changes in market prices and $18 million in various other unfavorable changes including lower purchase price amortization and intercompany revenues. 
 46 

Gas  
 Operating revenues increased by $36 million from negative $28 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in operating revenues was due to $11 million of improved performance in the owned and contracted storage businesses, with both capturing higher spreads relative to the same period of previous year, $6 million favorable transportation contract, $6 million favorable MtM change and the remainder relating to various items including contract adjustments in the prior year. 
 Purchased Power, Natural Gas and Fuel Used 
 Our purchased power, natural gas and fuel used increased by 27%, from $754 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $961 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as detailed by segment below: 
  Networks  
 Purchased power, natural gas and fuel used increased by $224 million, or 34%, from $646 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $870 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Excluding the $366 million from UIL, underlying expense decreased by $142 million. Purchase volume requirements were 13% lower for electricity and 14% lower for gas for the same reasons outlined under Networks revenues, that is, the milder weather in winter 2016.  In addition, market prices were down 50% for electricity and 26% for gas.   
  Renewables  
 Purchased power, natural gas and fuel used decreased by $25 million, or 17%, from $143 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $118 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Klamath power plant expense was $2 million lower, MtM changes on derivatives were favorable $25 million due to market price changes in the current period and transmission and energy purchases were higher by $2 million. 
  Gas  
 The gas business had no purchased power, natural gas and fuel used for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As a predominantly trading business, such expenses are required to be netted with revenues. 
 Operations and Maintenance 
 Our operations and maintenance increased by 35% from $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as detailed by segment below: 
  Networks  
 Operations and maintenance increased by $451 million or 48% from $940 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. UIL accounts for $391 million of this increase, with the remaining $60 million attributable to the underlying business. The regulatory adjustment for the Ginna RSSA, which has offsets in revenue, accounts for an $86 million increase. Partially offsetting this are reductions of $23 million from lower expenditures on various state mandated energy efficiency programs, and $3 million of reductions spread over various areas, such as lower storm related expenditures, lower insurance claim expenses, and renewable energy credit purchases and adjustments to regulatory deferrals based on the rate plan in place effective from the second quarter for New York. 
  Renewables  
 Operations and maintenance expenses decreased by $6 million or 2% from $263 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $257 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Bad debt expense decreased $9 million due to specific expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 that did not occur in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Asset retirement related expenses were $2 million lower, as a result of the extension of the windfarm useful life in combination with revisions to expense estimates. These amounts were partially offset by higher maintenance costs on capital assets. 
 47 

Gas  
 Operations and maintenance increased by $9 million, or 36%, from $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $34 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Increases in credit guarantee expenses and external services account for the increase in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. 
 Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment of Non-current Assets  
 Depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $621 million compared to $535 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $86 million. The primary movements were UIL contributing $123 million, with the underlying business $37 million lower. Networks depreciation expense was $11 million lower, mainly as a result of updates to asset lives from the New York rate case. Renewables expense was $21 million lower as a result of no project impairment expenses in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the impairment expenses that occurred in the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, and $38 million lower depreciation expense due to revision of useful lives of wind farm assets offset by $15 million due to increases from the Baffin Bay wind asset only being operational for part of the prior period, combined with additional expense from salvage values and from asset retirement obligation estimations.  
 Other Income and (Expense) and Equity Earnings 
 Other income and (expense) and equity earnings increased by $41 million from $35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $76 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. UIL contributed $17 million of income. Of the remaining $24 million, $31 million was as a result of the sale of the Iroquois equity investment, and $3 million was as a result of the sale of other investment. An additional $6 million of income results from the reversal of the Maine Natural Gas provision in the current period that was initially recorded at the end of 2015. Offsetting these amounts were a $6 million decrease primarily from interest income on regulatory deferrals, due to updates from the New York rate case and $5 million for reduced allowance for funds used during construction in Networks. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Capitalization 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $212 million and $191 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of UIL, which added $62 million of expense, underlying expense was $41 million favorable.  Networks was $28 million favorable, mainly as a result of lower interest expense on regulatory deferrals, and Other was favorable by $12 million as a result of a reduction to the interest rate on outstanding debt and reduced outstanding debt. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 43.8%, which is higher than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate predominantly due to the impact of an adjustment of $126 million to unfunded future income tax to reflect the change from a flow through to normalization method following the approval of the Proposal by the NYPSC, which was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as an increase to income tax expense and an offsetting increase to revenue, the sale of the Iroquois equity investment in the same period partially offset by the recognition of production tax credits associated with wind. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 37.6%, which is higher than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income tax expenses, partially offset by the recognition of production tax credits associated with wind production.   
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we consider certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, or adjusted EPS. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are specific to AVANGRID and the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies may not be calculated in the same manner. We use these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, to establish operating budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. We believe that presenting such non-GAAP financial measures is useful because such measures can be used to analyze and compare profitability between companies and industries because it eliminates the impact of financing and certain non-cash charges. In addition, we present non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance.  
 48 

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to AVANGRID, adding back net income attributable to other noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, impairment of non-current assets and interest expense, net of capital  ization, and then subtracting other income and (expense) and earnings from equity method investments. We define adjusted net income as adjusted to reflect the full nine month period ended September 30, 2015 for UIL and to exclude gain on the sale of equity   method and other investment, impairment of investment, and costs related to the merger with UIL.     We believe adjusted net income is more useful in understanding and evaluating actual and projected financial performance and contribution of AVANGRID lines of   business and to more fully compare and explain our results. Additionally, we evaluate the nature of our revenues and expenses and adjust to reflect classification by nature for evaluation of our non-GAAP financial measures as opposed to by function. The m  ost directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income is net income. We also define adjusted gross margin as adjusted EBITDA adding back operations and maintenance and taxes other than income taxes and then subtracting transm  ission wheeling. We also define adjusted EPS as adjusted net income converted to an earnings per share amount.  We have also provided adjusted net income and EPS after mark-to-market adjustments to reflect the effect on adjusted net income of mark-to-marke  t changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used by AVANGRID to economically hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying physical transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity and gas.  
 The use of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, AVANGRID s U.S. GAAP financial information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness, may be unique to AVANGRID, should be considered only as a supplement to AVANGRID s U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools.  
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not primary measurements of our performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income, net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  
 Reconciliation of the Net Income attributable to AVANGRID to adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) before reflecting a full nine month period of 2015 UIL results, excluding gain on the sale of equity method and other investment, impairment of investment, costs related to the merger with UIL and before adjustments to reflect the classification of revenues and expenses by nature for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is as follows: 

(1)   
 
 Transmission wheeling is a component of operations and maintenance and is considered a component of adjusted gross margin since it is directly associated with the power supply costs included in the cost of sales.    

(2)    
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are presented before reflecting a full nine month period of 2015 UIL results, excluding gain on the sale of equity method and other investment, impairment of investment, costs related to the merger with UIL and before adjustments to reflect the classification of revenues and expenses by nature. For additional details of these adjustments and reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin that reflect these adjustments see the table on page 54 of this Form 10-Q.

 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are presented before reflecting a full nine month period of 2015 UIL results, excluding gain on the sale of equity method and other investment, impairment of investment, costs related to the merger with UIL and before adjustment to reflect the classification of revenues and expenses by nature. For additional details of these adjustments and reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin that reflect these adjustments see the table on page 54 of this Form 10-Q.    

 Our adjusted gross margin increased by $238 million, or 28%, from $795 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,033 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Our adjusted EBITDA increased by $93 million, or 28%, from $327 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $420 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Details of the period to period comparison are described below at the segment level. 
  Networks  
 Adjusted gross margin increased by $244 million from $568 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $812 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is associated primarily with the addition of UIL which added $228 million to the third quarter of 2016. Underlying margins increased by $16 million primarily due to increase in revenues, which is driven by increases in regulatory recoveries for items such as Ginna RSSA and the New York rate case. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $72 million or 32% from $224 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $296 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The impact of UIL added $81 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2016, with underlying business adjusted EBITDA decreasing by $9 million primarily due to increases in operations and maintenance expense driven by regulatory adjustments, such as the Ginna RSSA expense. 
  Renewables  
 Adjusted gross margin decreased by $10 million, or 4%, from $229 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $219 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable MtM changes on derivatives, lower intercompany revenues and lower prices. 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $34 million, or 22%, from $150 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $116 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for adjusted gross margin and higher maintenance costs on capital assets. 
  Gas  
 Adjusted gross margin increased by $22 million, from negative $16 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was due to lower demand payments for contracted storage, favorable MtM changes on derivatives and transport contracts. 
 50 

Adjusted EBITDA increased by $21 million, from negative $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to negative $5 million for the three months ended S  eptember 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for adjusted gross margin.  
   
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 The following table sets forth our adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) by segment for each of the periods indicated and as a percentage of operating revenues: 

(1)   
 
 Other amounts represent corporate and company eliminations.    

(2)   
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are presented before reflecting a full nine month period of 2015 UIL results, excluding gain on the sale of equity method and other investment, impairment of investment, costs related to the merger with UIL and before adjustments to reflect the classification of revenues and expenses by nature. For additional details of these adjustments and reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin that reflect these adjustments see the table on page 54 of this Form 10-Q.    

 Our adjusted gross margin increased by $1.0 billion, or 43%, from $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Our adjusted EBITDA increased by $544 million, or 57%, from $965 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Details of the period to period comparison are described below at the segment level. 
  Networks  
 Adjusted gross margin increased by $953 million from $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is associated primarily with the addition of UIL which added $746 million of gross margin. Underlying margins increased by $207 million. Although volume of both sales and purchased power were lower due to the mild winter in 2016, purchased power rates decreased comparatively more, due to declines in market prices in 2016, which, combined with increases in regulatory recoveries including the $126 million unfunded future income tax adjustment and impacts of the New York rate case, increased margins in 2016, partly offset by increases in the cost of transmission wheeling year over year. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $459 million or 66% from $693 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. UIL added $314 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2016, with underlying business adjusted EBITDA increasing by $145 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The increase was due to the same reasons discussed above for adjusted gross margin, partly offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses for transmission system reliability support. 
  Renewables  
 Adjusted gross margin increased by $28 million, or 4%, from $651 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $679 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was due to the increase in revenues from increases in wind production and sales of transmission rights. 
 51 

Adjusted EBITDA increased by $34 million, or 10%, from $349 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $383 million for the nine   months ended September 30, 2016. In addition to the same reasons discussed above for adjusted gross margin, operations and maintenance expenses were lower, related to reductions in bad debt and asset retirement obligation expenses.  
  Gas  
 Adjusted gross margin increased by $37 million, or 121%, from negative $30 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is associated with the increase in operating revenues due to favorable movement in spreads in the owned storage and gas transportation areas in the current period as compared to the same period of 2015. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $28 million, or 47%, from negative $58 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to negative $30 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was due primarily to the same reasons discussed above for adjusted gross margin offset by operations and maintenance expense increases in the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 resulting from higher credit support costs and external services. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation between Net Income attributable to AVANGRID and adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) and adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) by segment after reflecting a full nine month period of 2015 UIL results, excluding gain on the sale of equity method and other investment, impairment of investment, costs related to the merger with UIL, excluding the impact of mark-to-market activity and after adjustments to reflect the classification of revenues and expenses by nature for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our operations, capital investment and business development require significant short-term liquidity and long-term capital resources. Historically, we have used cash from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper programs  
 54 

as our primary sources of liquidity. Our long-term capital requirements have been met primarily through retention of earnings, equity contributions from Iberdrola and borrowings in the investment grade debt capital markets. Continued access to these source  s of liquidity and capital are critical to our ability to grow our business. Inability to access liquidity and capital resources could contribute to lower earnings and would result in reduced financial flexibility. Risks may increase due to circumstances b  eyond our control, such as a general disruption of the financial markets and adverse economic conditions.  
 We and our subsidiaries are required to comply with certain covenants in connection with our respective loan agreements. The covenants are standard and customary in financing agreements, and we and our subsidiaries were in compliance with such covenants as of September 30, 2016. 
 Liquidity Position 
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, available liquidity was approximately $1,682 million and $1,546 million, respectively. 
 We manage our overall liquidity position as part of the group of companies controlled by Iberdrola, or the Iberdrola Group, and are a party to a notional cash pooling agreement with Bank Mendes Gans, N.V., BMG, along with other Iberdrola, S.A. subsidiaries. The notional cash pooling agreement aids the Iberdrola Group in efficient cash management and reduces the need for external borrowing by the pool participants. Parties to the agreement, including us, may deposit funds with or borrow from BMG, provided that the net balance of funds deposited or borrowed by all pool participants in the aggregate is not less than zero. Deposits are available for next day withdrawal. Deposit in the cash pooling account was $353 million at December 31, 2015. In advance of the United Kingdom  BREXIT  vote, we took steps to reposition our liquidity and our deposits with BMG were withdrawn and reinvested in money market accounts. The BMG balance at September 30, 2016 was zero. The deposit amounts are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet under cash and cash equivalents because our deposited surplus funds are highly-liquid short-term investments. 
 The following table provides the components of our liquidity position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively: 

AVANGRID Commercial Paper Program 
 On May 13, 2016, AVANGRID entered into (i) a Commercial Paper/Certificates of Deposit Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, or Agency Agreement, with Bank of America, National Association, or BOA to facilitate AVANGRID s Commercial Paper Program, and (ii) Commercial Paper Dealer Agreements, or Dealer Agreements with each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Mizuho Securities, Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., each a Dealer, under which each of these Dealers may act as dealer of the commercial paper issued under AVANGRID s Commercial Paper Program. The AVANGRID commercial paper program is backstopped by the AVANGRID Credit Facility and has a limit of $1 billion. 
 The Agency Agreement provides that BOA shall act as agent for AVANGRID in connection with the issuance and payment of commercial paper notes, which are unsecured short-term promissory notes, or Notes, that may be issued or sold by AVANGRID in transactions exempt from registration under federal or state securities laws. The Notes will be book-entry obligations evidenced by a master note. In addition to providing for the issuance and payment of the Notes, the Agency Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and indemnification provisions. The Notes will be the direct financial obligation of AVANGRID upon their issuance pursuant to the Agency Agreement. As of November 3, 2016, AVANGRID had not issued any Notes.

AVANGRID Credit Facility  
 On April 5, 2016, AVANGRID and its subsidiaries, NYSEG, RGE, CMP, UI, CNG, SCG and BGC entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, or the AVANGRID Credit Facility, that provides for maximum borrowings of up to $1.5 billion in the aggregate. 
 Under the terms of the AVANGRID Credit Facility, each joint borrower has a maximum borrowing entitlement, or sublimit, which can be periodically adjusted to address specific short-term capital funding needs, subject to the maximum limit established by the banks. AVANGRID s maximum sublimit is $1 billion, NYSEG, RGE, CMP and UI have maximum sublimits of $250 million, CNG, and SCG have maximum sublimits of $150 million and BGC has a maximum sublimit of $25 million. Under the AVANGRID Credit Facility, each of the borrowers will pay an annual facility fee that is dependent on their credit rating.  The facility fees will range from 10.0 to 17.5 basis points. The maturity date for the AVANGRID Credit Facility is April 5, 2021. 
 As a condition of closing on the AVANGRID Credit Facility, the AVANGRID Revolving Credit Facility, the Joint Utility Revolving Credit Facility, and the UIL Credit Facility, each described below, were terminated and all amounts payable under the terminated facilities were repaid in full.  
 As of November 3, 2016, the AVANGRID Credit Facility is undrawn. 
 AVANGRID Revolving Credit Facility 
 The AVANGRID Revolving Credit Facility provided for maximum borrowings of up to $300 million and had a termination date in May 2019. As of December 31, 2015, this facility was undrawn. The facility was terminated on April 5, 2016, as a condition of closing on the AVANGRID Credit Facility. 
 Joint Utility Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Joint Utility Revolving Credit Facility provided for maximum borrowings at NYSEG, RG E and CMP of up to $600 million in the aggregate and had a termination date in July 2018. This facility served as a backstop for CMP and NYSEG s commercial paper programs. As of December 31, 2015, there was $586 million available under this facility. The facility was terminated on April 5, 2016, as a condition of closing on the AVANGRID Credit Facility. 
 UIL Credit Facility 
 The UIL Credit Facility provided for maximum borrowings at UIL, UI, CNG, SCG, and BGC of up to $400 million in the aggregate and had a termination date in November 2016. As of December 31, 2015, there was $233 million available under this facility. The facility was terminated on April 5, 2016, as a condition of closing on the AVANGRID Credit Facility. 
 Liquidity Management 
 We manage our overall liquidity position as part of the broader Iberdrola Group and are a party to a notional cash pooling agreement with BMG along with other Iberdrola, S.A. subsidiaries. We optimize our liquidity within the United States through a series of arms -length intercompany lending arrangements with our subsidiaries and among the regulated utilities to provide for lending of surplus cash to subsidiaries with liquidity needs, subject to the limitation that the regulated utilities may not lend to unregulated affiliates. These arrangements minimize overall short-term funding costs and maximize returns on the temporary cash investments of the subsidiaries. Effective with the execution of the AVANGRID Credit Facility on April 5, 2016, we have the capacity to borrow up to $1.5 billion from the lenders committed to the facility. This represents an increase of $200 million in borrowing capacity relative to the amounts previously available under the three separate facilities   the AVANGRID Revolving Credit Facility, the Joint Utility Revolving Credit Facility and the UIL Credit Facility. 
 Capital Requirements 
 We expect to fund any quarterly shareholder dividends primarily from the cash provided by operations of our businesses in the future. We have a revolving credit facility, as described above, to fund short-term liquidity needs and we believe that we will have access to the capital markets should additional, long-term growth capital be necessary. 
 We expect to incur approximately $0.9 billion in capital expenditures through the remainder of 2016. 
 56 

Cash Flows  
 Our cash flows depend on many factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory decisions, weather, commodity price movements, and operating expense and capital spending control. 
 The following is a summary of the cash flows by activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Renewables contributed $357 million of operating cash flow associated with wholesale sales of energy, Networks contributed $681 million of operating cash as the result of regulated transmission and distribution sales of electricity and natural gas, and Gas used $26 million in cash associated with losses on marketing of wholesale gas and gas storage services. Additionally, $28 million in cash was provided in support of the operating segments and changes in working capital provided $177 million in cash. The cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased by $253 million, primarily attributable to the increased operating revenues. The $332 million net change in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $72 million in accounts receivable and increase of $52 million in accounts payable due to impacts from sales and purchases, decrease in inventories and other assets of $59 million and $173 million, respectively, offset by decrease in other liabilities and regulatory assets/liabilities of $498 million and $201 million, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $963 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Renewables contributed $409 million of operating cash flow associated with wholesale sales of energy, Networks contributed $721 million of operating cash as the result of regulated transmission and distribution sales of electricity and natural gas, and Gas used $36 million in cash associated with losses on marketing of wholesale gas and gas storage services. Additionally $121 million in cash was used associated with corporate operating expenses in support of the operating segments. In addition, changes in working capital used $10 million in cash. The cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $191 million, primarily attributable to the decreased revenues at Renewables due to lower wind sources at existing assets and unfavorable pricing as well as decreased revenues at Gas due to lower gas prices. The $70 million net change in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in inventory of $40 million from lower gas requirements and a net decrease of $26 million in accounts payable and receivable due to impacts from sales and purchases. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $865 million, which was comprised of $749 million associated with capital expenditures at Networks and $284 million of capital expenditures at Renewables primarily associated with payments in support of the Desert Wind construction project. This was offset by $55 million of contributions in aid of construction, proceeds of $57 million from the sale of our equity method investment in Iroquois and other investment, $43 million from asset sale to the New York TransCo and $7 million from sale of property. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $613 million, which was comprised of $484 million associated with capital expenditures at Networks with the remainder primarily attributable to investments within Renewables, including turbine payments in support of the Baffin Bay wind construction project. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, financing activities used $596 million in cash reflecting primarily a net decrease in non-current and current notes payable of $242 million, payments on the tax equity financing arrangements of $75 million, repurchase of common stock of $4 million and dividends of $267 million. 
 57 

For nine months ended September 30, 2015, financing activities provided $218 million in cash. CMP issued $  150 million in first mortgage bonds and NYSEG issued $200 million of pollution control notes that were previously held in treasury. Additionally $60 million of pollution control notes matured at NYSEG. This was offset by a decrease in the amortization of t  he tax equity financing arrangements of $59 million.   
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 There have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to those reported for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in our Form 10-K. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes in contractual and contingent obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016  as compared to those reported for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in our Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The accompanying financial statements provided herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing the accompanying financial statements, our management has applied accounting policies and made certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholder s equity, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures thereof. While we believe that these policies and estimates used are appropriate, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates. The accounting policies and related risks described in our Form 10-K are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates. As of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to any of the policies described therein, except as discussed below for the revision of the estimated useful lives of wind power station assets at Renewables. 
 Renewables  wind power station assets in service less salvage value, if any, are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Renewables  effective depreciation rate, excluding decommissioning, was 4.0% in both 2015 and 2014. Renewables reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. In the first quarter of 2016, this review indicated that the actual lives of certain assets at wind power stations are expected to be longer than the previously estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, Renewables changed the estimates of the useful lives of certain assets from 25 years to 40 years, capped at the lease term if lower, to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets are expected to remain in service. The weighted average useful life of our wind farm assets is now approximately 30 years. We are continuing to assess lease extensions with leaseholders to potentially increase the average useful life of our wind farm assets to more than 30 years.   The effect of this change in estimate was to reduce depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $13 million and $38 million, reduce asset retirement obligation accretion expense recorded within operations and maintenance by approximately $1 and $2 million, increase earnings from equity method investments by approximately $2 million and $4 million, increase net income by $9 million and $27 million and increase basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.03 and $0.09 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. For the full year 2016, the effect of this change on income before income tax and net income is estimated to be an increase of approximately $59 million and approximately $37 million, respectively, and the impact on earnings per share is estimated to be an increase of approximately $0.12 per share on a basic and diluted basis. 
 New Accounting Standards 
 We review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will have. There have been no new accounting standards issued since the filing of our Form 10-K that we expect to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 58

Specifically, forward-looking statements may include statements relating to: 

the future financial performance, anticipated liquidity and capital expenditures of the Company;     

success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors;     

the risk that the businesses will not be coordinated successfully, or that the coordination will be more costly or more time consuming and complex than anticipated;

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. 
   
   Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
 There have been no material changes in our market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to those reported for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in our Form 10-K. 
   
   Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
