ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Yacht
Finders, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on November 15, 2000 as Sneeoosh Corporation. On October
20, 2000 the company filed an amended Certificate of Incorporation to change the name to Snohomish Corporation. The Company did
not conduct any operations until April 15, 2003, the date the Company filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to Yacht
Finders, Inc. Yacht Finder s Inc. business plan was to create an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to
interface immediately with each other while capturing the benefits of targeting a larger market. On November 6, 2007, the Company
discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan. The Company s business plan now consists of exploring potential
targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction.  

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. Operating results for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

USE
OF ESTIMATES  

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

LOSS
PER COMMON SHARE  

The
Company reports loss per share using a dual presentation of basic and diluted loss per share. Basic loss per share excludes the
impact of common stock equivalents and is determined by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. At September 30, 2016,
there were no variances between the basic and diluted loss per share as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding.  

GOING
CONCERN  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company generated
a net loss of $21,282 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and has a stockholders  deficit of $652,869 as
of September 30, 2016. These conditions, among others, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on working capital advances being provided
by the Company s majority shareholder for its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be
required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. There is no assurance that the working capital advances will continue in the future nor that
Company will be successful in raising additional funds through other sources.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CON T)   

NEW
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

From
time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting
or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had loans and notes outstanding from a shareholder in the aggregate amount of $510,412, which
bears interest at 6% per annum and represents amounts loaned to the Company to pay the Company s operating expenses. On
December 31, 2015, the Payee under the Note and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the Note to December 31, 2016.
The Company recorded interest on the Note for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 of $7,550. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had recorded an aggregate of $133,690 interest expense on the Note, none of which has been paid  

Pursuant
to a Services Agreement with Fountainhead Capital Management Limited ( FHM ), a shareholder who holds approximately
83.68% of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock, the Company is obligated to pay FHM a quarterly fee in the
amount of $10,000, in cash or in kind, on the first day of each calendar quarter commencing October 1, 2007. The Services Agreement
currently runs through December 31, 2016. Total fees paid to FHM for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $10,000.  

(4) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

The
Company has evaluated events occurring after the date of these financial statements through the date that these financial statements
were available to be issued. There were no material subsequent events as of that date which would require disclosure in or adjustments
to these financial statements.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION.   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto.    

Forward-Looking
Statements    

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management
as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. When used in this report, the words  believe, 
 anticipate,   expect,   estimate,   intend ,  plan  and similar expressions,
as they relate to us or our management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management s
current view of us concerning future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among many
others: a general economic downturn; a downturn in the securities markets; federal or state laws or regulations having an adverse
effect on proposed transactions that we desire to effect; Securities and Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading
in the securities of  penny stocks , and other risks and uncertainties. Should any of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this
report as anticipated, estimated or expected. The accompanying information contained in this registration statement, including,
without limitation, the information set forth under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation
-- Risk Factors  identifies important additional factors that could materially adversely affect actual results and performance.
You are urged to carefully consider these factors. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statement.  

Overview    

We
are a presently a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) whose plan of operation over the next twelve months
is to seek and, if possible, acquire an operating business or valuable assets by entering into a business combination. We will
not be restricted in our search for business combination candidates to any particular geographical area, industry or industry
segment, and may enter into a combination with a private business engaged in any line of business, including service, finance,
mining, manufacturing, real estate, oil and gas, distribution, transportation, medical, communications, high technology, biotechnology
or any other. Management s discretion is, as a practical matter, unlimited in the selection of a combination candidate.
Management will seek combination candidates in the United States and other countries, as available time and resources permit,
through existing associations and by word of mouth. This plan of operation has been adopted in order to attempt to create value
for our shareholders. For further information on our plan of operation and business, see PART I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended 2015.  

Plan
of Operation    

We
do not intend to do any product research or development. We do not expect to buy or sell any real estate, plant or equipment except
as such a purchase might occur by way of a business combination that is structured as an asset purchase, and no such asset purchase
currently is anticipated. Similarly, we do not expect to add additional employees or any full-time employees except as a result
of completing a business combination, and any such employees likely will be persons already then employed by the company acquired.  

The
Company s business plan consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets,
share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction. We anticipate no operations unless and until we complete a
business combination as described above.  

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2015    

The
following table summarizes the results of our operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current 3-month period to the prior
3-month period:  

We
recorded a net loss of $21,282 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a net loss of $21,319 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2015    

The
following table summarizes the results of our operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current 9-month period to the prior
9-month period:  

We
recorded a net loss of $67,652 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a net loss of $64,830 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

We
had $0 cash on hand at September 30, 2016 and had no other assets to meet ongoing expenses or debts that may accumulate. Since
inception, we have accumulated a deficit of $702,669. As of September 30, 2016 we had total liabilities and a negative working
capital of $652,869.  

We
have no commitment for any capital expenditure and foresee none. However, we will incur routine fees and expenses incident to
our reporting duties as a public company, and we will incur expenses in finding and investigating possible acquisitions and other
fees and expenses in the event we make an acquisition or attempt but are unable to complete an acquisition. Our cash requirements
for the next twelve months are principally for accounting expenses and other expenses related to making filings required under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which should not exceed $50,000 in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Any travel,
lodging or other expenses which may arise related to finding, investigating and attempting to complete a combination with one
or more potential acquisitions could also amount to thousands of dollars.  

We
will only be able to pay our future obligations and meet operating expenses by raising additional funds, acquiring a profitable
company or otherwise generating positive cash flow. As a practical matter, we are unlikely to generate positive cash flow by any
means other than acquiring a company with such cash flow. We believe that management members or shareholders will loan funds to
us as needed for operations prior to completion of an acquisition. Management and the shareholders are not obligated to provide
funds to us, however, and it is not certain they will always want or be financially able to do so. Our shareholders and management
members who advance money to us to cover operating expenses will expect to be reimbursed, either by us or by the company acquired,
prior to or at the time of completing a combination. We have no intention of borrowing money to reimburse or pay salaries to any
of our officers, directors or shareholders or their affiliates. There currently are no plans to sell additional securities to
raise capital, although sales of securities may be necessary to obtain needed funds. Our current management has agreed to continue
their services to us and to accrue sums owed them for services and expenses and expect payment reimbursement only.  

Should
existing management or shareholders refuse to advance needed funds, however, we would be forced to turn to outside parties to
either loan money to us or buy our securities. There is no assurance whatever that we will be able at need to raise necessary
funds from outside sources. Such a lack of funds could result in severe consequences to us, including among others:  

failure
    to make timely filings with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act, which also probably would result in suspension of trading
    or quotation in our stock and could result in fines and penalties to us under the Exchange Act;   

curtailing
    or eliminating our ability to locate and perform suitable investigations of potential acquisitions; or   

inability
    to complete a desirable acquisition due to lack of funds to pay legal and accounting fees and acquisition-related expenses.

We
hope to require potential candidate companies to deposit funds with us that we can use to defray professional fees and travel,
lodging and other due diligence expenses incurred by our management related to finding and investigating a candidate company and
negotiating and consummating a business combination. There is no assurance that any potential candidate will agree to make such
a deposit.  

G  oing
Concern    

Our
independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit issued in connection with the financial statements for
the period ended December 31, 2015, relative to our ability to continue as a going concern. We had $652,869 negative working capital
as of September 30, 2016; we had an accumulated deficit of $702,669 incurred through September 30, 2016 and recorded a loss of
$21,282 for the third quarter of 2016 and a loss of $84,863 from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.T he going
concern opinion issued by our auditors means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for 12-month
period ending December 31, 2016 and thereafter. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms and that our disclosure and controls are not designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.  

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results.H owever,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board
of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures,
which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal
controls over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION

There
are no legal proceedings which are pending or have been threatened against us or any of our officers, directors or control persons

    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which

f.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
