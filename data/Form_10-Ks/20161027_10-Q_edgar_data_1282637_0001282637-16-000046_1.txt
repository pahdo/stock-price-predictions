NEWMARKET CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

1.    Financial Statement Presentation 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of NewMarket Corporation and its subsidiaries contain all necessary adjustments for the fair statement of, in all material respects, our consolidated financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income for the   third quarter and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , and our changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  All adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the NewMarket Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (  2015   Annual Report), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The results of operations for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . The   December 31, 2015   condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
  Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to  we,   us,   our,  the  company,  and  NewMarket  are to NewMarket Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform to the current presentation. 

2.    Segment Information 
  The tables below show our consolidated segment results. The  All other  category includes the operations of the tetraethyl lead (TEL) business, as well as certain contracted manufacturing and services associated with Ethyl Corporation (Ethyl). 
    
  Consolidated Revenue by Segment

     Table of Contents  

Segment Operating Profit 

(a) 
    The gain (loss) on interest rate swap agreement represents the change, since the beginning of the reporting period, in the fair value of an interest rate swap which we entered into on June 25, 2009. We were not using hedge accounting to record the interest rate swap, and accordingly, any change in the fair value was immediately recognized in earnings. We terminated the interest rate swap on September 7, 2016, as discussed in Note 8. 

3.    Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits 
  The table below shows cash contributions made during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as well as the remaining cash contributions we expect to make during the year ending     December 31, 2016  , for our domestic and foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan. 

The tables below present information on net periodic benefit cost (income) for our domestic and foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan.  An amendment to the domestic postretirement plan was made in 2015 with an effective date of January 1, 2016, which provides post-65 medical and prescription drug benefits to retirees through a private healthcare exchange with fixed subsidies to eligible retirees through a health reimbursement account.  As a result, the domestic postretirement plan liabilities were remeasured at September 1, 2015 resulting in a non-cash improvement in the funded position.  The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss is reflected in prior service cost (credit) and is being amortized into expense.

     Table of Contents  

4.    Earnings Per Share 
  We had   25,789   shares of nonvested restricted stock and restricted stock units at   September 30, 2016   and   19,441   shares of nonvested restricted stock at   September 30, 2015   that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as their effect on earnings per share would be anti-dilutive.  
  The nonvested restricted stock is considered a participating security since the restricted stock contains nonforfeitable rights to dividends. As such, we use the two-class method to compute basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented since this method yielded a more dilutive result than the treasury-stock method. The following table illustrates the earnings allocation method utilized in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.

Table of Contents  

5.    Intangibles (Net of Amortization) and Goodwill 
    
  The net carrying amount of intangibles and goodwill was   $9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $11 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of each type of intangible asset and goodwill are presented in the table below.  

All of the intangibles relate to the petroleum additives segment. The change in the gross carrying amount between   2015   and   2016   is due to certain intangible assets related to formulas and technology becoming fully amortized during 2016, which resulted in a decrease of the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization, as well as foreign currency fluctuations. There is no accumulated goodwill impairment. 
  Amortization expense was (in thousands):   

Estimated amortization expense for the remainder of   2016  , as well as annual amortization expense related to our intangible assets for the next five years, is expected to be (in thousands): 

We amortize contracts over   10   years; customer bases over   20   years; formulas and technology over   10   years; and trademarks and trade names over   10   years. 

6.    Long-term Debt 

11 

     Table of Contents  

The outstanding senior notes have an aggregate principal amount of   $350 million   and are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act).  
  The capital lease obligation in the table above is related to the Singapore manufacturing facility. We record our capital lease obligations at the lower of fair market value of the related asset at the inception of the lease or the present value of the total minimum lease payments.  
  The following table provides information related to the unused portion of our revolving credit facility:       

The average interest rate for borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.9%   during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   1.9%   during the full year of   2015  . 
  We were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements at   September 30, 2016   and at   December 31, 2015  .  
  On July 15, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the revolving credit facility.  The amendment allows certain of our foreign subsidiaries to borrow under the original credit agreement dated as of October 28, 2014.  We did not incur significant additional financing fees with the amendment. 

7.    Commitments and Contingencies 
  Legal Matters 
  We are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to our business and include administrative or judicial actions seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund. Some of these legal proceedings relate to environmental matters and involve governmental authorities. For further information, see Environmental below. 
  While it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding, we believe the outcome of any of these proceedings, or all of them combined, would not result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
  In late 2013, Afton Chemical Corporation (Afton) initiated a voluntary self-audit of its compliance with certain sections of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) audit policy (Audit Policy). If any potential TSCA violations are discovered during the audit, we would voluntarily disclose them to the EPA under the Audit Policy. In August 2014, the EPA TSCA staff began its own TSCA inspection of both Afton and Ethyl. While it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome, we do not believe that any findings identified as a result of our audit or the EPA s TSCA inspection will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
  As we previously disclosed, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) advised us in early 2012 that it was conducting a review of certain of our foreign business activities in relation to compliance with relevant U.S. economic sanctions programs and anti-corruption laws, as well as certain historical conduct in the domestic U.S. market, and requested certain information in connection with such review. We have cooperated with the investigation. In connection with such cooperation, we voluntarily provided certain information and have conducted an internal review for that purpose. We have no indication at this time that the DOJ intends to take any action against the Company, and have made no provision with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements.   
  Environmental 
  We are involved in environmental proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous waste, and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities, or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP). While we believe we are currently adequately accrued for known environmental issues, it is possible that unexpected future costs could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our total accruals for environmental remediation, dismantling, and decontamination were approximately   $17 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

Our more significant environmental sites include a former TEL plant site in Louisiana (the Louisiana site) and a former Houston, Texas plant site (the Texas site). Together, the amounts accrued on a discounted basis related to these sites represented approximately   $10 million   of the total accrual at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , using discount rates ranging from   3%   to   9%  .  The aggregate undiscounted amount for these sites was   $13 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $14 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Of the total accrued for these two sites, the amount related to remediation of groundwater and soil for the Louisiana site was   $5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The amount related to remediation of groundwater and soil for the Texas site was   $5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  In 2000, the EPA named us as a PRP under Superfund law for the clean-up of soil and groundwater contamination at the five grouped disposal sites known as "Sauget Area 2 Sites" in Sauget, Illinois. Without admitting any fact, responsibility, fault, or liability in connection with this site, we are participating with other PRPs in site investigations and feasibility studies. In December 2013, the EPA issued its Record of Decision confirming its remedies for the selected Sauget Area 2 sites. We have accrued our estimated proportional share of the remedial costs and expenses addressed in the Record of Decision. We do not believe there is any additional information available as a basis for revision of the liability that we have established at   September 30, 2016  . The amount accrued for this site is not material.  

8.    Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. 
  We manage certain economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding, as well as through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. 
  Our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations of foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. To manage this exposure, we sometimes enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize currency exposure due to cash flows from foreign operations. There were no such contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Non-designated Hedges 
  On June 25, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap with Goldman Sachs in the notional amount of   $97 million   and with a maturity date of   January 19, 2022   (Goldman Sachs interest rate swap). We terminated this swap, which had been fully collateralized over the period that it was outstanding, on   September 7, 2016   and settled the liability using approximately   $22 million   of the cash deposit with Goldman Sachs. Under the terms of this interest rate swap, NewMarket made fixed rate payments at   5.3075%   and Goldman Sachs made variable rate payments based on three-month LIBOR. Until termination, we collateralized this exposure through cash deposits posted with Goldman Sachs which amounted to   $26 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  We have made an accounting policy election to not offset derivative fair value amounts with the fair value amounts for the right to reclaim cash collateral under our master netting arrangement. We did not use hedge accounting for the Goldman Sachs interest rate swap, and therefore, immediately recognized any change in the fair value of this derivative financial instrument directly in earnings. 
  The table below presents the fair value of our derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Credit-risk Related Contingent Features 
  The agreement we had with Goldman Sachs contained a provision under which we could have been declared in default on our derivative obligation if repayment of indebtedness was accelerated by our lender(s) due to our default on the indebtedness. 

9.    Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  The balances of, and changes in, the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consist of the following: 

(a) The pension plan and other postretirement benefit components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (income). See   Note 3   in this Form 10-Q and   Note 18   in our   2015   Annual Report for further information.

Table of Contents  

10.    Fair Value Measurements 
  The following table provides information on assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. No material events occurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   requiring adjustment to the recognized balances of assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As discussed in Note 8, we terminated the interest swap on   September 7, 2016  .  

Before the termination of the interest rate swap, its fair value was determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments. The analysis reflected the contractual term of the derivative, including the period to maturity.  The variable cash payments were based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves. In determining the fair value measurements, we incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the counterparties  nonperformance risk. 
  Although we had determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustment associated with the derivative utilized Level 3 inputs. These Level 3 inputs included estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by both us and the counterparties to the derivative. As of   December 31, 2015  , we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustment on the overall valuation of our derivative and determined that the credit valuation adjustment was not significant to the overall valuation of the derivative. Accordingly, we determined that our derivative valuation should be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  We have made an accounting policy election to measure credit risk of any derivative financial instruments subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. 
  Long-term debt     We record the carrying amount of our long-term debt at historical cost, less deferred financing costs related to the senior notes. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is shown in the table below and is based primarily on estimated current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining duration and adjusted for nonperformance risk and credit risk. The estimated fair value of our publicly-traded senior notes included in long-term debt in the table below is based on the last quoted price closest to   September 30, 2016  . The fair value is categorized as Level 2.

11.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  On January 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  (ASU 2015-03), which requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in a   $3.6 million   reduction of both  Deferred charges and other assets  and  Long-term debt  on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015  . Also on January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  (ASU 2015-15), which allows a company to defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, including arrangements with no outstanding borrowings, classify them as an asset, and amortize them over the term of the arrangements. We adopted ASU 2015-15 concurrent with the adoption of ASU 2015-03, as required. 
  Also on January 1, 2016, we early adopted ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  (ASU 2015-17), which requires the reporting of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets as noncurrent items on the classified balance sheet. We retrospectively adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17 resulting in   $6.4 million   of current deferred income taxes being reclassified to non-current on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015  . 
  On April 1, 2016, we early adopted ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" (ASU 2016-09). The update involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. As required by the ASU, we adopted all of the amendments in the same period. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 replaces the previous guidance and clarifies the principles for revenue recognition. It requires a five-step process for revenue recognition that represents the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received by a company. ASU 2014-09 also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for our reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. Entities are permitted to adopt this standard one year early. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We expect to adopt the standard on January 1, 2018 and continue to evaluate whether we will adopt the standard retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment.  We are continuing to assess the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09, as well as those subsequently issued updates that clarify the provisions of ASU 2014-09, will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" (ASU 2016-02). The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosures related to certain information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, operating leases are, in most cases, required to be recognized on the balance sheet as a lease asset and liability. A modified retrospective approach is required for the adoption of ASU 2016-02, which is effective for our reporting period beginning January 1, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Overview 
  When comparing the first   nine months   of   2016   with the first   nine months   of 2015, revenue was lower primarily due to lower selling prices, with product shipments, including the impact of product mix, also being lower than the same period of 2015.  Petroleum additives operating profit was higher for the first   nine months   of 2016 compared to the first   nine months   of 2015 due to lower raw material costs, substantially offset by lower product shipments and selling prices.   
  Our operations generate cash that is in excess of the needs of the business, including increased working capital requirements.  We continue to invest and manage the business for the long-term with the goal of helping our customers succeed in their marketplaces.  Our investments continue to be in organizational talent, technology development and processes, and global infrastructure, consisting of technical centers and production capacity, in support of our business.  

Results of Operations 
  Revenue 
  Consolidated revenue for the   third quarter   of 2016 totaled $516.1 million, representing a decrease of 4.6% from the   third quarter   of 2015 of $540.9 million.  Consolidated revenue for the first   nine months   of 2016 was almost $1.6 billion which was a decrease of 6.8% from the first   nine months   of 2015 of $1.7 billion. The following table shows revenue by segment and product line.

Petroleum Additives Segment 
  The regions in which we operate include North America (the United States and Canada), Latin America (Mexico, Central America, and South America), Asia Pacific, and the Europe/Middle East/Africa/India (EMEAI) region. While there is some fluctuation, the percentage of revenue generated in the regions remained fairly consistent when comparing the first   nine months   of 2016 with the same period in 2015, as well as with the full year in 2015. In addition, the percentage of lubricant additives sales and fuel additives sales is also substantially consistent between periods.     
  Petroleum additives net sales for the   third quarter   of 2016 was $512.4 million compared to $536.2 million for the   third quarter   of 2015, a decrease of 4.4%.  The decrease between the two   third quarter   periods was across all regions except the Asia Pacific region, which reflected an increase.  Similarly, petroleum additives net sales for the first   nine months   of 2016 of $1.5 billion decreased $113.7 million, or 6.9%, from the $1.6 billion reported for the first   nine months   of 2015. The decrease for the nine months comparison was across all regions except the Asia Pacific region, which also reflected an increase.  
  The following table details the approximate components of the decrease in net sales between the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016   and   2015  . 

When comparing the two third quarter periods, lower selling prices were the predominant factor resulting in the decrease in petroleum additives net sales with the mix of product shipments also a contributing factor.  Foreign currency had a small favorable impact on petroleum additives between the two third quarter periods of 2016 and 2015.  The volume of product shipments of lubricant additives decreased slightly between the two third quarter periods, but was substantially offset by an increase in the volume of fuel additives product shipments, resulting in overall product shipments on a worldwide basis being unchanged when comparing the two third quarter periods.  An increase in lubricant additive product shipments in the Asia Pacific region mostly offset decreases in the North America, Latin America and EMEAI regions.  The increase in fuel additive product shipments primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent the Asia Pacific region, was partially offset by small decreases in the EMEAI and Latin America regions.                 
  Lower selling prices were the primary factor of the decrease in petroleum additives net sales when comparing the two nine month periods, with lower product shipments also a significant factor.  Consistent with last year but not to the same level of significance, foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales.  The U.S. Dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies in which we transact, resulting in an unfavorable impact on net sales when comparing the first nine months of 2016 with the same period in 2015. The Japanese Yen strengthened against the U.S. Dollar during the same time period partially offsetting the unfavorable impact from the other currencies in which we transact.  The volume of product shipments for petroleum additives decreased approximately 1.6% on a worldwide basis when comparing the first nine months of 2016 with the same period in 2015.  Decreases in the volume of shipments of lubricant additives were partially offset by an increase in the volume of shipments of fuel additives products.  Despite the small increase in fuel additives shipments, the mix of fuel additives products sold resulted in a negative dollar impact on sales.  The reduction in the lubricant additives product shipments for the nine month comparison resulted from decreases in the North America

and Latin America regions, which was partially offset by an increase in the Asia Pacific region.  Lubricant additives product shipments in the EMEAI region were substantially unchanged between the nine month periods.  The increase in the volume of product shipments in fuel additives for the nine month comparative periods was in the North America and Asia Pacific regions, which was partially offset by a decrease in the EMEAI region.  Fuel additives product shipments in the Latin America region were substantially unchanged when comparing the nine months periods.          
    
  All Other 
  The  All other  category includes the operations of the TEL business and certain contracted manufacturing and services associated with Ethyl.   
    
  Segment Operating Profit 
  NewMarket evaluates the performance of the petroleum additives business based on segment operating profit. NewMarket Services Corporation expenses are charged to NewMarket and each subsidiary pursuant to services agreements between the companies. Depreciation on segment property, plant, and equipment, as well as amortization of segment intangible assets, is included in segment operating profit.   
  The following table reports segment operating profit for the   third quarter and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  

Petroleum Additives Segment 
  The petroleum additives segment operating profit increased $5.9 million when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2015 and $9.7 million when comparing the first   nine months   of   2016   to the same period in   2015  .  Both comparative periods included the impact of the same factors that affected gross profit (see discussion below) including a favorable currency impact.  The operating profit margin was 20.8% for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 18.7% for the third quarter of 2015 and was 20.2% for the first   nine months   of   2016   as compared to 18.2% for the first   nine months   of   2015  . For the rolling four quarters ended   September 30, 2016  , the operating profit margin for petroleum additives was 19.1%, which is in line with our expectations for the performance of our business over the long-term. While operating profit margins will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to multiple factors, we do not operate our business differently from quarter to quarter. We believe the fundamentals of our business and industry are unchanged. Our continued focus is on developing and delivering innovative, technology-driven solutions to our customers. 
  Gross profit results increased $3.5 million when comparing the two third quarter periods and $8.2 million when comparing the first     nine months     of     2016     and     2015  . Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 65.6% for the third quarter of 2016, down from 67.8% for the third quarter of 2015 and 65.6% for the first     nine months     of     2016  , down from 68.5% for the   first   nine months   of   2015  . 
  When comparing both the third quarter and nine month periods of 2016 and 2015, the primary factor in the improvement in gross profit resulted from a favorable raw material cost variance due to lower costs, which contributed over 100% of the change.  Conversion costs were also favorable for the third quarter and nine month comparisons, but an unfavorable selling price variance, as well as an unfavorable volume variance (as discussed in the Revenue section above), mostly offset the favorable impacts.  The sales price variance for the comparative   periods included the impact from foreign currency rates as discussed in the Revenue section above.    
  Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG A) was essentially flat when comparing both the third quarter and nine month periods of 2016 and 2015.  SG A as a percentage of revenue was 6.5% for the third quarter of 2016, 6.2% for the third quarter of 2015, 6.6% for the first   nine months   of   2016  , and 6.1% for the first   nine months   of   2015  . Our SG A costs are primarily personnel-related and include salaries, benefits, and other costs associated with our workforce. There were no significant changes in the drivers of these costs when comparing the periods.

     Table of Contents  

Our investment in research, development, and testing (R D) for the third quarter of 2016 decreased approximately $2.1 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Similarly, the first   nine months   of   2016   decreased $2.0 million from the first   nine months   of   2015  .  For the third quarter comparison, both the lubricant additives and fuel additives product lines reflected a decrease, while for the nine month comparison, investments in research and development in the lubricant additives product line increased, but were more than offset by reductions in the fuel additives product line.  As a percentage of revenue, R D was 7.2% for the third quarter of 2016, 7.3% for the third quarter of 2015, 7.6% for the first   nine months   of   2016   and 7.2% for the first   nine months   of   2015  . Our R D investments reflect our efforts to support the development of solutions that meet our customers' needs, as well as new standards, and to expand into new product areas. Our approach to R D investment, as it is with SG A, is one of purposeful spending on programs to support our current product base and to ensure that we develop products to support our customers' programs in the future. R D investments include personnel-related costs, as well as internal and external testing of our products.  
    
  The following discussion references the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Interest and Financing Expenses 
  Interest and financing expenses were   $4.3 million   for the third quarter of 2016,   $3.5 million   for the third quarter of 2015,   $12.5 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016  , and   $10.9 million   for the first   nine months   of   2015  . The increase in interest and financing expenses between both the third quarter and nine month periods of   2016   and   2015   resulted primarily from higher average debt, which was partially offset by a lower average interest rate.  

Other Income (Expense), Net 
  Other income (expense), net   was income of   $0.7 million   for the third quarter of 2016, expense of   $3.4 million   for the third quarter of 2015, expense of   $2.8 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016   and expense of   $4.0 million   for the first   nine months   of   2015  . The amounts for all periods included the impact from a derivative instrument representing an interest rate swap recorded at fair value through earnings. See   Note 8   for additional information on the interest rate swap.  

Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense was   $26.8 million   for the third quarter of   2016   and   $28.7 million   for the third quarter of 2015.  The effective tax rate was 27.3% for the third quarter of 2016 and 31.6% for the third quarter of 2015.  The decrease in the effective income tax rate resulted in lower income tax expense of $4.3 million, offset by an increase in income before income tax expense that resulted in higher income tax expense of $2.4 million.    
  Income tax expense was   $81.5 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016   and   $86.7 million   for the first   nine months   of   2015  . The effective tax rate was   29.2%   for the   nine months   of   2016   and   31.9%   for the   nine months   of   2015  . The decrease in the effective income tax rate resulted in lower income tax expense of $7.7 million, with the remainder of the change in income tax expense due to higher income before income tax expense.   
  The effective tax rates for all periods included the benefit of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States tax rate, as well as a benefit from the U.S. domestic manufacturing tax deduction.  During the 2016 periods, a higher percentage of our income before income taxes resulted from operations in foreign locations than during the 2015 periods.  The effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 also included the benefit of the U.S. R D tax credit, which is not included in the 2015 effective tax rate for either the third quarter or nine month period in 2015, as the legislation was signed into law in December 2015.

Cash Flows, Financial Condition, and Liquidity 
  Cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   were   $187.9 million  , which was   an increase   of   $94.5 million   since   December 31, 2015  .  
  Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately   $180.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $91.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . A significant amount, but not all, of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested. We plan to use these indefinitely reinvested earnings to support growth outside of the United States through funding of operating expenses, R D expenses, capital expenditures, and other cash needs of our foreign subsidiaries. Periodically, we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the United States through intercompany dividends. These intercompany dividends are paid only by subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted are indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as previously taxed income, as defined by the United States Internal Revenue Code. If circumstances were to change that would cause these indefinitely reinvested earnings to be repatriated, an incremental U.S. tax liability would be incurred. As part of our foreign subsidiary repatriation activities, we received cash dividends of $0.3 million for the   nine months   ended September 30, 2016 and $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  We expect that cash from operations, together with borrowing available under our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to cover our operating needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
  Cash Flows   Operating Activities 
  Cash flows   provided from   operating activities for the first   nine months   of   2016   were   $259.5 million  , including   an increase   of   $0.9 million   due to slightly lower working capital requirements, which excluded a significant unfavorable foreign currency impact to the components of working capital on the balance sheet. 
  Other than the increase in cash and cash equivalents, the most significant changes in working capital resulted from an increase in accounts receivable along with a decrease in accrued expenses, which were offset by a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable. The higher accounts receivable balance was primarily due to higher sales levels in certain locations when comparing the third quarter of 2016 with the fourth quarter of 2015.  The decrease in inventory was primarily the result of a planned reduction in quantity on hand, as well as impact from lower material cost.  The increase in accounts payable was due to timing of payments, while the decrease in accrued expenses resulted from normal payments for customer-related costs. 
  Including cash and cash equivalents, as well as the impact of foreign currency on the balance sheet, we had total working capital of   $581.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $504.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The current ratio was   3.17   to 1 at   September 30, 2016   and   2.91   to 1 at   December 31, 2015  .   
  Cash Flows   Investing Activities 
  Cash   used in   investing activities was   $102.2 million   during the first   nine months   of   2016   and included   $101.7 million   for capital expenditures. We continue to expect that our total capital spending during   2016   will exceed the $126 million incurred in 2015, including anticipated spending on the new manufacturing facility in Singapore, and several improvements to our manufacturing and R D infrastructure around the world. We expect to continue to finance capital spending through cash on hand and cash provided from operations, together with borrowing available under our   $650 million   revolving credit facility.  During the third quarter of 2016, we terminated the Goldman Sachs interest rate swap, which had been fully collateralized over the period that it was outstanding, and settled the liability using approximately $21.9 million from the cash deposit with Goldman Sachs.  
  Cash Flows   Financing Activities 
  Cash   used in   financing activities during the first   nine months   of   2016   amounted to   $60.8 million  . The cash was mainly used to repurchase   $35.8 million   of our common stock and to pay dividends of   $56.9 million  .  Our long-term debt of   $531.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , increased approximately   $40.5 million   since   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the additional borrowing on our revolving credit facility.  Long-term debt was also impacted by the addition of a capital lease related to the Singapore manufacturing facility.  
  Debt 
  At   September 30, 2016  , in addition to the revolving credit facility which is discussed below, we had outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of   $350 million   that bear interest at a fixed rate of   4.10%   and are due in   2022  . These senior notes are registered under the Securities Act.

     Table of Contents  

Revolving Credit Facility     At   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $650 million   multicurrency revolving credit facility, with a   $100 million   sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a   $75 million   sublimit for letters of credit, and a   $20 million   sublimit for swingline loans. The agreement includes an expansion feature, which allows us, subject to certain conditions, to request an increase to the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility or obtain incremental term loans in an amount up to   $150 million  . Borrowings bear interest at variable rates. The revolving credit facility matures on   October 28, 2019  .  On July 15, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the revolving credit facility.  The amendment allows certain of our foreign subsidiaries to borrow under the original credit agreement dated as of October 28, 2014.  We did not incur significant additional financing fees with the amendment. 
  The following table provides information related to the unused portion of our revolving credit facility: 

Both the 4.10% senior notes and the revolving credit facility contain covenants, representations, and events of default that management considers typical of credit arrangements of this nature. The more restrictive and significant financial covenants under the revolving credit facility include: 
     A consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 3.50 to 1.00; and 
     A consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, calculated on a rolling four quarter basis. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Leverage Ratio was   1.33   and the Interest Coverage Ratio was   22.44  , while at   December 31, 2015   the Leverage Ratio was   1.28   and the Interest Coverage Ratio was   24.12  . We were in compliance with all covenants under both the revolving credit facility and the 4.10% senior notes at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  As a percentage of total capitalization (total long-term debt and shareholders  equity), our total long-term debt percentage   decreased   from   55.9%   at   December 31, 2015   to   52.7%   at   September 30, 2016  . The change in the percentage was primarily the result of the increase in shareholders' equity partially offset by the increase in long-term debt. The change in shareholders  equity reflects our earnings offset by the impact of dividend payments, stock repurchases, and changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment. Normally, we repay any outstanding long-term debt with cash from operations or refinancing activities.

Outlook 
  We are pleased with the overall performance of our business through the first nine months of 2016. Our stated goal is to provide a 10% return per year for our shareholders over any five year period (defined by earnings per share growth plus dividends), although we may not necessarily achieve a 10% return each year. We continue to have confidence in our customer-focused strategy and approach to the market. We believe the fundamentals of how we run our business - a long-term view, safety-first culture, customer-focused solutions, technology-driven product offerings, and world-class supply chain capability - will continue to be beneficial for all of our stakeholders.  
  We expect our petroleum additives segment to deliver solid performance in 2016, after having posted strong operating results over the past several years. We expect that the petroleum additives industry shipment demand will grow at an average annual rate of 1% to 2% over the long-term, as there have been no significant changes in the positive fundamentals of the industry. Over the long-term, we plan to exceed the industry growth rate. We have made significant investments to expand our capabilities around the world over the last few years, which have continued in 2016. These investments have been and will continue to be in organizational talent, technology development and processes, and global infrastructure, consisting of technical centers, production capability and geographic expansion. Representing evidence of our commitment to global investment in support of our customers, we have completed construction of phase one of our new manufacturing facility in Singapore.  Phase two is underway in Singapore and will more than double our investment there. We intend to utilize these new capabilities to improve our ability to deliver the solutions that our customers value and to expand our global reach and improve profits. We will continue to invest in our capabilities to provide even better service, technology, and customer solutions.  
  Our business generates significant amounts of cash beyond what is necessary for the expansion and growth of our current offerings. We are making investments to position ourselves for the future. We regularly review our many internal opportunities to utilize this cash from a technological, geographic, and product line perspective. We believe our capital spending is creating the capability we need to grow and support our customers worldwide, and our research and development investments are positioning us well to provide added value to our customers. Our primary focus in the acquisition area remains on the petroleum additives industry. It is our view that this industry segment will provide the greatest opportunity for solid returns on our investments while minimizing risk. We remain focused on this strategy and will evaluate any future opportunities. Nonetheless, we are patient in this pursuit and intend to make the right acquisition when the opportunity arises. We will continue to evaluate all alternative uses of cash to enhance shareholder value, including stock repurchases and dividends.

ITEM 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes in our market risk from the information provided in the   2015   Annual Report except for the termination of the Goldman Sachs interest rate swap.  See Note 8 for additional information. 

ITEM 4.     Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance of the reliability of the financial records and the protection of assets. Our controls and procedures include written policies and procedures, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and an internal audit program. We use third-party firms, separate from our independent registered public accounting firm, to assist with internal audit services. 
  We work closely with the business groups, operations personnel, and information technology to ensure transactions are recorded properly. Environmental and legal staff are consulted to determine the appropriateness of our environmental and legal liabilities for each reporting period. We regularly review the regulations and rule changes that affect our financial disclosures. 
  Our disclosure controls and procedures include signed representation letters from our regional officers, as well as senior management. 
  We have a Financial Disclosure Committee (the committee), which is made up of the president of Afton, the general counsel of NewMarket, and the controller of NewMarket. The committee makes representations with regard to the financial statements that, to the best of their knowledge, the statements do not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit a material fact that is necessary to make the statements not misleading with respect to the periods covered by the report. They also represent that, to the best of their knowledge, the financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in the report. 
  Management personnel from our geographic regions also represent that, to the best of their knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information from their respective regions, which are included in our consolidated financial statements, fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of their respective regions as of and for the periods presented in the report. 
  Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1.     Legal Proceedings 
  We are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to our business and include administrative or judicial actions seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund. Some of these legal proceedings relate to environmental matters and involve governmental authorities. For further information, see  Environmental  in   Note 7  . 
  While it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding, we believe the outcome of any of these proceedings, or all of them combined, would not result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
  In late 2013, Afton initiated a voluntary self-audit of its compliance with certain sections of TSCA under the EPA s Audit Policy. If any potential TSCA violations are discovered during the audit, we would voluntarily disclose them to the EPA under the Audit Policy. In August 2014, the EPA TSCA staff began its own TSCA inspection of both Afton and Ethyl. While it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome, we do not believe that any findings identified as a result of our audit or the EPA s TSCA inspection will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
  As we previously disclosed, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) advised us in early 2012 that it was conducting a review of certain of our foreign business activities in relation to compliance with relevant U.S. economic sanctions programs and anti-corruption laws, as well as certain historical conduct in the domestic U.S. market, and requested certain information in connection with such review. We have cooperated with the investigation. In connection with such cooperation, we voluntarily provided certain information and have conducted an internal review for that purpose.  We have no indication at this time that the DOJ intends to take any action against the Company, and have made no provision with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements.
