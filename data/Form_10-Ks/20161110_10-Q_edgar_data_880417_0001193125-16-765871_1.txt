 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited)     NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES     The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CSB Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, The Commercial and Savings Bank (the  Bank ) and CSB Investment Services, LLC (together referred to as the  Company  or  CSB ). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.    The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which
include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position at September 30, 2016, and the results of operations and changes in cash flows for the periods presented have been made.  
 Certain information and footnote disclosures typically included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ( U.S. GAAP ) have been omitted. The Annual Report for CSB for the year ended December 31, 2015, contains Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnote disclosures, which should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year or any future interim period.  
 Certain items in the prior-year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.  
  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     In May 2014,
the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Update s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this Update specifies the accounting for certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements
for revenue recognition. The Update was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Subsequently, the FASB issued a one-year deferral for
implementation, which results in new guidance being effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the
Company s financial position or results of operations.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall
(Subtopic 825-10):     Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . This Update sets forth targeted improvements to GAAP including, but not limited to, requiring an entity to recognize the changes in fair
value of equity investments in the income statement, requiring public business entities to use the exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for financial statement disclosure purposes, eliminating certain disclosures
required by existing GAAP, and providing for additional disclosures. The Update is effective for the fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This Update sets forth a new lease accounting model for lessors and lessees. For lessees, all leases will be required to be recognized on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset. Subsequent accounting
for leases varies depending on whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the existing guidance. The ASU requires additional qualitative and
quantitative disclosures with the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The Update is effective for the fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2018,
with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED)   
   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) . The amendments apply
to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options. The amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for assessing
whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt host. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this Update is required to assess
the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. For entities other than public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial
position or results of operations.    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. This Update is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial
instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The underlying premise of the Update is that financial assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for
credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses should reflect management s current estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of a financial asset. The income
statement will be effected for the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. ASU 2016-13 is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments should be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. Among these include recognizing cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment as cash outflows
for financing activities; cash proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the related insurance coverage; and cash proceeds received from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies should
be classified as cash inflows from investing activities while the cash payments for premiums on bank-owned policies may be classified as cash outflows for investing activities, operating activities, or a combination of investing and operating
activities. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim
period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the
amendments in the same period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments
for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s statement of cash flows.

   NOTE 2   SECURITIES  (CONTINUED)    
   
  The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are
shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  
   
   Securities with a fair value of approximately $92.4 million and $94.3 million were pledged at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, to secure public deposits, as well as other deposits and borrowings as required or permitted by law.    Restricted
stock primarily consists of investments in Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank stock. The Bank s investment in FHLB stock amounted to approximately $4.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Federal Reserve Bank stock was $471 thousand at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    The following table shows the proceeds from sales of
available-for-sale securities and the gross realized gains and losses on the sales of those securities that have been included in earnings as a result of the sales.      
   Income tax provisions from realized gains were less than $1 thousand for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016. The income tax provision applicable to realized gains amounted to $0 and $19 thousand for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2015, respectively.

   NOTE 2   SECURITIES  (CONTINUED)    
   
  The following table presents gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities, aggregated by investment
category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   There were twelve (12) securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016, five (5) of which were in a continuous
loss position for twelve months or more. At least quarterly, the Company conducts a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment. The assessments are based on the nature of the securities, the extent and duration of the securities in an
unrealized loss position, the extent and duration of the loss and management s intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that management will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be
maturity. Management believes the Company will fully recover the cost of these securities. It does not intend to sell these securities and likely will not be required to sell them before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost
basis, which may be maturity. As a result, management concluded that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.

   NOTE 3   LOANS   
 Loans consist of the following:      
    Loan Origination/Risk Management   
 The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management
reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan
delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions.  
 Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business.
Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. The Company s management examines current and occasionally projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their
obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers; however, may not be as expected and the
collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some
short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due
from its customers.    Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of
real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is largely
dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general
economy. The properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the Company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry. Management
monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. At
September 30, 2016 approximately 79% of the outstanding principal balances of the Company s commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties as compared to 76% at December 31, 2015.  
 With respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner occupied properties, the Company generally requires the borrower to have had an
existing relationship with the Company and have a proven record of success. Construction and land development loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis
of the developers and property owners. Construction and land development loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate.

   NOTE 3   LOANS  (CONTINUED)    
   
  Construction and land development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment
substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the
Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes,
governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing.    The Company originates consumer loans
utilizing a judgmental underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that
are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk.    The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the
credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the
Company s policies and procedures.   Loans serviced for others approximated $82.5 million and $76.3 million at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.     Concentrations of Credit   
 Nearly all of the Company s lending activity occurs within the state of Ohio, including the four (4) counties of Holmes, Stark, Tuscarawas and Wayne, as
well as other markets. The majority of the Company s loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no concentrations of loans related
to any single industry.     Allowance for Loan Losses   
 The following tables detail activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.    The
changes in the provision for loan losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to commercial loans were primarily due to charge-offs of loans in this category as well as an increase in the specific reserve for one
commercial relationship. The decrease in the provision related to commercial real estate loans for the nine month period in 2016 was primarily due to a recovery of a prior charge-off. The increase in the provision for consumer loans during the three
and nine month periods of 2016 relates to charge-offs of loans in this category as well as the increase in loan volume.   The changes in the provision for
loan losses for the three and nine month periods of 2015 related to commercial and industrial loans were primarily due to the increase in a specific reserve for one commercial relationship as well as the increase in the qualitative economic factors
applied to loans in this category. The decrease in the provision related to commercial real estate loans was primarily due to the overall improved credit quality of the loans in this category.

   Troubled Debt Restructurings   
 All troubled debt restructurings ( TDR s) are individually evaluated for impairment and a related allowance is recorded, as needed. Loans whose terms
have been modified as TDR s totaled $7.1 million as of September 30, 2016, and $7.6 million as of December 31, 2015, with $13 thousand and $26 thousand of specific reserves allocated to those loans, respectively. At September 30, 2016,
$6.3 million of the loans classified as TDR s were performing in accordance with their modified terms. Of the remaining $786 thousand, all were in nonaccrual of interest status.  
 The Company held $33 thousand in foreclosed real estate as of September 30, 2016, and no foreclosed real estate as of December 31, 2015. Consumer
mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure were $403 thousand at September 30, 2016 and $89 thousand at December 31, 2015.    The following table presents
loans restructured during the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2015.

   Credit Quality Indicators   
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current
financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes commercial loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This
analysis includes commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $300 thousand. This analysis is performed on an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  
  Pass . Loans classified as pass (Acceptable, Low Acceptable or Pass Watch) may exhibit a wide array of characteristics but at a minimum
represent an acceptable risk to the Bank. Borrowers in this rating may have leveraged but acceptable balance sheet positions, satisfactory asset quality, stable to favorable sales and earnings trends, acceptable liquidity and adequate cash
flow. Loans are considered fully collectible and require an average amount of administration. While generally adhering to credit policy, these loans may exhibit occasional exceptions that do not result in undue risk to the Bank. Borrowers are
generally capable of absorbing setbacks, financial and otherwise, without the threat of failure.     Special Mention . Loans classified
as special mention have material weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan at some future date.  
  Substandard . Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor
or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the
deficiencies are not corrected.     Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as
substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.  
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed
as not rated are either less than $300 thousand or are included in groups of homogeneous loans. Based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class is as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

  The following table presents loans that are not rated by class of loans as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. Nonperforming loans include loans past due 90 days or more and loans on nonaccrual of interest status.      
    NOTE 4   SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS   
 The following table provides additional detail regarding repurchase agreements accounted for as secured borrowings.  
   
    NOTE 5   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   
 The Company provides disclosures about assets and liabilities carried at fair value. The framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three broad
levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:      

Level I: 
    
 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.  

Level II: 
    
 Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by corroborated or other means. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level II input
must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  

Level III: 
    
 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

   NOTE 5- FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  (CONTINUED)  
   
  The following table presents the assets reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by level within the fair value hierarchy. No liabilities are carried at fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. Equity securities and U.S. Treasury Notes are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. Obligations of U.S. government agencies,
mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and corporate bonds are valued at observable market data for similar assets.

   NOTE 5- FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  (CONTINUED)  
   
  The following table presents the assets measured on a nonrecurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at their fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, by level within the fair value hierarchy. Impaired loans are written down to fair value through the establishment of specific reserves. Techniques used to value the
collateral that secure the impaired loans include: quoted market prices for identical assets classified as Level I inputs; and observable inputs, employed by certified appraisers, for similar assets classified as Level II inputs. In cases where
valuation techniques included inputs that are unobservable and are based on estimates and assumptions developed by management based on the best information available under each circumstance, the asset valuation is classified as Level III inputs.
     
   The following table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
and for which the Company has utilized Level III inputs to determine fair value:      

(1) 
 Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include various inputs which are not identifiable.    

(2) 
 Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors. The range of liquidation expenses and other appraisal adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal.

   NOTE 6   FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
 The estimated fair values of recognized financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  
   
   For purposes of the above disclosures of estimated fair value, the following assumptions are used:  
  Cash and cash equivalents; Loans held for sale; Accrued interest receivable; Short-term borrowings and Accrued interest payable   
 The fair value of the above instruments is considered to be carrying value, classified as Level I in the fair value hierarchy.

   NOTE 6   FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  (CONTINUED)  
   
   Securities   
 The fair value of securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity which are measured on a recurring basis are determined primarily by obtaining
quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather
by relying on securities  relationship to other similar securities, classified as Level I or Level II in the fair value hierarchy.     Net loans
    The fair value for loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market inputs at which loans with similar terms and qualities
would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality. Where quoted market prices were available, primarily for certain residential mortgage loans, such market rates were utilized as estimates for fair value. Fair value of non-accrual loans is
based on carrying value, classified as Level III.     Bank-owned life insurance   
 The carrying amount of bank-owned life insurance is based on the cash surrender value of the policies and is a reasonable estimate of fair value, classified as
Level I.     Restricted stock     Restricted stock includes
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock and Federal Reserve Bank Stock. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of regulatory equity securities due to restrictions placed on their transferability. Fair value is based on carrying value,
classified as Level I.     Mortgage servicing rights   
 The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net servicing income. The valuation
model incorporates discounted cash flow and repayment assumptions based on management s best judgment. As a result, these rights are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy.
    Deposits     The fair value of certificates of deposit
is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rates are estimated using market rates currently offered for similar instruments with similar remaining maturities, resulting in a Level III classification. Demand,
savings, and money market deposit accounts are valued at the amount payable on demand as of quarter end, resulting in a Level I classification.     Other
borrowings     The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current borrowing rates
for similar types of borrowings, resulting in a Level III classification.    The Company also has unrecognized financial instruments at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. These financial instruments relate to commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. The aggregated contract amount of such financial instruments was approximately $157 million at September 30, 2016 and $138 million
at December 31, 2015. Such amounts are also considered to be the estimated fair values.    The fair value estimates of financial instruments are
made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument over the
value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Since no ready market exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are largely
based on judgments after considering such factors as future expected credit losses, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
    ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
 The following management s discussion and analysis focuses on the consolidated financial condition of the Company at September 30, 2016 as compared
to December 31, 2015, and the consolidated results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more
thorough understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION     Total assets were $654 million at
September 30, 2016 as compared to $650 million at December 31, 2015. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, net loans increased $40 million, funded by decreases in cash and cash and equivalents of $11 million and investments of $26
million. On the liability side, deposits declined by $3 million while repurchase agreements increased by $2 million.    Net loans increased $40 million, or
10%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase occurred as demand for both business and consumer loans within the bank s markets improved. The bank has added lending and operations staff to accommodate the increase in
demand. Commercial loans including commercial real estate loans increased $20 million, or 7%, while construction and land development loans increased $3 million, or 20%. Residential real estate loans increased $13 million, or 10%, and consumer
loans increased $4 million, or 47% from December 31, 2015. Home purchase activity has increased and consumers continued to refinance their mortgage loans for lower long-term fixed rates. Residential mortgage loan originations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $48 million and $35 million, respectively. Originations sold into the secondary market were $6 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $10 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The Bank originates and sells primarily fixed-rate thirty year mortgages into the secondary market.   The allowance for
loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.08% at September 30, 2016 as compared to 1.10% at December 31, 2015. Outstanding loan balances increased 10% to $463 million at September 30, 2016. A provision of $493 thousand, partially offset
by net charge-offs of $153 thousand, increased the allowance for loan losses to $5 million at September 30, 2016.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  Nonaccrual loans increased during the first nine months of 2016. For the nine months ending
September 30, 2016 loans totaling $1.4 million were placed on nonaccrual status, $85 thousand in charge-offs were recognized and pay downs of $303 thousand were received. It is anticipated that collection efforts on several of the
non-performing loans should result in repayment of their full carrying value.      
   The ratio of gross loans to deposits was 89% at September 30, 2016, compared to 81% at December 31, 2015.  
 The Company has no exposure to government-sponsored enterprise preferred stocks, collateralized debt obligations or trust preferred securities. Management has
considered industry analyst reports, sector credit reports and the volatility within the bond market in concluding that the gross unrealized losses of $241 thousand within the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of September 30,
2016, were primarily the result of customary and expected fluctuations in the bond market and not necessarily the expected cash flows of the individual securities. As a result, all security impairments on September 30, 2016, are considered
temporary and no impairment loss relating to these securities has been recognized.    Deposits decreased $3 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 with
noninterest bearing deposits increasing $9 million and interest-bearing deposit accounts decreasing $12 million. Total deposits as of September 30, 2016 are $17 million greater than September 30, 2015 deposit balances. On a year over year
comparison, increases were recognized in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.    Short-term borrowings consisting of overnight repurchase agreements with
retail customers increased $2 million to $51 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 and other borrowings decreased $1 million as the Company repaid FHLB advances with required monthly amortization. 
 Total shareholders  equity amounted to $65.8 million, or 10.0% of total assets, at September 30, 2016, compared to $61.3 million, or 9.4% of total
assets, at December 31, 2015. The increase in shareholders  equity during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was due to net income of $4.8 million and other comprehensive income of $1.3 million, partially offset by dividends
declared of $1.6 million. The Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2016.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     For the
quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded net income of $1.7 and $1.6 million and $0.61 and $0.57 per share, respectively. The $138 thousand increase in net income for the quarter was primarily the result of a $429
thousand increase in net interest income. The increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses of $164 thousand, a decline in noninterest income of $24 thousand and an increase in noninterest expenses of $50
thousand. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.03% and 10.29%, respectively, for the three month period of 2016, compared to 0.98% and 10.27%, respectively for the same quarter in 2015.

   Average Balance Sheets and Net Interest Margin Analysis   
   
   Interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $5.9 million representing a $401 thousand increase, or a 7%
improvement, compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to average loan volume increasing $49 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the third quarter 2015. Interest expense for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $366 thousand, a decrease of $28 thousand, or 7%, from the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense occurred due to the decrease in the average balance of time deposits, as well as rate
decreases on time deposits and other borrowings for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.    The provision for loan losses for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 was $164, compared to no provision for the same quarter in 2015. The provision for loan losses is determined based on management s calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which includes provisions for classified
loans as well as for the remainder of the portfolio based on historical data, including past charge-offs and current economic trends.    Noninterest income
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $1.1 million, a decrease of $24 thousand, or 2%, compared to the same quarter in 2015. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $14 thousand, or 4%, compared to the same quarter in 2015 primarily
from decreases in overdraft fees. Fees from trust and brokerage services increased $15 thousand to $213 thousand for the third quarter 2016 as compared to the same quarter in 2015 due to increased brokerage and trust fee income. The gain on the
sale of mortgage loans to the secondary market decreased to $71 thousand for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, from $114 thousand in the same quarter in 2015. The gain in 2015 was greater due to an additional volume of loans sold during
the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter 2016. Debit card interchange income increased $20 thousand, or 8%, with greater fee income in the third quarter of 2016.

  Noninterest expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $50 thousand, or 1%, compared to the
third quarter of 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased $97 thousand, or 4%, a result of increases in base salary, medical and other benefits. Professional and director fees increased $48 thousand for the quarter ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the third quarter 2015. The increase resulted from $40 thousand in retained search fees during third quarter 2016 to expand commercial lending. Debit card expenses increased $18 thousand, or 18%, compared to the third
quarter 2015 due to an increase in charge-backs. The charge-back expense should begin to decline as the Company continues to replace all outstanding debit cards with EMV chip cards. FDIC assessment declined $33 thousand due to the new rate
structure beginning third quarter 2016. Occupancy and equipment expenses decreased $19 thousand in 2016 over the third quarter of 2015 due to expense reductions that resulted from the reduction of office lease expense. Marketing and public
relations expense decreased $17 thousand over the prior year quarter.    Federal income tax expense increased $53 thousand, or 8%, for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. The provision for income taxes was $740 thousand (effective rate of 30.4%) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $687 thousand (effective rate of 30.6%) for the same
quarter ended 2015.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $4.8 million or $1.74 per share, as compared to
$4.4 million or $1.61 per share during the same period in 2015. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.99% and 9.99%, respectively, for the nine month period of 2016, compared to 0.94% and 9.95%, respectively for 2015. 
 Comparative net income increased as total interest and dividend income increased $900 thousand or 5% for the nine month period in 2016 as compared to 2015.
The provision for loan losses increased $104 thousand, or 27%, during the same comparative period. Noninterest income decreased $169 thousand to $3.2 million, or 5%, for the nine month period ending in 2016 as compared to 2015. Noninterest expense
increased to $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $179 thousand, or 2%, from the same period last year.

   Average Balance Sheet and Net Interest Margin Analysis   
   
   Interest income on loans increased $820 thousand, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same
period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an average loan volume increase of $31 million for the comparable nine month period. Interest income on securities increased $65 thousand, or 3%, as the average yield on securities
increased 0.01% to 2.43% on a fully taxable equivalent basis, while the volume of securities increased $5 million for the comparable nine month period. Interest income on fed funds sold and interest bearing deposits increased $15 thousand for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the yield on fed funds sold and due from banks interest bearing balances increased 42 basis points, compared to the same period in 2015.  
 Interest expense decreased $71 thousand to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Interest
expense on deposits decreased $57 thousand, or 7%, from the same period as last year, while interest expense on short-term and other borrowings decreased $14 thousand, or 4%. The decrease in interest expense has been caused by lower interest
rates being paid on time deposits and borrowings. Additionally, during the comparable nine month periods, the Company grew non-interest bearing deposits by $12 million in 2016. Time deposits continue to renew at lower interest rates, and
some depositors have moved monies to savings instruments anticipating higher interest rates. Competition for deposits appears to be increasing from a year ago with larger money center banks and community banks increasing rates offered for money
market savings accounts. The net interest margin increased by 10 basis points for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, to 3.61%, from 3.51% for the same period in 2015. This margin increase is primarily the result of increased loan
and investment volumes.   The provision for loan losses was $493 thousand during the nine months of 2016, compared to $389 thousand in the same nine month
period of 2015. The increase in the provision for loan losses from a year ago reflects an increase in the volume of loans compared to the same period in 2015. The provision  
      31

for loan losses is determined based on management s calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which includes provisions for classified loans as well as for the
remainder of the portfolio based on historical data including past charge-offs and current economic trends.    Non-interest income decreased $169 thousand
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. A loss on asset retirement of $64 thousand was recognized in other income during the nine month period in 2016. Gain on the sale of investments
decreased by $55 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Service charges on deposits decreased $49 thousand from the same period in 2015 reflecting a decrease in overdraft fees based on
volume. Decreases were recognized in gains on mortgage loans sold in the secondary market on a year over year basis as more loans were originated and retained for portfolio. Debit card interchange income increased $80 thousand, or 11%, as
a result of increased servicer revenue during the nine months of 2016.   Non-interest expenses increased $179 thousand, or 2%, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased $349 thousand, or 5%, primarily the result of salary and medical benefit increases. Marketing and public relations expense increased $36 thousand, or
13%, primarily due to expenses related to redesign of the company s website. Professional fees decreased $81 thousand, or 12%, as a one-time expense of $110 thousand was incurred during first quarter 2015 to contract a professional firm to
assist the company with assessment of market opportunities and long-term strategic goals. Loan legal and collection fees were $55 thousand for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to an $88 thousand recognized for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 as the Company recognized a greater recovery of overall legal billings in 2016. Software expense decreased $13 thousand for the nine month period in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The Bank s
telephone and data line expense decreased $33 thousand to $183 thousand for the nine months ended 2016 reflecting an expense reduction initiative for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015. Occupancy and equipment expense
decreased $54 thousand, or 4%, reflecting a decrease in building lease expense and an increase in building rental income when compared to 2015.    The
provision for income taxes of $2.1 million remained stable in 2016 from 2015 with an effective rate of 30.4% and 30.5%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
  CAPITAL RESOURCES     CSB maintained a strong capital
position with tangible common equity to tangible assets of 9.3% at September 30, 2016 compared with 8.8% at September 30, 2015.    Effective January 1, 2015
the Federal Reserve adopted final rules implementing Basel III and regulatory capital changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules apply to both the Company and the Bank. The rules established minimum risk-based and leverage capital
requirements for all banking organizations. The quality of capital will be provided by the new measurement of Tier 1 capital called common equity tier 1 or ( CET1 ). Effective with the March 31, 2015 Call Report the Bank selected the
opt-out election for accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). This election will neutralize the effects of unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities and other elements of the AOCI account for regulatory
capital purposes.    Consistent with the Board of Director s commitment to public confidence and safe and sound banking operations, capital targets and
minimum risk-based capital ratios for CSB were established to maintain excess capital to well-capitalized standards. To be considered well-capitalized, an institution must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a tier 1 capital ratio
of at least 8%, a leverage capital ratio of at least 5%, a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level. An adequately capitalized institution has a total
risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  Failure to meet specified minimum capital requirements could result in regulatory actions by the Federal
Reserve or Ohio Division of Financial Institutions that could have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Management believes there were no material changes to capital resources as presented in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016 the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.  
   
    LIQUIDITY       
   Liquidity refers to the Company s ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, meet deposit
withdrawals, pay operating expenses and meet other obligations. Liquidity is monitored by the Company s Asset Liability Committee. Other sources of liquidity include, but are not limited to, purchases of federal funds, advances from
the FHLB, adjustments of interest rates to attract deposits, brokered deposits and borrowing at the Federal Reserve discount window. Management believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet cash flow obligations for the
foreseeable future.    The liquidity ratio was 26.6% and 31.1% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS     The Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements (as such term is defined in applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
    ITEM 3  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks as of September 30, 2016, from the disclosures presented
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.   Management performs a quarterly analysis of the
Company s interest rate risk over a twenty-four month horizon. The analysis includes two balance sheet models, one based on a static balance sheet and one on a dynamic balance sheet with projected growth in assets and liabilities. Minor
variances with net interest income exceeding the board approved policy are being projected in the September 2016 dynamic balance sheet simulation coupled with immediate rate shocks. All other balance sheet positions and interest rate
projections are currently within the Company s board-approved policy.    The following table presents an analysis of the estimated sensitivity of the
Company s annual net interest income to sudden and sustained -100 through +400 basis point changes, in 100 basis point increments, in market interest rates at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The net interest income reflected is for
the first twelve month period of the modeled twenty-four month horizon. The underlying balance sheet for illustrative purposes is dynamic with projected growth in assets and liabilities.
