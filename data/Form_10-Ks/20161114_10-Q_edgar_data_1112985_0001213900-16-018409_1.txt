BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Delta International Oil   Gas Inc. ( Delta 
or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results
of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the
financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the
most recent fiscal year end December 31, 2015 as reported on Form 10-K, have been omitted.  

2.
RECEIVABLE FROM SALE OF BIDDING RIGHTS AND OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES  

On
March 30, 2012 the Company entered into the Cooperation Agreement with PPL. Under the Cooperation Agreement, PPL agreed to pay
us $7,000,000 for certain exploration and exploitation rights to oil and gas deposits and certain bidding rights held by Delta
on the following areas: Valle de Lerma in the province of Salta; San Salvador de Jujuy; Libertador General San Martin in the province
of Jujuy; and Selva Maria in the province of Formosa. Pursuant to a separate Agreement dated March 31, 2012, the Company agreed
with PPL to assign and transfer 50% of SAHF's current ownership of the Tartagal and Morillo (i.e., a 9% interest in the concession)
to PPL for a purchase price of $500,000. PPL had also agreed in an Undertaking to provide funds to the operating entities of Valle
de Lerma (the San Salvador, Libertador, and Selva Maria concessions were awarded to another party, whose bid exceeded that of
the Company for these concessions), in the aggregate amount of up to $10,000,000.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had received deposits in the amount of $4,299,891 from PPL on account. The remainder of the
proceeds was recorded as a $3,200,069 receivable from the sale of bidding rights and oil and gas properties. As of December
31, 2014, the Company provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of $3,200,069. Because of PPL s payment default, the Company
has not transferred the Tartagal, and Morillo interests. The Company, however, did incorporate High Luck Group (a subsidiary of
New Times Energy) into the official UTE for Valle de Lerma, as per PPL s request.  

In
July 2016, Delta and SAHF terminated all of their agreements with PPL with no further consideration as provided by the
MOU with New Times detailed in footnote 5. The final contract is still being worked on by the Parties.  

3.
INVESTMENTS IN MHD TECHNOLOGY  

We have made an investment of $125,000 in MHD Technology
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( MHD Tech ), for an equity position of 1,343,750 shares of common stock of MHD
Tech (approximately 6.25% of the outstanding shares in the company); this investment was made through a separate limited liability
company owned by Delta and set up specifically for this investment. In connection with the investment, Santiago Peralta, our Interim
Chief Executive Officer and sole director, has joined the Board of Directors of MHD Tech. The investment that Delta made into MHD
Tech will be primarily for research and development purposes. In November 2016, a simulation company from Florida finished a simulation
of the unit for MHD Tech to start selling licenses. The next step is building a working prototype that will establish the exact
specifications of the unit. 

This
investment is accounted for using the cost accounting method. The value of the investment on the balance sheet will be shown at
historical cost and will not be adjusted according to fair market value. If there is evidence that suggests that the fair market
value of the investment is lower than the historical cost, then the investment will be written down to its new fair market value.  

4.
POTENTIAL MANAGER BONUS  

Due
to the agreement reached between New Times Energy and Delta, and the commitments made in July 2015 for a manager bonus to Alberto
Mac Mullen and January 2016 for a negotiating commission for Enrique Vidal, the Company expects to have cash disbursements upwards
of $200,000 as the payment installments come into the Company.  

5.
ASSET SALE  

On
May 12, 2016, Delta and New Times Energy reached an agreement in principle for the sale of 18% of Tartagal Oriental and Morillo.
The two companies signed an MOU detailing the purchase amount, payment terms, and conditions on both sides, and a further Assignment
of Rights agreement, which is subject to closing conditions applicable to all parties to the agreement.  

The
total consideration for the 18% of Tartagal Oriental and Morillo is US$4,000,000. The initial payment of US$2,000,000 will be
placed in escrow at the signing and will be released when the official transfer of interest in the properties is completed. Additionally,
Delta will receive 3% of gross revenues of production of both oil and gas in the properties until an additional US$2 million are
paid. New Times has committed to drill 3 exploratory wells in the next 15 months in Tartagal and Morillo. The parties are working
on a final draft of the agreement and preparation for closing. Both companies are working in good faith to move forward but there
is no certainty that a contract will be finalized or that it will remain in the same terms.  

6.
VALLE DE LERMA CONCESSION  

The
oil and gas concession owned by SAHF in the Province of Salta, Argentina known as Valle de Lerma has been impaired and has a carrying
value of $0 as of September 30, 2016. The impairment expense at September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $191,236 and zero dollars, respectively.
The property was impaired as of September 30, 2016 because there is a likely scenario in which the property will be returned to
the government for no consideration. SAHF still holds title to the property. The property has around 205 work unit commitments
outstanding so Delta is looking at ways to transfer the property to an external party to free itself from that potential liability.  

ITEM 2.    
       MANAGEMENT'S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The
following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report.  

Certain
statements contained in this report, including, without limitation, statements containing the words  believes,   anticipates, 
 expects  and words of similar import, constitute  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Our
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors,
including our ability to create, sustain, manage or forecast our growth; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; changes
in our business strategy or development plans; competition; business disruptions; adverse publicity; and international, national
and local general economic and market conditions.  

GENERAL  

Delta
International Oil   Gas Inc. ( Delta  or  the Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on November 17,
1999. Our name was changed from Delta Mutual Inc. to our present name on October 29, 2013, by the merger with a wholly-owned Delaware
subsidiary, where the sole change resulting from the merger was the change of the Company s name to Delta International
Oil   Gas Inc. In 2003, we established business operations focused on providing environmental and construction technologies
and services. Our operations in the Far East (Indonesia) and our construction operations in Puerto Rico were discontinued in 2008.  

Effective
March 4, 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the parent of South American Hedge Fund
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (sometimes herein referred to as  SAHF ). For accounting purposes, the transaction
was treated as a recapitalization of the Company as of March 4, 2008, with the parent of SAHF as the acquirer. SAHF maintains
a branch office in Argentina, where it has made investments in oil and gas exploration and development activities.   

Overview    

We
are an independent oil and gas company, with the SIC Code classification 1311 (oil and gas production) for SEC filing purposes,
engaged in oil and gas acquisition and exploration activities in Argentina. Our operating policies have been to secure oil and
gas properties and concessions which are either producing economical quantities of oil and gas or which demonstrate favorable
characteristics for well  workovers  with a history of excellent production.  

Since
Mauricio Macri was sworn in as president on December 10, 2015, Argentina has been going through an aggressive reform agenda. In
the oil and energy sector, the President has focused on replacing key officials in the Energy Department across the country. He
is also in the process of replacing part of the top management and board of directors at the national oil company   YPF.
Currently, the oil and natural gas prices applicable domestically are artificially set at $67.50/bbl and up to $7.50/MCF, respectively,
in order to keep exploration attractive and to meet domestic energy needs. There are no restrictions for the payment abroad of
interest, dividends or profits, royalties and other commercial payments duly supported by the corresponding documentation. There
are presently no restrictions on foreign investment in the capital of local corporations.  

Investment
in MHD Technology Corporation   

The
Company is currently evaluating prospects for investments in fields other than oil and gas exploration and production, and we
have made an initial investment in MHD Tech, a company involved in development of a technology for the transportation and desalination
of water, using a specific propulsion technology that had been deemed uneconomic until present-day. We are actively involved in
the company in the development phase of the first product. Additionally, in the future, the Company will be involved in the distribution
and sales in foreign territories. Our investment was made in the first quarter of 2016.  

We
have made an investment of $125,000 in MHD Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( MHD Tech ), for an equity
position of 1,343,750 shares of common stock of MHD Tech (approximately 6.25% of the outstanding shares in the company); this
investment was made through a separate limited liability company owned by Delta and set up specifically for this investment. In
connection with the investment, Santiago Peralta, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and sole director, has joined the Board
of Directors. The investment that Delta made into MHD Tech will be primarily for research and development purposes. On November
9, 2016 MHD Tech received the simulation showcasing how the pump works and has raised another $300,000 from investors. Currently,
MHD Tech is teaming up with a PR firm to sign up distributors and working with one of the world s leading authorities in
fluid dynamics to produce an initial prototype. Initial figures have indicated commercial viability.  

Final
product specifications are expected to come from the prototype.  

Our
Oil and Gas Investments   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company, through SAHF, retained 18% of the total concession in the carryover mode ( no cost obligations
to SAHF ) in the Tartagal and Morillo oil and gas concessions located in Northern Argentina. We do not operate the Tartagal
and Morillo concession, and have a minority position in the joint venture. 9% of Tartagal and Morillo had been sold to PPL in
March 2012, but due to payment defaults, the 9% interest was not transferred. Tartagal and Morillo have a carrying value of $0
because 50% of its interest was sold for higher than the carrying cost in 2012. All contracts with PPL have been officially terminated
so the 18% of Tartagal and Morillo is owned free and clear.  

We
hold a 30.6% interest in the Valle de Lerma concession in Northern Argentina, where the joint venture partners are Grasta SA,
PetroNEXUS, High Luck Group, and REMSA. Valle de Lerma has a carrying value of $0 because the likely scenario that it will be
transferred to a third party for no consideration so that they can take care of the work unit commitments outstanding in the concession.  

29.4%
of the rights were sold to PPL under the PPL Agreement and High Luck Group was included in the UTE and the Operation
Agreement as 29.4% owners and a 50% liable for all expenses as requested by PPL. However, the official government decree
acknowledging High Luck Group as an owner has not yet been made. Delta has spent about $500,000 and complied with about
$800,000 of work unit commitments in relation to Valle de Lerma of which High Luck Group is liable for 50%. Additionally, the
end of the first period for Valle de Lerma was in March 2016, which the UTE is not looking to extend.  

The
exploration terms are four years for the first period, three years for the second and two years for the last period. Currently
our ability to reopen the existing well site is constrained by law, since the location of the well was within the city limits
of Salta. Requests made for government approval to override the existing restrictions of the current policy have been rejected.
The Company is looking to sell its full stake in Valle de Lerma.  

As
of the date of this report Delta and New Times Energy Corporation Limited were still working on finalizing an agreement for the
Company s sale of its 18% interest in Tartagal and Morillo for a total consideration of US$4 million. Once the agreement
is signed, there will be closing conditions that the parties must fulfill. At this time, there is no assurance that the parties
will be able to agree on a final agreement or, if agreement is reached, that closing conditions will be satisfied.  

Lithium
Mining Property   

On
March 1, 2010, SAHF purchased control of 51% of the Guayatayoc project via a partnership agreement with Oscar Chedrese and Servicios
Mineros SA. The project holds the concession for a period of 20 years for the mineral rights to 143,000 hectares with 29 mines
located in the Northwest part of Argentina, south of the border with Bolivia, with high lithium and borates brines concentration.
We have performed sampling in the property to determine the value of the property, but the results have been inconclusive. We
are seeking a purchaser for our concession interest in this property. Delta is not expecting a sale of the lithium property within
the next year due to 1) the current price of lithium, 2) lithium s abundance in the surrounding area, and 3) Delta s
primary focus on other projects. The concession was completely impaired and has a carrying value of $0 as of September 30, 2016.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS  

THREE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of approximately $84,000, compared to net loss of approximately
$146,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the net loss for the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to: lower general and administrative expenses in 2016
and a foreign exchange loss in 2015.   

NINE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of approximately $461,000, compared to net loss of approximately
$439,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to: an impairment charge of approximately $191,000 in 2016,
net of lower general and administrative expenses in 2016 and a foreign exchange loss in 2015.   

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  

At
September 30, 2016, we had a working capital surplus of approximately $305,000 compared with a working capital surplus of approximately
$697,000 at December 31, 2015.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had total assets of approximately $454,000 compared to total assets of approximately $945,000 at December
31, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $261,000, as compared
with net cash used in operating activities of $410,000 in 2015; net cash used in investing activities was $126,000 in 2016 and
$- in 2015; and net cash generated from financing activities was $-0 in 2016 and $12,000 in 2015.  

Effective
March 30, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Cooperation Agreement (the  Cooperation Agreement ) with Principle
Petroleum Limited ( PPL ), headquartered in the British Virgin Islands. Under the Cooperation Agreement, we agreed
to sell to PPL, for a price of $7,000,000 certain exploration and exploitation rights to oil and gas deposits and certain bidding
rights held by SAHF on the following areas: Valle de Lerma in the province of Salta; San Salvador de Jujuy; Libertador General
San Martin in the province of Jujuy; and Selva Maria in the province of Formosa. The San Salvador, Libertador, and Selva Maria
concessions have since been awarded by the government to another party. Pursuant to a separate Agreement dated March 31, 2012,
we agreed with PPL to assign and transfer 50% of SAHF's current ownership of the Tartagal and Morillo (i.e., a 9% interest in
the concession) to PPL for a purchase price of US$500,000. PPL had also agreed in an Undertaking to provide funds to the operating
entity of Valle de Lerma (and the other concessions, if our bid had been approved) in the aggregate amount of up to US $10,000,000.  

As
part of PPL s obligations under the Cooperation Agreement, PPL made partial payments of $2,000,000 in our 2012 first fiscal
quarter, $999,979 in the second quarter and $499,979 in the third quarter towards the full amount of $7,000,000 provided under
the Cooperation Agreement. Both parties are working to execute the full amount of PPL s payment obligations as agreed. Further
payments of $500,000, $50,000, $150,000, and $99,973 were made in January 2013, July 2014, August 2014, and November 2014, respectively.
The interests in the Tartagal and Morillo concessions have not been transferred to PPL due to PPL s payment defaults in
all agreements. High Luck Group has been included in the UTE Agreement and Operations Agreement for Valle de Lerma as per PPL s
request under the Cooperation Agreement. As of July 2016, all agreements with PPL had been terminated with no further consideration
on either side, fulfilling one of the conditions of the proposed agreement with New Times Energy Corporation Limited.  

Estimated
2016 Capital Requirements   

In
the case of the Tartagal and Morillo oil and gas properties, we have carried interests; therefore, no further capital expenditures
are required on our part.  

Valle
de Lerma s target well,  La Troja,  has been deemed inside the city limits, and, therefore, unable to be drilled.
Given the concession s limited number of other potential  workover  drills, and the Company s strategy
to not engage in any exploratory drilling, the cost of Valle de Lerma for 2016 is expected to be US$100,000 in canons and other
obligations. Additionally, there are 205 unfulfilled work unit commitments in the area which the UTE must satisfy. The Company
is currently looking for buyers for the property.  

SAHF
also has  minimum expected income  tax in Argentina. In the third quarter of 2015, SAHF spent about US$12,000 in minimum
expected income tax in Argentina to bring all of its tax positions up-to-date. Another minimum expected income tax is expected
to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016 in the amount of $15,000.  

In 2015, Delta considerably lowered its operating expenses
and SG As to look for other opportunities for investment in the energy industry. In the oil and gas sector, the focus is service-related
while in the alternative energies, the focus is in water propulsion systems and hydro-electric systems. 

USE
OF ESTIMATES  

The
preparation of the financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of
assets, liabilities, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company
evaluates its estimates, including those related to oil and gas properties, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies
and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included in these financial statements. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  

Management
believes that it is reasonably possible that the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could happen
in the coming two years:  

Reserve
    reports in two of the properties;   

Cash
    flow from exploratory drilling in two of the properties; and   

Future
    exploration and development costs that are carried.   

NEW
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

For
a summary of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company, please refer to the notes to the financial statements
set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The
Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued  Financial Reporting Release No. 60 Cautionary Advice About Critical
Accounting Policies  ( FRR 60 ), suggesting companies provide additional disclosures, discussion and commentary
on their accounting policies considered most critical to its business and financial reporting requirements. FRR 60 considers an
accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Company s financial condition and results of operations, and
requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in the application of the policy.  

The
Company assesses potential impairment of its long-lived assets, which include its property and equipment, investments, and its
identifiable intangibles such as deferred charges under the guidance of ASC 144  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets.  The Company must continually determine if a permanent impairment of its long-lived assets has occurred
and write down the assets to their fair values and charge current operations for the measured impairment.  

Investments
in non-consolidated affiliates   These investments consist of the Company s ownership interests in oil and gas development
and exploration rights in Argentina, net of impairment losses if any.  

We
evaluate these investments for impairment when indicators of potential impairment are present. Indicators of impairment include,
but are not limited to, levels of oil and gas reserves, availability of pipeline (or other transportation) capacity and infrastructure
and management of the operations in which the investments were made.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation to non-employees under ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation  ( ASC
718 ). The compensation cost of the awards is based on the grant date fair-value of these awards and recognized over the
requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine
the fair-value of stock options issued for compensation.  

The
Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards based upon ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. 
ASC 505-50 requires the costs of goods and services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments to be recognized using
the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity award, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair
value of the equity award is determined on the measurement date, which is the earlier of the date that a performance commitment
is reached or the date that performance is complete. Generally, our awards do not entail performance commitments. When an award
vests over time such that performance occurs over multiple reporting periods, we estimate the fair value of the award as of the
end of each reporting period and recognize an appropriate portion of the cost based on the fair value on that date. When the award
vests, we adjust the cost previously recognized so that the cost ultimately recognized is equivalent to the fair value on the
date the performance is complete.

Not
applicable to smaller reporting companies.   

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive and financial
officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the cost- benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  

As
of September 30, 2016, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

Changes
in Internal Controls   

There
have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's last fiscal
quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls   

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. The Company's chief
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective
at that reasonable assurance level.
