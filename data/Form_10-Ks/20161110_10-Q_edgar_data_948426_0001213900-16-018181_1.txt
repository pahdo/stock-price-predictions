THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Nature
of Organization   

Coates
International, Ltd. (the  Company  or  CIL ) has acquired the exclusive licensing rights to the patented
Coates spherical rotary valve ( CSRV    ) system technology in North America, Central America and South
America (the  CSRV    License ). The CSRV    system technology has been developed over a
period of more than 20 years by the Company s founder George J. Coates, President and Chief Executive Officer, and his son
Gregory G. Coates. The CSRV    system technology is adaptable for use in piston-driven internal combustion engines
of many types and has been patented in the United States and numerous countries throughout the world. The Company is endeavoring
to raise working capital to commence production of natural gas powered CSRV    industrial electric power generator
sets ( Gen Sets)  and is also seeking to enter into sublicense agreements with third party, original equipment manufacturers
( OEM s ) which provide for licensing fees. The Company is also continuing with research and development of
a hydrogen reactor to harvest Hydroxy-Gas from water with the intent to power the Company s products, including large industrial
Gen Sets. George J. Coates, owner of the hydrogen reactor technology, has committed to license this technology to the Company
once the related patent protection is in place.  

Management
believes that the CSRV    engines provide the following advantages as compared to conventional internal combustion
engines designed with  poppet valves :  

Improved
                                         fuel efficiency    

Lower
                                         levels of harmful emissions    

Adaptability
                                         to numerous types of engine fuels    

Longer
                                         engine life    

Longer
                                         intervals between engine servicing    

The
CSRV    system technology is designed to replace the intake and exhaust conventional  poppet valves 
currently used in almost all piston-driven, automotive, truck, motorcycle, marine and electric power generator engines, among
others. Unlike conventional valves which protrude into the engine combustion chamber, the CSRV    system technology
utilizes spherical valves that rotate in a cavity formed between a two-piece cylinder head. The CSRV    system technology
utilizes significantly fewer moving parts than conventional poppet valve assemblies. As a result of these design improvements,
management believes that engines incorporating the CSRV    system technology ( Coates Engines ) will
last significantly longer and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine, as compared to conventional engines.
In addition, CSRV    Engines can be designed with larger openings into the engine cylinder than with conventional
valves so that more fuel and air can be inducted into, and expelled from, the cylinder in a shorter period of time. Larger valve
openings permit higher revolutions-per-minute (RPM s) and permit higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber
temperatures, allowing the Coates Engine    to produce more power than equivalent conventional engines. The extent
to which, higher RPM s, greater volumetric efficiency and thermal efficiency can be achieved with the CSRV   
system technology, is a function of the engine design and application.  

Coates
International, Ltd. 
Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company. In the opinion of the Company s management,
the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for
fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the current period s presentation.  

These
condensed financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual financial
statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the Company s
quarterly financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the six months ended June
30, 2016 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  

Since
the Company s inception, the Company has been responsible for the development costs of the CSRV    technology
in order to optimize the value of the licensing rights and has incurred related operational costs, the bulk of which have been
funded primarily through cash generated from licensing fees, sales of stock, short term convertible promissory notes, capital
contributions, loans made by George J. Coates, Bernadette Coates, his spouse, Gregory G. Coates and certain directors, fees received
from research and development of prototype models and a small number of CSRV    engine generator sales. The Company
has incurred substantial cumulative losses from operations since its inception. Losses from operations are expected to continue
until the Coates Engines    are successfully introduced into and accepted in the marketplace enabling the Company
to generate substantial sales and/or receive substantial licensing revenues. These losses from operations were substantially related
to research and development of the Company s intellectual property rights, patent filing and maintenance costs and general
and administrative expenses. The Company has also incurred substantial non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation and remeasurement
of the estimated fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to convertible promissory notes issued.  

As
shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and, as of September
30, 2016, had a stockholders  deficiency of ($4,694,000). In addition, the current economic environment, which is characterized
by tight credit markets, investor uncertainty about how to safely invest their funds and low investor confidence, has introduced
additional risk and difficulty to the Company s challenge to secure needed additional working capital. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has instituted a cost control program
intended to restrict variable costs to only those expenses that are necessary to complete its activities related to entering the
production phase of operations, develop additional commercially feasible applications of the CSRV    system technology,
seek additional sources of working capital and cover general and administrative costs in support of such activities. The Company
has been actively undertaking efforts to secure new sources of working capital. At September 30, 2016, the Company had negative
working capital of ($4,905,000) compared with negative working capital of ($5,476,000) at the end of 2015.  

The
Company continues to actively seek out new sources of working capital; however, there can be no assurance that it will be successful
in these efforts. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Coates
International, Ltd. 
Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These significant estimates
include determining the fair value of convertible promissory notes containing embedded derivatives and variable conversion rates,
determining a value for shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued, assigning useful lives
to the Company s property, plant and equipment, determining an appropriate amount to reserve for obsolete and slow moving
inventory, estimating a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assigning expected lives to, and estimating the rate of forfeitures
of, stock options granted and selecting a trading price volatility factor for the Company s common stock in order to estimate
the fair value of the Company s stock options on the date of grant or other appropriate measurement date. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

2.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND BUSINESS RISK   

The
Company maintains a cash balance with one financial institution. Monies on deposit are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  

The
Company s operations are devoted to the development, application and marketing of the CSRV    system technology
which was invented by George J. Coates, the Company s founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and controlling
stockholder. Development efforts have been conducted continuously during this time. From July 1982 through May 1993, seven U.S.
patents as well as a number of foreign patents were issued with respect to the CSRV    system technology. Since inception
of the Company in 1988, all aspects of the business have been completely dependent upon the activities of George J. Coates. The
loss of George J. Coates  availability or service due to death, incapacity or otherwise would have a material adverse effect
on the Company's business and operations. The Company does not presently have any key-man life insurance in force for Mr. Coates.  

3.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

Cash,
Other Assets, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities and Other Liabilities   

With
the exception of convertible promissory notes, the carrying amount of these items approximates their fair value because of the
short term maturity of these instruments. The convertible promissory notes are reported at their estimated fair value, determined
as described in more detail in Note 14.  

Limitations   

Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  

4.
LICENSING AGREEMENT AND DEFERRED LICENSING COSTS   

The
Company holds a manufacturing, use, lease and sale license from George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates for the CSRV  
 system technology in the territory defined as the Western Hemisphere (the  License Agreement ). Under the License
Agreement, George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates granted to the Company an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up
license to the patented intellectual property that specifically relates to an internal combustion engine that incorporates the
CSRV    system technology (the  CSRV    Engine ) and that is currently owned or controlled
by them (the  CSRV    Intellectual Property ), plus any CSRV    Intellectual Property that
is developed by them during their employment with the Company. In the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, the licensed
rights would terminate and ownership would revert back to George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates.  

Coates
International, Ltd. 
Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

Under
the License Agreement, George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates agreed that they will not grant any Western Hemisphere licenses
to any other party with respect to the CSRV    Intellectual Property.  

At
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, deferred licensing costs, comprised of expenditures for patent costs incurred pursuant
to the CSRV    licensing agreement, net of accumulated amortization, amounted to $39,000 and $42,000, respectively.
Amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $1,000 and $1,000, respectively. Amortization
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $3,000 and $3,000, respectively.  

5.
AGREEMENTS ASSIGNED TO ALMONT ENERGY, INC.   

Almont
Energy Inc. ( Almont ), a privately held, independent third-party entity based in Alberta, Canada is the assignee
of a sublicense which provides for a $5,000,000 license fee to be paid to the Company and covers the use of the CSRV  
 system technology in the territory of Canada in the oil and gas industry (the  Canadian License ). Almont is
also the assignee of a separate research and development agreement ( R D Agreement ) which requires that Almont
pay the remaining balance of an additional $5,000,000 fee to the Company in consideration for the development and delivery of
certain prototype engines. The Company completed development of the prototypes in accordance with this agreement at the end of
2007. The R D Agreement has not been reduced to the form of a signed, written agreement.  

Almont
is also the assignee of an escrow agreement (the  Escrow Agreement ) that provides conditional rights to a second
sublicense agreement from the Company for the territory of the United States (the  US License ). The US
License has been deposited into an escrow account and the grant of the license will not become effective until the conditions
for release from escrow are satisfied. The US License provides for a license fee of $50 million.   

The
Escrow Agreement requires that Almont, as the assignee, make a payment ( Release Payment ) to the Company equal to
the then remaining unpaid balance of the Canadian License licensing fee, the R D Agreement fee and the down payment of $1,000,000
required under the US License. It is not likely that Almont will be able to make additional payments of the Release Payment until
the Company can raise sufficient new working capital to commence production and ship Gen Sets to Almont. At September 30, 2016,
the remaining balance of the Release Payment due to the Company was $5,847,000.  

6.
NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION SUBLICENSE WITH RENOWN POWER DEVELOPMENT, LTD.   

In
February 2015, the Company granted a non-exclusive distribution sublicense to Renown Power Development, Ltd., a China-based
sales and distribution company ( Renown ) covering the territory defined as the Western Hemisphere. Under this
sublicense, Renown will be permitted to sell, lease and distribute CSRV    products. This sublicense provides
for payment of licensing fees to the Company amounting to US$100 million. In 2014, the Company received an initial
non-refundable deposit of US$498,000. In addition, after Renown receives aggregate cash flow of US$10,000,000, it is required
to pay the Company 25% of all funds it receives from any and all sources until the entire balance of US$100 million licensing
fee is paid in full. In the event that Renown completes one or more capital raises aggregating US$300 million or more, the
remaining unpaid balance of the US$100 million licensing fee shall become immediately due and payable. The rights and
obligations per the agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire patent and any improvement patents
added thereto.  

As
collateral for payment of the sublicensing fee, Coates Power, Ltd. an independent China-based manufacturing company that will
produce CSRV    products in China ( Coates Power ) and Renown are to place shares of their capital stock
representing a 25% ownership interest into an escrow account for the benefit of the Company. These shares of stock will be released
from escrow and revert back to Coates Power and Renown only after the US$100 million sublicensing fee is paid in full. The Company
does not have an ownership interest in Coates Power or Renown. Coates Power and Renown are controlled and managed by Mr. James
Pang, the Company s liaison agent in China.  

Coates
International, Ltd. 
Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

Coates
Power has agreed to initially source its production parts and components from the Company. In February 2015, the Company received
an order from Coates Power for approximately $131,000 of production parts and components, at cost, in connection with its plans
to manufacture two initial Gen Sets. In June, 2015, by mutual consent of the parties, it was agreed that the Company would assemble
two completed Gen Sets for shipment to Coates Power in China in lieu of shipping the parts and components. This amount is included
in deposits in the accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  

7.
INVENTORY   

Inventory
consisted of the following:  

8.
LICENSE DEPOSITS   

License
deposits consist of monies received as deposits on sublicense agreements, primarily comprised of deposits from Renown in the
amount of $498,000 and from Almont in the amount of $300,000. These deposits are to be recognized as income on a
straight-line basis over the remaining period until expiration of the last remaining CSRV    patent in force in
2027. Through September 30, 2016, the Company has recognized a total of $106,000 of the Almont deposit as revenue.  Based on
ongoing planning with the government of China, the Company expects that sublicense-related activities by Renown may commence
within the next twelve months and that it will begin recognizing revenue at that time. Recognition of revenue from the Almont
license is included in the statements of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
The current portion of the license deposits represents the portion of the license deposits expected to be recognized as
revenue within one year from the balance sheet date. The balance of the license deposits is included in non-current
license deposits.  

Sublicensing
fee revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $5,000 and $5,000, respectively. Sublicensing fee
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $14,000 and $14,000, respectively.  

9.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT   

Property,
plant and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation, consist of the following:

expense amounted to $11,000 and $12,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Depreciation expense
amounted to $33,000 and $37,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

10.
MORTGAGE LOAN PAYABLE   

The
Company has a mortgage loan on the land and building that serves as its headquarters and research and development facility which
bears interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum and matures in July 2018. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 amounted to $26,000 and $28,000, respectively. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 amounted to $78,000 and $73,000, respectively. The loan requires monthly payments of interest, plus $5,000 which is being
applied to the principal balance. The remaining principal balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $1,343,000 and
$1,388,000, respectively. The mortgage loan may be prepaid in whole, or, in part, at any time without penalty.  

The
loan is collateralized by a security interest in all of the Company s assets, the pledge of five million shares of common
stock of the Company owned by George J. Coates, which were deposited into escrow for the benefit of the lender and the personal
guarantee of George J. Coates. The Company is not permitted to create or permit any secondary mortgage or similar liens on the
property or improvements thereon without prior consent of the lender.

FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATION   

In
August 2013, the Company entered into a sale/leaseback financing arrangement pursuant to which it sold its research and development
and manufacturing equipment in consideration for net cash proceeds of $133,000. This lease terminated in February 2016, upon which
the Company reacquired title to the equipment. The effective interest rate on this lease was 36.6%.  

In
accordance with GAAP, this sale/leaseback was required to be accounted for as a financing lease. Under this accounting method,
the equipment and accumulated depreciation remained on the Company s books and records as if the Company still owned the
equipment.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expense amounted to $-0- and $7,000, respectively. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expense amounted to $2,000 and $26,000, respectively. These amounts are included in
interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations.

14. CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTES AND EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILITY   

From
time to time, the Company issues convertible promissory notes, the proceeds of which are used for general working capital purposes.
At September 30, 2016, there was $124,000 principal amount of convertible promissory notes outstanding. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $165,000 and $676,000 of convertible promissory notes were issued, respectively. Outstanding
notes may be converted into unregistered shares of the Company s common stock at a discount ranging from 30% to 38% of the
defined trading price of the common stock on the date of conversion. The defined trading prices are based on the trading price
of the stock during a defined period ranging from fifteen to twenty-five trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion.
The conversion rate discount establishes a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ) or unamortized discount, which is
required to be valued and accreted to interest expense over the six-month period until the conversion of the notes into restricted
shares of common stock is permitted. In addition, the conversion formula meets the conditions that require accounting for convertible
notes as derivative liability instruments. The effective interest rate on the outstanding convertible notes at September 30, 2016
ranged from 147% to 183%. The unamortized discount on the outstanding convertible notes at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 amounted to $62,000 and $150,000, respectively.  

Coates
International, Ltd. 
Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

The
convertible notes generally become convertible, in whole, or in part, beginning on the six month anniversary of the issuance date
and may be prepaid at the option of the Company, generally with a prepayment penalty equal to 50% of the principal amount of the
convertible note at any time prior to becoming eligible for conversion.  

One
convertible promissory note with a balance of $50,000 is convertible in monthly installments in an amount determined by the noteholder
of up to $50,000, plus accrued interest. The Company may elect, at its option to repay each monthly installment in whole, or in
part, in cash, without penalty. The amount of each installment not paid in cash is converted into shares of the Company s
common stock. This convertible note also requires that the conversion price be re-measured 23 trading days after the conversion
shares are originally delivered. If the re-measured conversion price is lower, then the Company is required to issue additional
conversion shares to the noteholder.  

In
accordance with GAAP, the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative liability related to the convertible notes is required
to be remeasured at each balance sheet date. The fair value measurement accounting standard establishes a valuation hierarchy
for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs
by requiring that the most observable inputs be used, when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use
in valuing the asset or liability developed based on independent market data sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect
the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based
upon the best information available. The valuation hierarchy is composed of three categories, which are as follows:  

Level
                                         1   Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
                                         or liabilities.    

Level
                                         2   Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities,
                                         quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
                                         active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,
                                         either directly or indirectly.    

Level
                                         3   Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs or valuation techniques.    

The
estimated fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to promissory notes outstanding was measured as the aggregate
estimated fair value, based on Level 2 inputs, which included the average of the quoted daily yield curve rates on six-month and
one-year treasury securities and, because the actual volatility rate on the Company s common stock is not available, a conservative
estimated volatility rate of 200%.  

The
embedded derivative liability arises because, based on historical trading patterns of the Company s stock, the formula for
determining the Conversion Rate is expected to result in a different Conversion Rate than the closing price of the stock on the
actual date of conversion (hereinafter referred to as the  Variable Conversion Rate Differential ). The estimated
fair values of the derivative liabilities have been calculated based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Preferred
Stock and anti-dilution rights   

The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value, $0.001 per share (the  Preferred Stock ).
The Company may issue any class of the Preferred Stock in any series. The board is authorized to establish and designate series,
and to fix the number of shares included in each such series and the relative rights, preferences and limitations as between series,
provided that, if the stated dividends and amounts payable on liquidation are not paid in full, the shares of all series of the
same class shall share ratably in the payment of dividends including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums which
would be payable on such shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full and in any distribution of assets other than by
way of dividends in accordance with the sums which would be payable on such distribution if all sums payable were discharged in
full. Shares of each such series when issued, shall be designated to distinguish the shares of each series from shares of all
other series.  

There
are two series of Preferred Stock that have been designated to date from the total 100,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred
Stock. These are as follows:  

Series
                                         A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series A ), 1,000,000 shares

                                         and December 31, 2015, respectively. Shares of Series A entitle the holder to 10,000
                                         votes per share on all matters brought before the shareholders for a vote. These shares
                                         are not entitled to receive dividends or share in distributions of capital and have no
                                         liquidation preference. All outstanding shares of Series A are owned by George J. Coates.

Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

In
the event that either (i) the Company enters into an underwriting agreement for a secondary public offering of securities, or
(ii) a change in control of the Company is consummated representing 50% more of the then outstanding shares of Company s
common stock, plus the number of shares of common stock into which any convertible preferred stock is convertible, regardless
of whether or not such shares are otherwise eligible for conversion, then the Series B may be immediately converted at the option
of the holder into restricted shares of the Company s common stock.     

The
Company has anti-dilution provisions in place for key executives which are triggered upon the issuance of new shares of its common
stock to individuals that are not direct Coates family members or entities that are not controlled by Coates family members. These
anti-dilution provisions do not apply to new shares of common stock issued in connection with exercises of employee stock options,
a secondary public offering of the Company s securities or a merger or acquisition. These provisions are as follows:  

For
                                         each such new share of common stock issued, shares of Series B will be issued to Mr.
                                         Coates equal to that number of shares of Series B required to maintain his ownership
                                         percentage of shares of common stock outstanding on a pro forma basis, at 78%, which
                                         was his ownership percentage as of December 31, 2002. As a result of the conversions
                                         of Mr. Coates  promissory notes into 570,458,147 shares of common stock, as discussed
                                         in Note 13, his ownership percentage to be maintained through anti-dilution increased
                                         to 83.5%.    

For
                                         each such new share of common stock issued, shares of Series B will be issued to Gregory
                                         G. Coates in order to maintain his ownership percentage of common stock at 5.31% of the
                                         pro forma number of shares of common stock outstanding, assuming all shares of Series
                                         B were converted into common stock. This was his percentage ownership of common stock
                                         at December 31, 2002.    

For
                                         each such new share of common stock issued, shares of Series B will be issued to Barry
                                         C. Kaye in order to maintain his ownership percentage of common stock at a calculated
                                         percentage of the pro forma number of shares of common stock outstanding, assuming all
                                         shares of Series B were converted into common stock. This calculated percentage, which
                                         was 0.04157% at  September 30, 2016, is equal to the weighted average percentage ownership
                                         of common stock he purchased, based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding
                                         on each date he acquired shares of common stock. This percentage is subject to adjustment
                                         if he acquires or disposes of shares of the Company s common stock in the future.

based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2016, this would dilute the ownership percentage of
non-affiliated stockholders from 71.3% to 8.5%.  

To
the extent that additional shares of Series B are issued under the anti-dilution plan, the non-affiliated stockholders 
percentage ownership of the Company would be further diluted.

UNEARNED REVENUE   

Unearned
revenue at September 30, 2016, consisted of the following:  

A
                                         deposit received with an order for two CSRV  Gen Sets from Coates Power, Ltd., a
                                         China-based unaffiliated manufacturing company in the amount of $132,000.    

A
                                         $19,000 non-refundable deposit from Almont in connection with its order for a natural
                                         gas fueled electric power CSRV  engine generator.    

17. SUBLICENSING
FEE REVENUE   

Sublicensing
fee revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $5,000 and $5,000, respectively. Sublicensing fee
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $14,000 and $14,000, respectively. The Company is recognizing
the license deposit of $300,000 on the Canadian License as revenue on a straight-line basis over the approximate remaining life
until 2027 of the last CSRV    technology patent in force.  

18.
LOSS PER SHARE   

At
September 30, 2016, there were stock warrants outstanding to purchase 90,344,911 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging
from $0.0005 to $0.12 per share, vested stock options outstanding to acquire 12,470,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices
ranging from $0.028 to $0.44 per share and $50,000 of convertible promissory notes eligible for conversion, which on a pro forma
basis, assuming they would have been converted on September 30, 2016, would have been convertible into 100,531,899 shares of common
stock.

Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

At
September 30, 2015, there were stock warrants outstanding to purchase 35,344,911 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging
from $0.02 to $0.35 per share and vested stock options outstanding to acquire 12,500,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices
ranging from $0.028 to $1.00 per share and $79,000 of convertible promissory notes eligible for conversion.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, none of the potentially issuable shares of common stock were assumed to be
converted because the Company incurred a net loss in those periods and the effect of including them in the calculation of earnings
per share would have been anti-dilutive.

STOCK OPTIONS   

The
Company s 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the  Stock Plan ) was adopted by the Company s board in
October 2006. In September 2007, the Stock Plan, by consent of George J. Coates, majority shareholder, was adopted by our shareholders.
The Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock-based awards to employees, officers and directors of, and consultants or advisors
to, the Company and its subsidiaries, if any. Under the Stock Plan, the Company may grant options that are intended to qualify
as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( ISO s ),
options not intended to qualify as incentive stock options ( non-statutory options ), restricted stock and other stock-based
awards. ISO s may be granted only to employees of the Company. All of the shares of common stock authorized under the Stock
Plan have been granted and no further grants may be awarded thereunder.  

The
Company established a 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the  2014 Stock Plan ) which was adopted by the Company s
board on May 30, 2014. On March 2, 2015, the 2014 Stock Plan, by consent of George J. Coates, majority shareholder, was adopted
by our shareholders. The 2014 Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock-based awards to employees, officers and directors of,
and consultants or advisors to, the Company and its subsidiaries, if any. Under the 2014 Stock Plan, the Company may grant ISO s,
non-statutory options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. ISO s may be granted only to employees of the Company.
A total of 50,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued upon the exercise of options or other awards granted under the 2014
Stock Plan. The maximum number of shares with respect to which awards may be granted during any one year to any employee under
the 2014 Stock Plan shall not exceed 25% of the 50,000,000 shares of common stock covered by the 2014 Stock Plan. At September
30, 2016, none of the shares of common stock authorized under the 2014 Stock Plan had been granted as stock options or awards.  

The
Stock Plan and the 2014 Stock Plan (the  Stock Plans ) are administered by the board and the Compensation Committee.
Subject to the provisions of the Stock Plans, the board and the Compensation Committee each has the authority to select the persons
to whom awards are granted and determine the terms of each award, including the number of shares of common stock subject to the
award. Payment of the exercise price of an award may be made in cash, in a  cashless exercise  through a broker, or
if the applicable stock option agreement permits, shares of common stock, or by any other method approved by the board or Compensation
Committee. Unless otherwise permitted by the Company, awards are not assignable or transferable except by will or the laws of
descent and distribution.  

Upon
the consummation of an acquisition of the business of the Company, by merger or otherwise, the board shall, as to outstanding
awards (on the same basis or on different bases as the board shall specify), make appropriate provision for the continuation
of such awards by the Company or the assumption of such awards by the surviving or acquiring entity and by substituting on an
equitable basis for the shares then subject to such awards either (a) the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding
shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition, (b) shares of stock of the surviving or acquiring corporation,
or (c) such other securities or other consideration as the board deems appropriate, the fair market value of which (as determined
by the board in its sole discretion) shall not materially differ from the fair market value of the shares of common stock subject
to such awards immediately preceding the acquisition. In addition to, or in lieu of the foregoing, with respect to outstanding
stock options, the board may, on the same basis or on different bases as the board shall specify, upon written notice to the affected
optionees, provide that one or more options then outstanding must be exercised, in whole or in part, within a specified number
of days of the date of such notice, at the end of which period such options shall terminate, or provide that one or more options
then outstanding, in whole or in part, shall be terminated in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of the fair market
value (as determined by the board in its sole discretion) for the shares subject to such stock options over the exercise price
thereof. Unless otherwise determined by the board (on the same basis or on different bases as the board shall specify), any
repurchase rights or other rights of the Company that relate to a stock option or other award shall continue to apply to consideration,
including cash, that has been substituted, assumed or amended for a stock option or other award pursuant to these provisions.
The Company may hold in escrow all or any portion of any such consideration in order to effectuate any continuing restrictions.

Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

The
board may at any time provide that any stock options shall become immediately exercisable in full or in part, that any restricted
stock awards shall be free of some or all restrictions, or that any other stock-based awards may become exercisable in full or
in part or free of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise realizable in full or in part, as the case may be.  

The
board or Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend, modify or terminate any award granted or made under the Stock
Plan, so long as such amendment, modification or termination would not materially and adversely affect the participant.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 no stock options were granted. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, no stock
options were granted and 703,000 stock options with an exercise price of $0.028 per share became vested. There were no unvested
stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not incur any stock-based compensation expense related to
employee stock options. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded non-cash stock-based compensation
expense related to employee stock options amounting to $-0- and $7,000, respectively. At September 30, 2016, all stock-based
compensation expense related to outstanding stock options had been fully recognized.  

Details
of the stock options outstanding under the Company s Stock Option Plans are as follows:  

No
stock options were exercised, forfeited or expired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

The
weighted average fair value of the Company's stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. These assumptions were as follows:  

Coates
International, Ltd. 
Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

The
valuation assumptions were determined as follows:  

Historical
    stock price volatility: The Company utilized the volatility in the trading of its common stock computed for the 12 months
    of trading immediately preceding the date of grant.   

Risk-free
    interest rate: The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect
    at the time of the grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected option life.   

Expected
    life: The expected life of the options represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding. The Company has
    very limited historical data on which to base this estimate. Accordingly, the Company estimated the expected life based on
    its assumption that the executives will be subject to frequent blackout periods during the time that the stock options will
    be exercisable and based on the Company s expectation that it will complete its research and development phase and commence
    its initial production phase. The vesting period of these options was also considered in the determination of the expected
    life of each stock option grant.   

No
    expected dividends.

EQUITY PURCHASE AND REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENTS    

Southridge
Partners II LP   

In
July 2014, the Company entered into a 3-year equity purchase agreement (the  2014 EP Agreement ) with Southridge Partners
II LP, a Delaware limited partnership ( Southridge ). Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 EP Agreement, Southridge committed
to purchase up to 40,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, in exchange for consideration not to exceed Ten Million
($10,000,000) Dollars. In June 2015, the 2014 Agreement automatically terminated because Southridge had purchased all 40,000,000
shares of common stock permitted under thereunder. Accordingly, on July 29, 2015, the Company entered into a new 3-year equity
purchase agreement (the  2015 EP Agreement ) with Southridge. Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 EP Agreement, Southridge
committed to purchase up to 205,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for consideration not to exceed
Twenty Million ($20,000,000) Dollars on the same terms and conditions as the 2014 EP Agreement.  

The
terms of the 2014 and 2015 EP Agreements provided that the purchase price for the shares of common stock shall be equal to 94%
of the lowest closing price of the common stock during the ten trading days that comprise the defined pricing period. The Company
is entitled to exercise a Put to Southridge by delivering a Put Notice, which requires Southridge to remit the dollar amount stated
in the Put Notice at the end of the pricing period, provided, however, that for each day during the pricing period, if any, that
the daily closing price of the Company s common stock is (i) 25% or more below the Floor Price, as defined, or (ii) below
the Floor Price, if any, stipulated in the Put Notice issued by the Company, then the dollar amount of the Put shall be reduced
by 10% for each such day. The Company may stipulate a Floor Price below which, no shares of common stock may be sold by Southridge,
however, the Floor price shall not be lower than the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the common stock during the
ten trading days preceding the date of the Put Notice.  

The
Company also entered into a registration rights agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ) with Southridge. Pursuant
to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, on July 30, 2015, the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC covering
205,000,000 shares of common stock underlying the 2015 EP Agreement, which was declared effective August 5, 2015.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold 87,892,603 registered shares of common stock to Southridge and received
proceeds of $150,000 under the 2015 EP Agreement.  

Coates

Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company (i) sold all of the 40,000,000 registered shares of common stock to Southridge
and received proceeds of $207,000, thereby resulting in the termination of this 2014 EP Agreement, and (ii) sold 5,910,165 registered
shares of common stock to Southridge and received proceeds of $51,000 under the 2015 EP Agreement.  

21.
INCOME TAXES   

Deferred
income taxes are determined using the liability method for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and
income tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are measured based on the tax rates expected
to be in effect when the temporary differences are included in the Company s tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  

Deferred
tax assets increased by $1,750,000 and $589,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Deferred
tax assets increased by $3,145,000 and $3,473,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts
were fully offset by a corresponding increase in the tax valuation allowance resulting in no net change in deferred tax assets,
respectively, during these periods.  

No
liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Based
on the Company's evaluation, it has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the
Company's financial statements. The Company's evaluation was performed for tax years ended 2013 through 2015, the only periods
subject to examination. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and
does not anticipate that adjustments, if any, will result in a material change to its financial position. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no penalties or interest related to the Company s income tax returns.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had available, $20,069,000 of net operating loss carryforwards which may be used to reduce future
federal taxable income, expiring between 2018 and 2036 and $9,767,000 of net operating loss carryforwards which may be used to
reduce future state taxable income, expiring between 2029 and 2036.

Compensation
and Benefits Paid   

The
approximate amount of compensation and benefits, all of which were approved by the board, paid to George J. Coates, Gregory G.
Coates and Bernadette Coates, exclusive of stock-based compensation for unregistered, restricted shares of Preferred Stock awarded
to George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates and non-cash, stock-based compensation for employee stock options granted to Gregory
G. Coates is summarized as follows:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Barry C. Kaye, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer was paid compensation
of $1,000 and $73,000, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Mr. Kaye earned compensation of $25,000
and $26,000, respectively, which was not paid and is being deferred until the Company has sufficient working capital to remit
payment to him. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Mr. Kaye earned compensation of $74,000 and $87,000, respectively,
which was not paid and is being deferred until the Company has sufficient working capital to remit payment to him. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Kaye interest on the balance of his deferred compensation
retroactive to when it began being deferred in May 2012 and, accordingly, recorded interest expense of $90,000. This amount is
reflected in interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.
Interest continues to be accrued on the unpaid balance thereafter. At September 30, 2016, the total amount of Mr. Kaye s
unpaid, deferred compensation, including accrued interest thereon, was $270,000. This amount is included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, Barry C. Kaye was awarded 60,487 and 13,131 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively, with an estimated
fair value of $35,000 and $37,000, respectively, for anti-dilution.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

Revenue
Recognition   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting
standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity
expects to be entitled to when products are transferred to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09
for one year and permits early adoption. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of 2018 or
2019.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10 ), which amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance
obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-10 with ASU 2014-09. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard, as amended, but does not expect it to have
a material impact on its financial statements.  

Stock
Compensation   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which simplified certain
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification
in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2018. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new stock compensation standard, but does not expect it to have a material
impact on its financial statements.  

Financial
Instruments   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10) ( ASU 2016-01 ),
which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will
be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of the new financial
instruments standard will have a material impact on its financial statements.  

Coates
International, Ltd. 
Notes to Financial Statements - (Continued)  

Inventory
Measurement   

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) .
This update requires that inventory value be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
Currently, generally accepted accounting principles require that inventory be valued at the lower of cost or market price to replace
the inventory. This update is to become effective for annual and interim financial statements for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. This update is required to be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this update; however, at this time it does not expect it will have a material impact on its financial statements.

Background   

We
have completed development of the Coates    spherical rotary valve engine technology. This technology has been successfully
applied to natural gas fueled industrial electric power CSRV    generator engines ( Gen Sets ), automobile
engines, residential generators and high performance racing car engines. We have also designed and retrofitted the CSRV  
 system technology into a diesel engine which is suitable for and can be applied to heavy trucks.  

In
the second quarter of 2016, we successfully completed work on a new natural gas powered industrial electric, 14.0-liter engine
generator, by substantially retrofitting a new generator from Cummins Power Systems to incorporate our CSRV    system
technology, along with a number of engineering design changes. We are currently demonstrating this unit in connection with prospective
transactions in negotiations. This unit is expected to serve as the basis of our global design standard for large scale manufacturing.  

In
February 2015, we granted a US$100 million non-exclusive distribution sublicense to a China-based sales and distribution company
that covers distribution in the territory of the Western Hemisphere. We also undertook to procure parts and components to commence
limited production of our Gen Sets.  

Independent
testing on internal combustion engines incorporating the CSRV    system technology indicated the following advantages
would be derived from this technology:  

Better fuel efficiency   

Reduced harmful emissions   

Based
on more than ten years of operating a Mercedes 300 with an SE 280 engine retrofitted with the CSRV    system technology,
the following advantages were demonstrated:  

Longer intervals between engine servicing, and   

Longer engine life than conventional internal combustion
engines.   

We
continue to be engaged in new research and development activities from time-to-time in connection with applying this technology
to other commercially feasible internal combustion engine applications and intend to manufacture engines and/or license the CSRV  
 system technology to third party Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEM s ) for multiple other applications
and uses.  

Hydrogen
Reactor Technology Owned by George J. Coates   

George
J. Coates has developed a hydrogen reactor, which rearranges H 2 O water molecules into HOH molecules also known as Hydroxy-Gas.
The Hydroxy-Gas produced by the hydrogen reactor is then harvested for use as a type of fuel. Mr. Coates has agreed to continue
further development of this technology to enable the harvested Hydroxy-Gas to be utilized as the fuel source to power our patented
CSRV    engines. This technology has been successfully applied to a small CSRV    engine which is solely
powered by Hydroxy-Gas produced by the reactor from water. In addition, the Company and WTF Asia International Ltd. ( WTF ),
a Hong Kong-based entity have agreed to work together to develop this technology to enable it to be applied to large industrial
Gen Set engines. The Company has fulfilled its obligations under this joint project by designing and integrating the switchgears,
controls, load bank and emission equipment into the hydrogen reactor/gen set ( Coates Assembled Components ). On the
basis of a verbal agreement, WTF is currently building additional components based on technology already developed that will enable
the hydrogen reactor to adequately power larger commercial and industrial engines. Upon completion of the WTF deliverable, the
parties intend to enter into a formal agreement and the WTF technology will be integrated with the Coates Assembled Components
resulting in a CSRV    hydrogen powered Gen Set.  

If
successful, the hydrogen reactor technology will only require an available supply of water and would be suitable for stationary
engines and generators. Conventional internal combustion engines employing poppet valve assemblies require lubrication and would
experience excessive heat and friction if powered with Hydroxy-Gas. This, in turn, would cause the conventional engines to burn
out in a rather short period of time. The materials and components in the more advanced design of the CSRV    engines
do not require such lubrication, enabling them to operate relatively trouble-free on Hydroxy-Gas as the engine fuel. There can
be no assurance that this technology can be developed successfully, or that if developed, it will be feasible to penetrate the
internal combustion engine market with this technology. A number of new related patent applications are in process to protect
this intellectual property. Although at this time, no arrangements have been made between the Company and George J. Coates, owner
of the technology, regarding licensing of the hydrogen reactor, Mr. Coates has provided his commitment to license this technology
to the Company once the related patent protection is in place. Accordingly, the Company does not currently have any rights to
manufacture, use, sell and distribute the hydrogen reactor technology, should it become commercially feasible to manufacture and
distribute products powered by the Hydroxy-Gas fuel. The Company has been and continues to be responsible for all costs incurred
related to the development of this technology.  

Plan
of Operation   

Manufacturing,
Sales and Distribution   

As
discussed above, we are using the recently completed CSRV    system technology, retrofitted Cummins-based engine
generator in our efforts to attract new licensing transactions and other manufacturing activities. We will also need to
raise sufficient new working capital to ramp-up our own manufacturing and distribution operations.  

We
intend to take advantage of the fact that essentially all the parts and components of the CSRV    generator engine
may be readily sourced and acquired from U.S. based suppliers and subcontractors, and, accordingly, expect to manufacture Gen
Sets by developing assembly lines within owned manufacturing facilities. The initial limited production will enable us to prove
our concept for the CSRV    system technology and we expect this will dovetail with the existing substantial demand
in the marketplace. We plan to address this demand by establishing large scale manufacturing operations in the United States.
Transitioning to large scale manufacturing is expected to require a substantial increase in our work force, securing additional
manufacturing capacity and substantial capital expenditures.  

Our
ability to establish such manufacturing operations, recruit plant workers, finance initial manufacturing inventories and fund
capital expenditures is highly dependent on our ability to successfully raise substantial new working capital in an amount and
at a pace which matches our business plans. Potential sources of such new working capital include (i) sales of our common stock
under our equity purchase agreement with Southridge, (ii) issuance of promissory notes to related parties, (iii) pursuing and
entering into additional sublicensing agreements with OEM s and/or distributors, and (iv) positive working capital generated
from sales of our CSRV    products to other customers once we raise sufficient new working capital and commence production.
Although we have been successful in raising sufficient working capital to continue our ongoing operations, we have encountered
very challenging credit and equity investment markets, and have not been able to raise sufficient new working capital to enable
us to commence production of our Gen Sets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising adequate new working
capital or even any new working capital to carry out our business plans. The current economic environment, which is characterized
by tight credit markets, investor uncertainty about how to safely invest funds and low investor confidence, has introduced additional
risk and difficulty to our challenge to secure such additional working capital.  

Sublicensing   

We
plan to sublicense the CSRV    system technology to multiple OEM s in order to take advantage of third party
manufacturers  existing production capacity and resources by signing OEM agreements.   

In
February 2015, we granted a non-exclusive distribution sublicense to Renown Power Development, Ltd., a China-based sales and distribution
company ( Renown ) covering the territory defined as the Western Hemisphere. Under this sublicense, Renown will be
permitted to sell, lease and distribute CSRV    products. This sublicense provides for payment of licensing fees
amounting to $100 million. We received an initial non-refundable deposit of $500,000 to date. In addition, after Renown receives
aggregate cash flow of $10,000,000, it is required to pay us 25% of all funds it receives from any and all sources until the entire
$100 million licensing fee is paid in full. In the event that Renown completes one or more capital raises aggregating $300 million
or more, the remaining unpaid balance of the $100 million licensing fee shall become immediately due and payable.  

As
collateral for payment of the sublicensing fee, Coates Power, Ltd. an independent China-based manufacturing company that will
produce CSRV    products in China ( Coates Power ) and Renown are to place shares of their capital stock
representing a 25% ownership interest into an escrow account for the benefit of Coates International, Ltd. These shares of stock
will be released from escrow and revert back to Coates Power and Renown only after the $100 million sublicensing fee is paid in
full. We do not have an ownership interest in Coates Power or Renown. Coates Power and Renown are controlled and managed by Mr.
James Pang, our liaison agent in China.  

Coates
Power has agreed to initially source two completed Gen Sets from us. We received a deposit for these two Gen Sets of approximately
$131,000.  

Significant
Estimates   

The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP )
requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. These significant estimates include determining the fair value of convertible promissory notes containing
embedded derivatives as a result of variable conversion rate provisions, determining a value for Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued in connection with anti-dilution provisions in place, assigning useful lives to our
property, plant and equipment, determining an appropriate amount to reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory, providing
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assigning expected lives to and estimating the rate of forfeitures of stock options
granted and selecting a volatility factor in order to estimate the fair value of the Company s
stock options on the date of grant. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Our
principal business activities and efforts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were devoted to (i) undertaking
efforts to raise additional working capital in order to fund ongoing operations in 2016 and (ii) commencing production of a limited
number of CSRV    Industrial Generator Sets in the United States during 2015, including procurement of parts.  

Although
we incurred substantial net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of ($4,439,370) and ($2,444,218), respectively,
it is important to consider that a substantial portion of these losses resulted from non-cash expenses required to be recorded
for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. These net losses should be considered in view of the fact that actual
cash used by operating activities amounting to ($143,262) and ($377,234) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, was significantly less than these reported net losses.  

Revenue   

There
were no sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Sublicensing
fee revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $4,800 and $4,800, respectively. Sublicensing fees
are being recognized by amortizing the license deposit of $300,000 on the Canadian License over the approximate remaining life
of the last CSRV    technology patent in force.  

Expenses   

Research
and Development Expenses   

There
were minimal research and development activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Research and development activities
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily related to continuing refinement of production parts and components
for CSRV  industrial Gen Sets and, to a lesser extent, the hydrogen reactor project. Research and development expenses decreased
by $91,948 to $1,250 in 2016 from $93,198 in 2015.  

Compensation
and Benefits   

Compensation
and benefits increased by $2,721,364 to $4,212,206 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,490,842 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation of $2,631,397.
Stock-based compensation arose from issuances of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to George J. Coates, Gregory G. Coates and
Barry C. Kaye, for anti-dilution.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses decreased by ($69,583) to $109,842 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$179,425 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This net decrease in 2016 resulted from decreases in financing costs
of ($12,120), legal and professional fees of ($11,854), non-capitalizable equipment of ($11,844) building expenses of
($10,185), marketing costs of ($7,500), state sales and other taxes of ($7,251), utilities of ($3,639), office expenses of
($1,902), property taxes of ($1,839) and all other expenses, net of ($1,449).  

Depreciation
and Amortization

and amortization expense decreased to $12,249 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $12,619 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Loss
from Operations   

A
loss from operations of ($4,330,747) was incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with a loss from operations
of ($1,771,284) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the amount of the loss from operations was primarily
attributable to the increase in non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of ($2,631,397), as discussed above.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

Increase
(decrease) in Estimated Fair Value of Embedded Liabilities   

The
estimated fair value of embedded liabilities, which relates to outstanding convertible promissory notes, is remeasured at each
balance sheet date. For the three months ended September  30, 2016 and 2015, other income (expense) was recorded to reflect the
decrease (increase) in the fair value of embedded liabilities of $56,950 and ($467,639), respectively.  

Loss
on conversion of convertible notes   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company realized a loss on conversion of convertible notes of ($54,932)
and ($18,257), respectively.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense decreased to ($110,641) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from ($187,038) in 2015. Interest expense in 2016
consisted of non-cash interest related to convertible promissory notes of $29,962, interest on promissory notes and deferred compensation
to related parties of $51,351, mortgage loan interest of $25,983 and net other interest of $3,345.  

Interest
expense in 2015 consisted of non-cash interest related to convertible promissory notes of $131,519, interest on promissory notes
to related parties of $17,032, mortgage loan interest of $28,547, interest expense related to the sale/leaseback of equipment
of $7,466 and net other interest of $2,474.  

Deferred
Taxes   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the change in deferred taxes was fully offset by a valuation allowance, resulting
in a $-0- net income tax provision.  

Net
Loss   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of ($4,439,370) or ($0.00) per share, as
compared with net loss of ($2,444,218) or ($0.00) per share for three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the amount
of the net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of ($2,631,397), partially
offset by the change in the increase (decrease) in estimated fair value of embedded liabilities of $524,589, as discussed above. 

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Our
principal business activities and efforts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were devoted to (i) completing
work on a new natural gas powered industrial electric, 14.0-liter engine generator, in 2016, by substantially retrofitting a new
generator from Cummins Power Systems to incorporate our CSRV    system technology, including procurement of parts,
along with a number of engineering design changes, (ii) undertaking efforts to raise additional working capital in order to fund
ongoing operations and (iii) research and development of the CSRV    system technology and the hydrogen reactor technology.  

Although
we incurred substantial net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of ($7,851,365) and ($9,283,122), respectively,
it is important to consider that a substantial portion of these losses resulted from non-cash expenses required to be recorded
for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. These net losses should be considered in view of the fact that actual
cash used by operating activities amounting to ($449,121) and ($806,599) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, was significantly less than these reported net losses.  

Revenue   

There
were no sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Sublicensing
fee revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $14,400 and $14,400, respectively. Sublicensing
fees are being recognized by amortizing the license deposit of $300,000 on the Canadian License over the approximate remaining
life of the last CSRV    technology patent in force.

from $282,942 in 2015. This decrease resulted because there were only limited research and development activities in the third
quarter of 2016. 

Compensation
and Benefits   

Compensation
and benefits decreased by ($206,675) to $7,070,179 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $7,276,854 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation of ($294,705). Stock-based
compensation arose from issuances of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to George J. Coates, Gregory G. Coates and Barry C.
Kaye, for anti-dilution.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses decreased by ($123,324) to $333,397 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $456,721 for

months ended  September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $6,939,655 and $8,203,376, respectively, of non-cash expenses, net of non-cash
revenues.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our
cash position at September 30, 2016 was $11,411, a decrease of ($17,796) from the cash position of $29,207 at December 31, 2015.
We had negative working capital of ($4,905,447) at September 30, 2016 which represents an improvement in our working capital of
$570,511 compared to the ($5,475,958) of negative working capital at December 31, 2015. Our current liabilities of $5,169,536
at September 30, 2016, decreased by $562,764 from $5,732,300 at December 31, 2015. This net decrease primarily resulted from (i)
a $474,731 net decrease in the derivative liability related to convertible promissory notes, (ii) a $346,279 decrease in the carrying
amount of convertible notes, net of unamortized discount, (iii) repayment of the $19,349 current portion of a finance lease obligation
and (iv) a $9,400 net decrease in promissory notes to related parties, partially offset by (v) a $232,958 increase in deferred
compensation payable and (vi) a $54,037 increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  

Operating
activities utilized cash of ($449,121) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an improvement of ($357,478) from
the cash utilized for operating activities of ($806,599) for the nine  months ended September 30, 2015. Cash utilized by
operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from (i) a cash basis net loss of
($911,709), after adding back (deducting) non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $6,768,560, interest accrued, but not
paid of $506,042, a non-cash decrease in embedded derivative liabilities related to convertible notes of ($474,731), a
non-cash loss on conversion of convertible notes of $124,962 depreciation and amortization of $36,122, non-cash licensing
revenues and other income of ($26,743) and non-cash portion of research and development expenses of $5,443 and (ii) changes
in current assets and liabilities, including an increase in inventory of ($28,528), a decrease in deferred offering costs and
other assets of $2,985, an increase of $255,173 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in deferred
compensation payable of $232,958.  

Cash
used in investing activities of $11,493 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisted of outlays for furniture.  

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, amounted to $442,818. This was comprised of proceeds
from issuances of promissory notes to related parties of $162,443, issuances of convertible promissory notes aggregating $154,000,
issuances of common stock under an equity purchase agreement of $150,000 and proceeds from issuances of common stock and warrants
amounting to $45,000, partially offset by principal repayments of ($45,000) on a mortgage loan payable, repayments of promissory
notes held by related parties of ($15,000) and finance lease obligation payments amounting to ($8,625).  

Going
Concern   

We
have incurred net recurring losses since inception, amounting to ($64,822,362) as of September 30, 2016 and had a stockholders 
deficiency of ($4,693,771). We will need to obtain additional working capital in order to continue to cover our ongoing cash expenses.  

These
factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the current economic environment,
which is characterized by tight credit markets, investor uncertainty about how to safely invest funds and low investor confidence,
has introduced additional risk and difficulty to our challenge to secure needed additional working capital. Our predecessor Independent
Registered Public Accountants have stated in their Auditor s Report dated April 14, 2016, with respect to our financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern.  

During
2016, we restricted variable costs to only those expenses that are necessary to perform activities related to efforts to
negotiate sublicenses for distribution of our CSRV    products, raising working capital to enable us to commence
limited production of our CSRV    system technology products, research and development and general administrative
costs in support of such activities.   

Our
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Sources
of working capital and new funding being pursued by us include (i) sales of common stock and warrants, (ii) issuances of promissory
notes and convertible promissory notes, (iii) proceeds from sales of CSRV    Gen Sets, (iv) new equity investment,
(v) new borrowing arrangements and (vi) up front licensing fees from prospective new sublicensees. There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in securing any of these sources of additional funding. In this event, we may be required to substantially
or completely curtail our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.  

At
September 30, 2016, current liabilities amounted to $5,169,536, comprised of promissory notes due to related parties aggregating
$1,446,482, legal and professional fees of $1,445,834, deferred compensation of $1,155,102, accrued general and administrative
expenses of $350,107, accrued interest expense of $165,805, a derivative liability related to convertible promissory notes of
$158,196, deposits of $150,595, accrued research and development expenses of $114,859, convertible promissory notes, net of unamortized
discount of $61,831, the current portion of license deposits of $60,725 and the current portion of a mortgage loan amounting to
$60,000.

2015 which are contained in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The significant accounting policies that are
most critical and aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results include the following:  

The
Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These principals require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that
these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board of Directors; however, actual results could differ from
those estimates.  

Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are
recognized based on the fair value of the asset.  The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows,
market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required.  If the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between
the carrying amount and fair value of the asset.  When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value
using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets. We
did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.  

Other
significant estimates include determining the fair value of convertible promissory notes containing embedded derivatives and variable
conversion rates, determining a value for Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued, assigning
useful lives to the Company s property, plant and equipment, determining an appropriate amount to reserve for obsolete and
slow moving inventory, estimating a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assigning expected lives to, and estimating the
rate of forfeitures of, stock options granted and selecting a trading price volatility factor for the Company s common stock
in order to estimate the fair value of the Company s stock options on the date of grant or other appropriate measurement
date. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

Revenue
Recognition   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting
standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity
expects to be entitled to when products are transferred to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09
for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard
in either its first quarter of 2018 or 2019.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10 ), which amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance
obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-10 with ASU 2014-09. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard, as amended, but does not expect it to have
a material impact on its financial statements.  

Stock
Compensation   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ( ASU 2016-09 ),
which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification
of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its
first quarter of 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new stock compensation standard, but does
not expect it to have a material impact on its financial statements.  

Financial
Instruments   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10) ( ASU 2016-01 ),
which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will
be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of the new financial
instruments standard will have a material impact on its financial statements.  

Inventory
Measurement   

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) .
This update requires that inventory value be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
Currently, generally accepted accounting principles require that inventory be valued at the lower of cost or market price to replace
the inventory. This update is to become effective for annual and interim financial statements for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. This update is required to be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this update; however, at this time it does not expect it will have a material impact on its financial statements.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

We
are not required to provide the information under this item as we are a smaller reporting company.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls   

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation, with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO )
(our principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO
and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings    

We
are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board,
government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company
or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our company's
or our company's subsidiaries' officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material
adverse effect.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors   

We
believe there are no changes that constitute material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed April 14, 2016.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

The
following issuances of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were exempt from registration pursuant to Section
4(2), and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. We made this determination based on the representations of the Investors
which included, in pertinent part, that such Investors were  accredited investors  within the meaning of Rule 501
of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, and that such Investors were acquiring our common stock for investment purposes
for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof, and
that the Investors understood that the shares of our common stock may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration
under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption therefrom.   

In
a series of transactions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued $165,000 of convertible promissory notes
to various accredited investors and, after transaction costs, received net proceeds of $154,000. The nominal interest rate on
these notes ranged from 9.75% to 10%. These notes are generally convertible into unregistered shares of our common stock at any
time beginning six months after issuance, with the exception of $25,000 principal amount which qualified for immediate conversion
on the date of issuance. These convertible notes provide for conversion rates at discounts from the trading price of our common
stock over a defined number of trading days leading up to the date of conversion (the  Market Price ). The discounts
ranged from 30% to 38% of the Market Price.  

In
a series of transactions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an aggregate of $664,546 principal amount of convertible
promissory notes, including accrued interest was converted by the holders into 1,209,182,017 unregistered shares of our common
stock.  

In
a series of transactions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made private sales, pursuant to stock purchase agreements
of 55,000,000 unregistered shares of our common stock and 55,000,000 common stock warrants to purchase one unregistered share
of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share, in consideration for $45,000.  

In
a series of transactions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $471,594 principal amount of promissory notes due to
George J. Coates, including accrued interest, were converted into 570,456,147 unregistered, restricted shares of our common stock
at conversion rates ranging from $0.0006 to $0.0011 per share, which was the closing trading price of the stock on the respective
dates of conversion.  

Net
proceeds from the above transactions were used for general working capital purposes.

CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE NOTE  

  DUE
SEPTEMBER 28, 2017  

FOR
VALUE RECEIVED, Coates International, Ltd. (the  Company ) promises to pay to the order of APG CAPITAL HOLDINGS, LLC
and its authorized successors and Permitted Assigns, defined below, (  Holder  ), the aggregate principal face
amount of Thirty Three Thousand Dollars exactly (U.S. $33,000.00) on September 28, 2017 (  Maturity Date  ) and
to pay interest on the principal amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 10% per annum commencing on September 28, 2016. The
interest will be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration
and transfers of this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 300 Cadman Plaza West, 12th Floor, Brooklyn,
NY 11201, initially, and if changed, last appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof
from time to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and the outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the
Maturity Date, less any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer
addressed to such Holder at the last address appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer
shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this
Note to the extent of the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined
below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein. Permitted Assigns means any Holder assignment, transfer or sale of all or a portion
of this Note accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel as provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement.  

This
Note is subject to the following additional provisions:  

1.         This
Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder
shall pay any tax or other governmental charges payable in connection therewith. To the extent that Holder subsequently transfers,
assigns, sells or exchanges any of the multiple lesser denomination notes, Holder acknowledges that it will provide the Company
with Opinions of Counsel as provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement.  

2.         The
Company shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws.  

3.         This
Note may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (  Act  ),
applicable state securities laws and Sections 2(f) and 5(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. Any attempted transfer to a
non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company
and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's records as the owner
hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected
or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section
4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prequalified prospective transferee of this Note,
also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (  Notice of Conversion  )
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion
shall be the Conversion Date. All notices of conversion will be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.  

4.        (a)      The
Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option, at any time commencing six months after the date of funding to the Company by
the Holder, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's
common stock (the   Common Stock  ) at a price (  Conversion Price  ) for each share of Common Stock
equal to  62%  of the   lowest trading price   of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau
OTC Market exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the
future (  Exchange  ), for the    twenty-five    prior trading days including the day upon which
a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered together with an Opinion of
Counsel, by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time
if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the
Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock
to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued, but unpaid interest shall
be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the
number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s
Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders
to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending
this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the conversion price shall be
decreased to 52% instead of 62% while that  Chill  is in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect
a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its
affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company.  

(b)       Interest
on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 10% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company
in Common Stock ( Interest Shares ). Holder may, at any time commencing six months after the date of funding to the
Company by the Holder, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in Section
4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the
unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice.  

(c)       During
the first 180 days this Note is in effect, the Company may redeem this Note by paying to the Holder an amount equal to 150% of
the face amount plus any accrued interest. This Note may not be prepaid after the 180 th  day anniversary. The redemption
must be closed and paid for within 3 business days of the Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid
and the Company may not redeem this Note.  

(d)
     Upon (i) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization (excluding an increase in
authorized capital) or other change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock
split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the
Company is not the surviving entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of incorporation
of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares
of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a  Sale Event ), then, in each case, the Company
shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest
through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount of this
Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event
at the Conversion Price.  

(e)
      In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s
assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made
so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into
the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification,
capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could
have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to
such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received by the
holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor
person or entity acting in good faith.  

5.         No
provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal
of, and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.  

6.         The
Company hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice
of dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for
hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto.  

7.         The
Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the
Holder in collecting any amount due under this Note.  

8.         If
one or more of the following described  Events of Default  shall occur:  

(a)       The
Company shall default in the payment of principal or interest on this Note or any other note issued to the Holder by the Company;
or  

(b)       Any
of the representations or warranties made by the Company herein or in any certificate or financial or other written statements
heretofore or hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Note, or
the Securities Purchase Agreement under which this note was issued shall be false or misleading in any respect; or  

(c)       The
Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any covenant, term, provision, condition, agreement or obligation of
the Company under this Note or any other note issued to the Holder; or  

(d)       The
Company shall (1) become insolvent (which does not include a  going concern opinion); (2) admit in writing its inability
to pay its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commence proceedings for its
dissolution; (4) apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee, liquidator or receiver for its or for a substantial part
of its property or business; (5) file a petition for bankruptcy relief, consent to the filing of such petition or have filed against
it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all under federal or state laws as applicable; or  

(e)       A
trustee, liquidator or receiver shall be appointed for the Company or for a substantial part of its property or business without
its consent and shall not be discharged within sixty (60) days after such appointment; or  

(f)       Any
governmental agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the instance of any governmental agency shall assume custody or
control of the whole or any substantial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or  

(g)       One
or more money judgments, writs or warrants of attachment, or similar process, in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
in the aggregate, shall be entered or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets and shall remain unpaid,
unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of
any proposed sale thereunder; or  

(h)       Defaulted
on or breached any term of any other note of similar debt instrument into which the Company has entered and failed to cure such
default within the appropriate grace period; or  

(i)        The
Company shall have its Common Stock delisted from an exchange (including the OTC Markets exchange) or, if the Common Stock trades
on an exchange, then trading in the Common Stock shall be suspended for more than 10 consecutive days or ceases to file its 1934
act reports with the SEC;  

(j)        Intentionally
Deleted;  

(k)       The
Company shall not deliver to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4 herein without restrictive legend within 3 business
days of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion which includes an Opinion of Counsel expressing an opinion which supports the removal
of a restrictive legend; or  

(l)
       The Company shall not replenish the reserve set forth in Section 12, within 3 business
days of the request of the Holder.  

(m)       The
Company shall be delinquent in its periodic report filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; or  

(n)
     The Company shall cause to lose the  bid  price for its stock in a market (including
the OTC marketplace or other exchange).  

Then,
or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days, and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have
been waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default) at the option
of the Holder and in the Holder's sole discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived,
anything herein or in any note or other instruments contained to the contrary notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately,
and without expiration of any period of grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's rights and remedies provided herein or any
other rights or remedies afforded by law. Upon an Event of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per
annum or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the highest rate of interest permitted by law. In
the event of a breach of Section 8(k) the penalty shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on the 4 th 
day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company. This penalty shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th
 day. The penalty for a breach of Section 8(n) shall be an increase of the outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case
of a breach of Section 8(i), the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 50%. If this Note is not paid at
maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%. Further, if a breach of Section 8(m) occurs or
is continuing after the 6 month anniversary of the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to use the lowest closing bid price
during the delinquency period as a base price for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency
period is $0.01 per share and the conversion discount is 50% the Holder may elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per
share.  

If
the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging
an attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys 
fees and other costs and expenses incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding.  

Make-Whole
for Failure to Deliver Loss. At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the
conversion shares by the by the 3rd business day following the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder
incurs a Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable
to the Holder in respect of the Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows:  

Failure
to Deliver Loss = [(High trade price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion shares)]  

The
Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day
from the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  

9.         In
case any provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent
possible, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.  

10.       Neither
this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by the
Company and the Holder.  

11.       The
Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and that if it previously has been a  shell  issuer
that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported Form 10 type information indicating it is no longer a  shell

state securities laws or to comply with the terms and conditions of any exemption thereunder (in each case). Notwithstanding the

NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE,
SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE
FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING

registration statement filed under the 1933 Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 or Regulation S without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, and (b) such holder provides the Company
with an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect
that a public sale or transfer of such Security may be made without registration under the 1933 Act, and that legend removal is
appropriate, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected. The Buyer agrees to sell
all Securities, including those represented by a certificate(s) from which the legend has been removed, in compliance with applicable
prospectus delivery requirements, if any. In the event that the Company does not accept the opinion of counsel provided by the
Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 or Regulation S,

effect. The Company and its subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise to any of the foregoing.

approval provision applicable to the Company or its securities.
