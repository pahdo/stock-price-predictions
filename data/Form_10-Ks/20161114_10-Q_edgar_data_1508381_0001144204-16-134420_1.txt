1.    NATURE OF
                                         OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN  

The Company and its Operations  

Bionik Laboratories Corp. (formerly Drywave
Technologies Inc., the  Company  or  Bionik ) was incorporated on January 8, 2010 in the State of Colorado
as Strategic Dental Management Corp. On July 16, 2013, the Company changed its name to Drywave Technologies Inc. ( Drywave )
and its state of incorporation from Colorado to Delaware. Effective February 13, 2015, the Company changed its name to Bionik
Laboratories Corp. and reduced the authorized number of shares of common stock from 200,000,000 to 150,000,000. Concurrently,
the Company implemented a 1-for-0.831105 reverse stock split of the common stock, which had previously been approved on September
24, 2014. 

On February 26, 2015, the Company entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement and related transactions whereby it acquired Bionik Laboratories Inc., a Canadian Corporation
( Bionik Canada ) and Bionik Canada issued 50,000,000 Exchangeable Shares, representing a 3.14 exchange ratio, for
100% of the then outstanding common shares of Bionik Canada (the  Merger ). The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable
at the option of the holder, each into one share of the common stock of the Company. In addition the Company issued one Special
Preferred Voting Share (the  Special Preferred Share ) (Note 9). 

As a result of the shareholders of Bionik
Canada having a controlling interest in the Company subsequent to the Merger, for accounting purposes the Merger does not constitute
a business combination. The transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of the Company with Bionik Canada being the
accounting acquirer even though the legal acquirer is Bionik, accordingly, the historic financial statements of Bionik Canada
are presented as the comparative balances for the period prior to the Merger. 

References to the Company refer to the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Bionik Acquisition Inc., Bionik, Inc. (the former IMT) and Bionik Canada. References
to Drywave relate to the Company prior to the Merger. 

On April 21, 2016, the Company acquired
all of the outstanding shares and, accordingly, all assets and liabilities of Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc. (IMT), a Boston,
Massachusetts-based global pioneer and leader in providing effective robotic products for neurorehabilitation, pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) dated March 1, 2016, with IMT, Hermano Igo Krebs, and Bionik
Mergerco Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (Bionik Mergerco). The merger agreement provided for
the merger of Bionik Mergerco with and into IMT, with IMT surviving the merger as the Company s wholly owned subsidiary.
In return for acquiring IMT, IMT shareholders received an aggregate of 23,650,000 shares of the Company s
common stock. 

The Company is a global pioneering robotics
company focused on providing rehabilitation solutions to individuals with neurological disorders, specializing in designing, developing
and commercializing cost-effective physical rehabilitation technologies, prosthetics, and assisted robotic products. The Company
strives to innovate and build devices that can rehabilitate and improve an individual s health, comfort, accessibility and
quality of life through the use of advanced algorithms and sensing technologies that anticipate a user s every move. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements consolidate the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries Bionik Canada, Bionik Acquisition Inc. and Bionik,
Inc. (the former IMT) since its acquisition on April 21, 2016. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ),
which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. 

The Company s principal offices
are located at 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2C9 and Bionik, Inc. s address is 80 Coolidge Hill Road,
Watertown, MA. USA 02472. 

BIONIK LABORATORIES CORP. 

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  For the six month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

  (unaudited) (Amounts expressed in U.S.
Dollars)  

1.    NATURE OF
                                         OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN (continued)  

Going Concern  

As at September 30,
2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,784,377 (working capital as at March 31, 2016, of $187,156) and an accumulated
deficit of $13,245,206 (March 31, 2016 - $11,651,980) and the Company incurred a net loss and comprehensive loss of $1,593,226
for the six-month period ended September 30, 2016 (September 30, 2015   net income of $827,503).  

There is no
certainty that the Company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining
profitable operations in the future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going
concern. The Company will require additional financing this year to fund its operations and it is currently working on
securing this funding through corporate collaborations, public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Sales of
additional equity securities by the Company would result in the dilution of the interests of existing stockholders. There can
be no assurance that financing will be available when required. In the event that the necessary additional financing is not
obtained, the Company would reduce its discretionary overhead costs substantially, or otherwise curtail operations. 

The Company expects the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next
12 months; however, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability
and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The unaudited condensed
interim financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of the recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern. All adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, considered necessary for fair presentation have been
included in these financial statements.

                                         ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements  

These unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements and should be read
in conjunction with those annual audited financial statements filed on Form 10-KT for the period ended March 31, 2016. In the
opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect adjustments, necessary to present
fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations
for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period. 

Newly Adopted and Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities
to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance.
The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting ASU
2014-09 will be assessed by management. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued a new
financial accounting standard on going concern, ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern
(Sub-Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The standard
provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about the organization s
ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this Update apply to all companies. They become effective in the annual
period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of
adopting ASU 2014-15 will be assessed by management. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-16,  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  which illustrates certain guidance governing
adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Such adjustments
are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known,
would have affected the measurement amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the recognition of additional assets
and liabilities. ASU No. 2015-16 eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments. ASU No. 2015-16 is
effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2016. The Company has adopted this ASU No. 2015-16 as at and for the
three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 2016. There was no material effect on the consolidated financial position or the
consolidated results of operations and comprehensive loss. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets
be classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent based on an analysis of each taxpaying component within a jurisdiction.
ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2017. The Company does not anticipate that the
adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or the consolidated results of
operations. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets
and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require additional disclosure
about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASI 2016-02
will have on the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations. 

In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transaction are simplified, including (a) income tax consequences;
(b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments
are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company
is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASI 2016-09 will have on the consolidated financial position and the consolidated
results of operations. 

In August 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . This ASU
provides eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after November 1, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that
the adoption of ASI 2016-15 will have on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  For the six month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015   

  (unaudited) (Amounts expressed in U.S.
Dollars)  

2.    SIGNIFICANT
                                         ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Inventories  

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on the first-in first-out
basis. Work in progress and finished goods consist of materials, labor and allocated overhead. 

Revenue Recognition  

The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an agreement with customer exists, products are shipped
or title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the amount due from the customer is fixed or determinable, collectability
is reasonably assured, and there are no significant future performance obligation. Deposits are carried as liabilities until the
requirements for revenue recognition are met. 

Significant Judgments - Warrant Derivative
Liability 

The Company s derivative warrant
instruments are measured at fair value using a simulation model which takes into account, as of the valuation date, factors including
the current exercise price, the expected life of the warrant, the current price of the underlying stock, its expected volatility,
holding cost and the risk- free interest rate for the term of the warrant (Note 11). The warrant derivative liability is revalued
at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized in the condensed consolidated interim statements of operations
and comprehensive loss under the caption  Change in fair value of warrant derivative liability . 

The selection of the appropriate valuation
model and the inputs and assumptions that are required to determine the valuation requires significant judgment and requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of the related liability and reported amounts of the change
in fair value. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. As the
derivative warrant liability is required to be measured at fair value at each reporting date it is reasonably possible that these
estimates and assumptions could change in the near term. 

Warranty Reserve and Deferred Warranty
Revenue  

The Company provides a one-year warranty
as part of its normal sales offering. When products are sold, the Company provides warranty reserves, which, based on the historical
experience of the Company are sufficient to cover warranty claims. Accrued warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities
on the balance sheet and amount to $57,338 at September 30, 2016 (March 31, 2016 - $Nil). The Company also sells extended warranties
for additional periods beyond the standard warranty. Extended warranty revenue is deferred and recognized as revenue over the
extended warranty period. The Company recognized $15,190 and $25,427 of expense related to the change in warranty reserves and
warranty costs incurred and recorded as an expense in cost of goods sold during the three and six-month period ended September
30, 2016 (March 31, 2016 - $Nil). 

Foreign Currency Translation 

On April 1, 2015, Bionik Canada and Bionik
Acquisition Inc. changed its functional currency from the Canadian Dollar to the U.S. Dollar. This reflects the fact that the
majority of the Company s business is influenced by an economic environment denominated in U.S. currency as well the Company
anticipates revenues to be earned in U.S. dollars. The change in accounting treatment was applied prospectively. The functional
currency is separately determined for the Company and each of its subsidiaries, and is used to measure the financial position
and operating results. The functional currency of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded on initial recognition at the exchange rate at the date
of the transaction. After initial recognition, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated
at the end of each reporting period into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Exchange differences are recognized
in profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Included in the ASC Topic 820 framework
is a three level valuation inputs hierarchy with Level 1 being inputs and transactions that can be effectively fully observed
by market participants spanning to Level 3 where estimates are unobservable by market participants outside of the Company and
must be estimated using assumptions developed by the Company. The Company discloses the lowest level input significant to each
category of asset or liability valued within the scope of ASC Topic 820 and the valuation method as exchange, income or use. The
Company uses inputs, which are as observable as possible, and the methods most applicable to the specific situation of each company
or valued item. 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance
sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due from
related parties approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their
expected realization and their current market rates of interest. Per ASC Topic 820 framework these are considered Level 2 inputs
where inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for
similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets
or liabilities. 

As at September 30, 2016, the Company s
warrant derivative liability was measured at fair value at each reporting period using a simulation model based on Level 3 inputs. 

The Company s policy is to recognize
transfers into and out of Level 3 as of the date of the event or change in the circumstances that caused the transfer. There were
no such transfers during the period.

arrangements described in the Merger Agreement, Bionik issued an aggregate of 23,650,000 shares of Company Common Stock in exchange
for all shares of IMT Common Stock and IMT Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to April 21, 2016. All shares have been
issued at September 30, 2016. 

Bionik also assumed each of the 3,895,000
options to acquire IMT Common Stock granted under IMT s equity incentive plan or otherwise issued by IMT. These options
were exchanged for purchase of an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 1,000,000 have an exercise price
of $0.25. 1,000,000 have an exercise price of $0.95 and 1,000,000 have an exercise price of $1.05. Stock compensation expense
on vested options of $2,582,890 was recorded on the options exchanged and this amount is included in the acquisition equation. 

As a result of the
acquisition of IMT, the Company acquired assets including three licensed patents, an MIT License Agreement, three FDA listed products,
an FDA inspected manufacturing facility, extensive clinical and sales data, and international distributors. Due
to the complexities in identifying and valuing the intangible assets acquired, the Company has not yet finalized the purchase
price allocation. At this time the Company is not practicably able to estimate the fair value of each identifiable asset. The
Company has retained an independent valuator to determine the purchase price allocation. At this time the Company anticipates
the intangible assets to consist of clinical data, sales data, license and patents/technology acquired and any excess to result
in goodwill. 

The following sets forth the preliminary
purchase price allocation based on management s best estimates of fair value, including a summary of major classes of consideration
transferred and the recognized amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. 

(a)  The fair value of
                                         common shares is based on $0.98 the closing market price of the Company s common
                                         stock on April 21, 2016. 

(b)  The fair value of
                                         the vested stock options was determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model
                                         with the following key assumptions: a risk free rate of 1.59%, dividend and forfeiture
                                         rates of 0% and expected volatility of 114% which is consistent with the Company s
                                         assumptions (Note 10).

                                         in a fourth closing (the  Fourth Closing ) of its 2015 private offering.
                                         Each Unit consisted of one common share of the Company, and a warrant to purchase one

                                         in a fifth closing (the  Fifth Closing ) of its 2015 private offering. Each
                                         Unit consisted of one common share of the Company, and a warrant to purchase one common

                                         of 4 years. The warrants were measured at fair value and recorded as a warrant liability
                                         on the consolidated balance sheet (Note 11). The fair value of the warrants exceeded

                                         for a period of 4 years. The warrants were measured at fair value and recorded as a warrant
                                         liability on the consolidated balance sheet (Note 11). The fair value of the warrants
                                         exceeded the net proceeds received upon closing and as a result $74,625 was recorded
                                         as a loss on initial recognition of the warrants and included in the change in fair value
                                         of warrant derivative liability on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive

                                         of the warrant agreement the value of the warrants on exercise is attributed to the shares
                                         on exercise and the Company has recognized a value of $43,562. 

Special Voting Preferred Share 

 In connection with the Merger (Note 1),
on February 26, 2015, the Company entered into a voting and exchange trust agreement (the  Trust Agreement ). Pursuant
to the Trust Agreement, the Company issued one Special Voting Preferred Share to the Trustee, and the parties created a trust
for the Trustee to hold the Special Voting Preferred Share for the benefit of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares (the  Beneficiaries ).
Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Beneficiaries will have voting rights in the Company equivalent to what they would have had
they received shares of common stock in the same amount as the Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiaries. 

In connection with the Merger and the
Trust Agreement, effective February 20, 2015, the Company filed a certificate of designation of the Special Voting Preferred Share
(the  Special Voting Certificate of Designation ) with the Delaware Secretary of State. Pursuant to the Special Voting
Certificate of Designation, one share of the Company s blank check preferred stock was designated as Special Voting Preferred
Share. The Special Voting Preferred Share entitles the Trustee to exercise the number of votes equal to the number of Exchangeable
Shares outstanding on a one-for-one basis during the term of the Trust Agreement. 

The Special Voting Preferred Share is
not entitled to receive any dividends or to receive any assets of the Company upon liquidation, and is not convertible into common
shares of the Company. 

The voting rights of the Special Voting
Preferred Share will terminate pursuant to and in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Special Voting Preferred Share will
be automatically cancelled at such time as no Exchangeable Shares are held by a Beneficiary.

Common share purchase warrants  

The following is a summary of common share
purchase warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2016: 

The weighted-average remaining contractual
term of the outstanding warrants is 2.50 (March 31, 2016 - 2.77). 

Exchangeable share purchase warrants 

In 2014, the Company repaid loans of $180,940
plus accrued interest of $12,138 owing to investors introduced by Pope and Co. As part of this transaction the Company was committed
to issue these lenders warrants exercisable into 349,522 Exchangeable Shares at an exercise price of $0.23 per share for a period
ending March 21, 2017. During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company issued these warrants. 

Warrant derivative liability  

The Company s outstanding common
share purchase warrants include price protection provisions that allow for a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants in
the event the Company subsequently issues common stock or options, rights, warrants or securities convertible or exchangeable
for shares of common stock at a price lower than the exercise price of the warrants. Simultaneously with any reduction to the
exercise price, the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased upon exercise of each of these warrants shall be increased
based on a pre-defined formula. 

In addition, prior to the effectiveness
of certain resale registration statements or if any such registration statements are no longer effective, the holder of the Company s
warrants, at their option, may exercise all or any part of the warrants in a  cashless  or  net-issue 
exercise. 

The Company has the option to redeem the
warrants for $0.001 per warrant if the daily volume weighted-average price of the common shares is 200% or more of the exercise
price for twenty consecutive trading days provided there is an effective registration statement covering the common shares available
throughout the thirty day period after the redemption date. The warrant holders then have thirty days to exercise the warrants
or receive the redemption amount. 

The Company s derivative instruments
have been measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting period using a simulation model. The Company recognizes all
of its warrants with price protection on its consolidated balance sheet as a derivative liability.

  (unaudited) (Amounts expressed in U.S.

The following summarizes the changes in
the value of the warrant derivative liability from inception until September 30, 2016: 

During the six month period ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $1,739,047 (September 30, 2015 - $4,413,819) on re-measurement of the warrant liability
to fair value. The change is recorded as a change in fair value of warrant derivative liability within the Company s consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. 

The key inputs and assumptions used in
the simulation model at inception and at September 30, 3016 and March 31, 2016 are as follows:

30, 2016 and 2015  

  (unaudited) (Amounts expressed in U.S.
Dollars)  

In addition to the forgoing, the Company
also utilized a holding cost to approximate the impact of a holder of the warrant to maintain a hedging strategy in which they
maintained a short position. On analysis of comparable companies and other information the Company has determined that the use
of 2.25% in the simulation model is a reasonable assumption. 

The warrant derivative liability is classified
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because on initial recognition and again at each reporting period, it was valued using
these significant inputs and assumptions that are unobservable in the market. Changes in the values assumed and used in the simulation
model can materially affect the estimate of fair value. 

Generally, an increase in the market price
of the Company s common shares, an increase in the volatility of the Company s common shares and an increase in the
expected life would result in a directionally similar change in the estimated fair value of the warrant derivative liability.
An increase in the risk free rate would result in a decrease in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability. 

The expected life is based on the remaining
contractual term of the warrants. The risk free rate was based on U.S. treasury-note yields with terms commensurate with the remaining
term of the warrants. Expected volatility over the expected term of the warrants is estimated based on consideration of historical
volatility and other information. 

In addition to the assumptions above,
the Company also took into consideration the probability of the Company s participation in another round of financing, the
type of such financing and the range of the stock price for the financing at that time. At each increment of the simulation, the
daily volume weighted-average price was calculated. If this amount was 200% greater than the exercise price of the warrants at
the time, and this threshold was maintained for 20 consecutive days, the simulation assumed the trigger of the Company s
option to redeem and the exercise of the warrants by the holder within thirty days. In the circumstance where the redemption was
not triggered the warrant was valued at its discounted intrinsic value at maturity. 

Prior to the acquisition of IMT in April
2012, IMT entered into a Patent License Agreement with an unrelated third party (the  Licensee ). Under the terms
of the perpetual license agreement, the Company will receive royalties from the Licensee based on a licensed product sold by the
Licensee. There was no royalty income during the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 under the terms
of the agreement.

13.  LICENSING AGREEMENTS 

The Company s subsidiary maintains
a licensing agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) for exclusive rights to utilize certain
of MIT s patented technology. The licensing agreement remains in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all patent
rights and patent applications filed that are included under license, the last of which patent rights expires in November 2024.
The agreement provides the Company with the option to sublicense the rights under the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement,
as amended, royalties are payable to MIT based on 3% of certain domestic product sales and 1.5% of certain international product
sales, as defined, and 50% of all sublicense income. 

The Company recognized $nil of royalty
expense under this agreement during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had
accrued royalty and related amounts payable to MIT of $33,369 included in accounts payable on the condensed consolidated interim
balance sheets. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the entire balance owed was paid to MIT. One of the Company s directors
is an employee of MIT as well as the Company s Chief Science Officer. 

The Company maintains a second licensing
agreement with the same director noted above and an unrelated third party for exclusive rights to utilize certain patented technology.
The Company has exclusive rights to the patents and related applications, as defined, until expiration in May 2027. The agreement
provides the Company with the option to sublicense the rights under the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement royalties
are payable to the patent holders based on 1% of net sales, as defined, and 50% of all sublicense income. There have been no sales
under this agreement through September 30, 2016. 

14.    COMMITMENTS
                                         AND CONTINGENCIES  

Contingencies  

From time to time, the Company may be
involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, collection
claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations
and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution
of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations
or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of legal costs, diversion
of management resources and other factors. 

The Company s cash balances are
maintained in two banks in Canada and a Canadian Bank subsidiary in the US and a US Bank. Deposits held in banks in Canada are
insured up to $100,000 CAD per depositor for each bank by The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal crown corporation.
Actual balances at times may exceed these limits. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk is the risk that the
value of a financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in the interest rates. The Company has minimal exposure
to fluctuations in the market interest rate. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the Company manages
exposure through its normal operating and financing activities. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is
the risk that the Company will incur difficulties meeting its financial obligations, as they are due. The Company s approach
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are due within the current operating period. 

The Company has funded its operations
through the issuance of capital stock, convertible debt and loans in addition to grants and investment tax credits received from
the Government of Canada. 

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-looking Statements  

This Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events
that are intended as  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. All statements included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than statements of
historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the
future are forward-looking statements. These statements appear in a number of places, including, but not limited to in this  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  These statements represent our reasonable judgment
of the future based on various factors and using numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially from those contemplated by the
statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and
use words such as  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   forecast, 
 may,   will ,  should,   plan,   project  and other words of similar
meaning. In particular, these include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following: 

projected
                                         operating or financial results, including anticipated cash flows used in operations; 

expectations
                                         regarding capital expenditures; and 

our
                                         beliefs and assumptions relating to our liquidity position, including our ability to
                                         obtain additional financing. 

Any
or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known
or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors including, among others: 

the
                                         loss of key management personnel on whom we depend; 

our
                                         ability to operate our business efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs (including
                                         general and administrative expenses) and obtain financing when required; and 

our
                                         expectations with respect to our acquisition activity. 

In addition, there
may be other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the results referenced in the forward-looking
statements, some of which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in this  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Many of these factors will be important in determining our
actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Our actual future results may vary materially
from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. All forward- looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of
the date they are made, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as otherwise required by applicable law. 

This discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes
and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-KT, for the transition period ended March 31, 2016 as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. 

The discussion and
analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions. The estimates were based
on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely
to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, but we do not believe such differences will materially
affect our financial position or results of operations. Bionik, Inc. s (IMT) operations are included since its acquisition
on April 21, 2016 to September 30, 2016. 

Nature of Company  

We are a global
pioneering robotics company focused on providing rehabilitation solutions to individuals with neurological disorders, specializing
in designing, developing and commercializing cost-effective physical rehabilitation technologies, prosthetics, and assisted robotic
products. We strive to innovate and build devices that can rehabilitate and improve an individual s health, comfort, accessibility
and quality of life through the use of advanced algorithms and sensing technologies that anticipate a user s every move. 

Bionik Laboratories
Corp. was incorporated on January 8, 2010 in the State of Colorado. At the time of our incorporation the name of our company was
Strategic Dental Management Corp. On July 16, 2013, we changed our name from Strategic Dental Management Corp. to Drywave Technologies,
Inc. and changed our state of incorporation from Colorado to Delaware. Effective February 13, 2015, we filed with the Secretary
of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation whereby, among other things, we changed our name
to Bionik Laboratories Corp. 

On April 21, 2016,
we acquired all of the outstanding shares and, accordingly, all assets and liabilities of Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc.
(IMT), a Boston, Massachusetts-based global pioneer and leader in providing effective robotic products for neurorehabilitation,
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 1, 2016, with IMT, Hermano Igo Krebs, and Bionik Mergerco Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary. The merger agreement provided for the merger of Bionik Mergerco with and into IMT,
with IMT surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary. In return for acquiring IMT, IMT shareholders received or will receive
up to an aggregate of 23,650,000 shares of our common stock. IMT s legal name has been changed to Bionik, Inc. subsequent
to April 21, 2016. 

Through the acquisition
of IMT, Bionik has added a portfolio of products focused on upper and lower extremity rehabilitation of stroke patients. We now
have three products on the market and four products in varying stages of development that we are currently pursuing. 

The InMotion ARM,
InMotion ARM/HAND, and InMotion Wrist have been characterized as Class II medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
and are listed by the FDA to market and sell in the United States. In addition to these in-market products, the InMotion Anklebot
is in development, and we are also developing the InMotion LIGHT, which is an upper extremity product that allows the patient
to extend their therapy for as long as needed while rehabilitating at home and is being developed on the same design platform
as the InMotion clinical products. All of these products are designed to provide intelligent, patient-adaptive therapy in a manner
that has been clinically verified to maximize neuro-recovery. 

Patented technology
used in the InMotion Wrist is licensed to us from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Dr. Hermano Igo Krebs, our
newly appointed Chief Science Officer, and Neville Hogan, an advisor and former director of IMT, are professors. 

The IMT clinical
products have been sold in over 20 countries, including the United States. IMT has a growing body of clinical data for its products.
In addition, IMT's manufacturing facility is compliant with ISO-13485 and FDA regulations. 

In addition, we
are developing for commercialization the ARKE lower body exoskeleton, as well as a new product candidate for gait assistance for
rehabilitation based on a design being developed by Dr. Krebs, which we expect to further advance in 2017 assuming resources are
available. We plan to develop other biomechatronic solutions through internal research and development and we may further augment
our product portfolio through strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities in the future. 

We also have two
earlier stage development technologies: APOLLO, an intelligent prosthetic knee; and Chronos, a cloud-based intelligent patient
queuing system. We currently do not have the financial capability or personnel to develop APOLLO and Chronos now that our business
model has changed to include the InMotion products   both existing and in development. Accordingly, our investment in APOLLO
and Chronos is on hold. We intend to continue to revisit developing our technologies and the markets for our technologies as we
grow. 

We currently hold
an intellectual property portfolio that includes 5 U.S. and international patents pending, 13 U.S. provisional patents, and other
patents under development. The provisional patents may not be filed as full patents and new provisional patents may be filed as
the technology evolves or changes. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of IMT, we hold exclusive licenses to three additional
patents. 

The Acquisition Transaction  

On February 26, 2015,
we entered into an Investment Agreement with Bionik Acquisition Inc. (the  Investment Agreement ), a company existing
under the laws of Canada, and our wholly owned subsidiary ( Acquireco ), and Bionik Laboratories, Inc. ( Bionik
Canada ), a company incorporated on March 24, 2011 under the Canada Business Corporations Act, whereby we acquired 100 Class
1 common shares of Bionik Canada representing 100% of the outstanding Class 1 common shares of Bionik Canada, taking into account
the Exchangeable Share Transaction (as defined below) (the  Acquisition Transaction ). After giving effect to the
Acquisition Transaction, we commenced operations through Bionik Canada. 

Immediately prior
to the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and the First Closing (as defined below), we transferred all of the business, properties,
assets, operations and goodwill of the Company (other than cash and cash equivalents), and liabilities as of March 6, 2013, to
our then-existing wholly owned subsidiary, Strategic Dental Alliance, Inc., a Colorado corporation ( Strategic Dental Alliance ),
and then transferred all of the capital stock of Strategic Dental Alliance to Brian E. Ray, a former officer and existing director
(through March 20, 2015) and Jon Lundgreen, a former officer and director, pursuant to a Spin- Off Agreement (the  Spin-Off
Agreement ). Also as of immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and the First Closing, we entered
into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Tungsten 74 LLC, pursuant to which Tungsten 74 LLC assumed all of our remaining
liabilities through the closing of the Acquisition Transaction (the  Assignment and Assumption Agreement ). Accordingly,
as of the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and the First Closing, we had no assets or liabilities. 

As a condition of
the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, Bionik Canada created a new class of exchangeable shares (the  Exchangeable
Shares ), which were issued to the existing common shareholders of Bionik Canada in exchange for all of their outstanding
common shares, all of which were cancelled (the  Exchangeable Share Transaction ). 

Pursuant to the rights
and privileges of the Exchangeable Shares, the holders of such Exchangeable Shares maintain the right to (i) receive dividends
equal to, and paid concurrently with, dividends paid by the Company to the holders of Common Stock; (ii) vote, through the Trustee s
voting of the Special Voting Preferred Stock (as defined herein) on all matters that the holders of Common Stock are entitled
to vote upon; and (iii) receive shares of Common Stock upon the liquidation or insolvency of the Company upon the redemption of
such Exchangeable Shares by Acquireco. 

As part of the Exchangeable
Share Transaction, we entered into the following agreements, each dated February 26, 2015: 

Voting
                                         and Exchange Trust Agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) with Bionik Canada and
                                         Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the  Trustee ); and 

Support
                                         Agreement (the  Support Agreement ) with Acquireco and Bionik Canada 

Pursuant to the terms
of the Trust Agreement, the parties created a trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries, which are the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares, enabling the Trustee to exercise the voting rights of such holders until such time as they choose to redeem their Exchangeable
Shares for shares of the Common Stock of the Company, and allowing the Trustee to hold certain exchange rights in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares. 

As a condition of
the Trust Agreement and prior to the execution thereof, we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Delaware Secretary of State,
effective February 20, 2015, designating a class of our preferred shares as The Special Voting Preferred Stock (the  Special
Voting Preferred Stock ) and issued one share of the Special Voting Preferred Stock to the Trustee. 

The Special Voting
Preferred Stock entitles the Trustee to exercise the number of votes equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares outstanding on
a one-for-one basis during the term of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement further sets out the terms and conditions under
which holders of the Exchangeable Shares are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to how to vote during any stockholder meetings
of our company. 

Pursuant to the terms
of the Trust Agreement, we granted the Trustee the right to require our Company to purchase the Exchangeable Shares from any beneficiary
upon the occurrence of certain events including in the event that we are bankrupt, insolvent or our business is wound up. The
Trust Agreement continues to remain in force until the earliest of the following events: (i) no outstanding Exchangeable Shares
are held by any beneficiary under the Trust Agreement; and (ii) each of Bionik Canada and us elects to terminate the Trust Agreement
in writing and the termination is approved by the beneficiaries. 

Pursuant to the terms
of the Support Agreement, we agreed to certain covenants while the Exchangeable Shares were outstanding, including: (i) not to
declare or pay any dividends on our common stock unless simultaneously declaring the equivalent dividend for the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares, (ii) advising Bionik Canada in advance of any dividend declaration by our company, (iii) ensure that the
record date for any dividend or other distribution declared on the shares of the Company is not less than seven days after the
declaration date of such dividend or other distribution; (iv) taking all actions reasonably necessary to enable Bionik Canada
to pay and otherwise perform its obligations with respect to the issued and outstanding Exchangeable Shares, (iv) to ensure that
shares of the Company are delivered to holders of Exchangeable Shares upon exercise of certain redemption rights set out in the
agreement and in the rights and restrictions of the Exchangeable Shares, and (v) reserving for issuance and keeping available
from our authorized common stock such number of shares as may be equal to: (A) the number of Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding
from time to time; and (B) the number of Exchangeable Shares issuable upon the exercise of all rights to acquire Exchangeable
Shares from time to time. 

The Support Agreement
also outlines certain restrictions on our ability to issue any dividends, rights, options or warrants to all or substantially
all of our stockholders during the term of the agreement unless the economic equivalent is provided to the holders of Exchangeable
Shares. The Support Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario. 

Concurrently with
the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and in contemplation of the Acquisition Transaction, we sold 7,735,750 units (the  Units )
for gross proceeds of $6,188,600 (including $500,000 of outstanding bridge loans converted into Units at the offering price) at
a purchase price of $0.80 per Unit (the  Purchase Price ) in a private placement offering (the  Offering ).
Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ) and a four year warrant
(the  Warrant ) to purchase one share of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $1.40 per share (the  Warrant
Shares ). We incurred share issued costs related to this transaction of $848,822. 

The Offering was being
offered with a minimum offering amount of $6,000,000 (the  Minimum Offering Amount ) and up to a maximum offering
amount of $12,800,000 (subject to a $2,600,000 overallotment option). Once the Minimum Offering amount was reached and held in
escrow and other conditions to closing were satisfied (including the simultaneous closing of the Acquisition Transaction), the
Company and the placement agent were able to conduct a first closing (the  First Closing ). As a result of the Offering,
after payment of placement agent fees and expenses but before the payment of other offering expenses such as legal and accounting
expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $5,339,778 at the First Closing, including the $500,000 in bridge loans we
previously received that were taken into account as part of the Minimum Offering Amount. In addition, the placement agent was
granted 10% warrant coverage for all Units sold in the Offering, which are exercisable at $0.80 per share for a period of 4 years. 

As of the Acquisition
Transaction and the First Closing, an aggregate of 90,575,126 shares of our Common Stock were deemed cancelled, of which 90,207,241
were held by the former Chief Executive Officer of Drywave. 

Immediately following
the Acquisition Transaction, the Exchangeable Share Transaction and the First Closing, there were 63,735,813 shares of our common
stock and equivalents issued and outstanding of which 6,000,063 were held by existing stockholders, 7,735,750 were held by the
investors in the Offering and Bionik Canada shareholders held an equivalent of 50,000,000 shares of our common stock through their
ownership of 100% of the Exchangeable Shares. 

From April 21, to
June 30, 2015, we sold to accredited investors 6,568,750 Units for gross proceeds of $5,255,000. After payment of placement agent
fees and expenses but before payment of offering expenses such as legal and accounting we received net proceeds of $4,556,818.
Through the final closing of the Offering on June 30, 2015, we raised in the Offering aggregate gross proceeds of $13,126,600. 

Significant Accounting Policies and
Estimates  

The discussion and
analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the condensed consolidated interim financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial
statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis we review our estimates
and assumptions. The estimates were based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, but we
do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations. 

Results of Operations  

From the inception
of Bionik Canada on March 24, 2011 through to September 30, 2016, we have generated a deficit of $13,245,206. 

The Company expects
to incur additional operating losses during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and beyond, principally as a result of our continuing
research and development, the acquisition of IMT, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs associated
with being a public company. 

Our results of operations
are presented for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 with comparatives for the three and six months ended September
30, 2015. The Company changed its fiscal year to March 31, effective after the Company s previous fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 and accordingly this report relates to the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. 

Three and Six Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Six Months ended September 30, 201   

Sales
and Cost of Sales   

The
Company recorded revenues of $18,283 and $182,474 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $Nil for the
three and six months ended September 30, 2015. The 2015 revenues of IMT were not consolidated in to the prior year s results
as this was prior to the IMT acquisition. IMT revenues were $374,530 and $812,944 for the three and full six months ended September
30, 2015. In 2015, the acquired company was under-funded and had no commercial sales team, which significantly impacted 2016 revenues.
The Company hired a Chief Commercialization Officer in August 2016 to build out the sales and marketing team, and has seen positive
initial results of these efforts which we expect to accelerate as the Company continues to invest in commercialization efforts.
Based on the strong clinical data, new sales and marketing efforts, an expanded product range as well as expanding the Company s
sales efforts geographically, the Company expects revenues to grow significantly from 2016 levels. 

Operating Expenses  

Total operating expenses
for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,807,323 and $3,840,336 compared to $1,182,845 and $3,609,328 for
the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, as further detailed below. 

Research and development
expenses were $813,773 and $1,231,563 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to expenses of $768,301
and $1,378,123 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the six months relates primarily to less
prototyping of products nearing completion of engineering and a decrease due to a senior executive who left the Company, being
partially offset by higher expenses resulting from the IMT acquisition. 

For the three and
six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $577,853 and $1,881,467 compared
to general and administrative expenses of $372,342 and $874,443 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in these expenses is primarily due to legal, accounting, and audit costs related to the IMT acquisition and the change in year-end
from December 31 to March 31, the costs of being a public company and the administration costs of IMT since acquisition on April
21, 2016. 

For the three
and six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $204,842 and $424,090 in share-based compensation expense compared
to $26,724 and $1,324,282 in the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in stock compensation expense relates
to fewer stock options granted by the Company in this period over last year and fewer shares issued to consultants for services
provided. The options previously granted by Bionik prior to the Acquisition Transaction were revalued on its completion and new
options granted and options vesting during the quarter and the year to date resulted in the current expense. 

Other Expenses  

For the three and
six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred interest expenses of $(5,203) and $10,031 compared to interest expenses
of $nil and $nil for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The changes in interest expenses relates to the Company having
more interest bearing debt during the period, and the adjustment of minor over-expense of interest on demand loans whose interest
rate was decreased. 

The Company s
outstanding warrants include price protection provisions that allow for a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants in the
event the Company subsequently issues certain common stock or options, rights, warrants or securities convertible or exchangeable
for shares of common stock at a price lower than the exercise price of the warrants. Simultaneously with any reduction to the
exercise price, the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased upon exercise of each of these warrants shall be increased
based on a pre-defined formula. During the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain of
$2,130,106 and $1,739,047 on re-measurement to fair value at period end September 30, 2016 (gain of $3,496,070 and $4,413,819
for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015) which was recorded within the Company s consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss and represents a non-cash item. 

Other Income  

For the three and
six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had other income of $395,296 and $406,514 compared to other income of $5,533
and $23,012 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is other income in the quarter and six months
ended September 30, 2016 was due to the receipt of the Company s final scientific research credit from the Canadian government
which related to a claim when the Company was a private company, the sale of redundant equipment and interest income. In 2015,
other income was from interest income only. 

Gain and losses included in other comprehensive
income  

Effective April 1, 2015,
the Company changed the functional currency of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Bionik Acquisition Inc. and Bionik Canada from the
Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar. This reflects the fact that the majority of the Company s business is influenced by
an economic environment denominated in U.S. currency, and the Company sells its product and service revenues in U.S. dollars. 

Comprehensive Loss  

Comprehensive
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $729,546 or $0.01 per share and the comprehensive loss for the
six months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,593,226 resulting in a loss per share of $(0.02) compared to comprehensive income of
$2,318,758 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in income per share of $0.03, and for the six months ended
September 30, 2015 income of $827,503 which resulted in income per share of $0.01. 

The comprehensive
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is impacted by change
in fair value of warrant derivative liability resulting in a non-cash gain of $2,130,106 in the three month period ended September
30, 2016 (September 30, 2015 - $3,496,070). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

IMT
generated approximately $2,000,000 of revenue in 2015, however our wholly owned subsidiary since its acquisition on April 21, 2016
has reported revenue of $182,474 for the period of April 21, 2016 to September 30, 2016   we can give no assurance that we
will generate similar or greater revenues in 2016 when compared to 2015 as a result of the InMotion products, and capital sales
to hospitals and clinic sales have a longer sale cycle due to the capital budget approval process. As described earlier we have
significantly increased our commercial strategy and expect that these efforts will result in success in the future. 

We
have funded operations through the issuance of capital stock, loans, grants and investment tax credits received from the Government
of Canada. We raised in our 2015 private offering aggregate gross proceeds of $13,126,600, which resulted in net proceeds after
costs of $11,341,397. At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,677,310. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition
of IMT, the Company indirectly assumed an aggregate of approximately $1.26 million of debts and other liabilities of IMT, based
on the internal, unaudited financial information of IMT. 

There
is no certainty that we will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable
operations in the future to enable us to meet our obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. We
will require additional funds to further develop our expanded business plan, including the anticipated commercialization of the
ARKE, the marketing of our newly-acquired InMotion products and the development of our product pipeline. We will require additional
financing this year to fund our operations and we are currently working on securing this funding through corporate collaborations,
public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Sales of additional equity securities would result in the dilution of the
interests of existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required. In the event that
the necessary additional financing is not obtained, we would reduce our discretionary overhead costs substantially, or otherwise
curtail operations. 

We
expect the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months; however, these
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

We
also need additional funds to respond to business opportunities including potential acquisitions of complementary technologies
or business, protect our intellectual property, develop new lines of business and enhance our operating infrastructure. While we
may need to seek additional funding for any such purposes, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all.
In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may
seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. We may not be able to negotiate any such
arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required
to curtail or terminate some or all of our product lines. 

As
we proceed with the ARKE product development, the marketing of the three commercial products of IMT and the development of other
development-stage products, we have devoted and expect to continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures
and research and development costs and operations, marketing, clinical trials and sales expenditures. 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities   

During the six months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company used cash in operating activities of $3,964,234 compared to $2,484,857 for the six months
ended September 30, 2015. The increased use of cash is mainly attributable to the larger loss in the six months ended September
30, 2016 due to higher general and administrative costs and the costs of becoming a public company and $1,739,047 of change in
the fair value of the warrant derivative liability compared to a $4,409,410 in the six months ended September 30, 2015. The change
in fair value of warrant derivative liability is a non-cash item. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities   

During the six months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $6,848 and for the six months ended September 30, 2015, net
cash used in investing activities of $343,033. The decrease in 2016 is a result of there being no loans made as there was in 2015
and minimal cash additions to equipment. 

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

Net cash provided
by financing activities was $266,635 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities
of $4,552,409 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is due to the Offering in 2015, and no capital has been
raised in 2016; however the balance in 2016 reflects the cash remaining from a $900,000 advance sent to IMT immediately before
the acquisition close of which $266,635 remained on hand on April 21, 2016. 

Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard outlines a single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue
recognition guidance. The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within
those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact on the consolidated financial statements
of adopting ASU 2014-09 will be assessed by management. 

In August 2014, the
FASB issued a new financial accounting standard on going concern, ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements
  Going Concern (Sub-Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. 
The standard provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about
the organization s ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this Update apply to all companies. They become
effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. The impact on the consolidated
financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-15 will be assessed by management. 

In September 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  which illustrates
certain guidance governing adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment
to goodwill. Such adjustments are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the
recognition of additional assets and liabilities. ASU No. 2015-16 eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such
adjustments. ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for the fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2016. The Company has adopted this ASU
No. 2015-16 as at and for the three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 2016. There was no material effect on the consolidated
financial position or the consolidated results of operations and comprehensive loss. 

In November 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent based on an analysis of each taxpaying component
within a jurisdiction. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for the fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2017. The Company does not anticipate
that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or the consolidated results
of operations. 

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the
assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require additional disclosure
about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASI 2016-02
will have on the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transaction are simplified, including (a) income tax consequences;
(b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments
are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company
is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASI 2016-09 will have on the consolidated financial position and the consolidated
results of operations. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . This
ASU provides eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash
flows. ASU 2016=15 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after November 1, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact
that the adoption of ASI 2016-15 will have on the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Management does not
believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect
on the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance
sheet transactions. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Not applicable for
smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures  

During the three and
six months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

We maintain  disclosure
controls and procedures  as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the
period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report were ineffective due to a lack of segregation of duties as well as lack of administrative and financial personnel and related resources.
