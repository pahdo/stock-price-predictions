  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
 (Information as to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is unaudited) 
   
 (1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
   
 Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc., ( the Company,   Successor  or  Global ), was formed on May 11, 2015, under the laws of the State of Florida to reorganize Global Boatworks, LLC. At formation the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Global Boatworks, LLC, ( LLC ) which was formed on June 16, 2014, under the laws of the State of Florida.  The Company s business activities to date have primarily consisted of the formation of a business plan for building luxury floating vessels on a barge bottom and initiating construction. On September 25, 2014, effective the close of business September 24, 2014, the Company acquired a luxury floating vessel from Financial Innovators Corp., ( Predecessor  or  Financial Innovators ), and operates it as a rental property, based in Boston harbor. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the activities of Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc. and Global Boatworks, LLC, its wholly owned subsidiary. 
   
 (2) BASIS OF PRESENTATION, USE OF ESTIMATES AND GOING CONCERN 
   
  a) Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation  
   
 The comparative figures shown throughout these unaudited consolidated financial statements are the historical results of Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc. inclusive of its wholly owned subsidiary Global Boatworks, LLC. The Company has retroactively restated amounts within certain components of Shareholders' Deficit on the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and footnotes to account for the acquisition and reorganization of Global Boatworks, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America ( U.S. ) as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods shown. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The information included in the September 30, 2016 consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations contained elsewhere in this report and the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed in Form 10-K on March 30, 2016 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
  b) Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements involved the valuation of construction in progress, depreciable life of the luxury floating vessel, depreciable life of property and equipment, valuation of long lived assets, valuation of derivatives, the valuation of common and preferred stock issued as compensation, and valuation allowance of deferred income tax benefit.

 (2) BASIS OF PRESENTATION, USE OF ESTIMATES AND GOING CONCERN, continued 
   
  c) Going Concern  
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  The Company s financial position and operating results raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, as reflected by the accumulated deficit and stockholder s deficit of  $855,454 and $475,484 at September 30, 2016. The Company had a net loss of $532,026 and used cash of $246,979 in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company is expected to have increasing expenses as a result of becoming a publicly held company without immediate increases in revenues as they attempt to implement their plan of operations. Additionally, the Company is past due on the $100,000 note that was due July 9, 2016, of which the Company is currently negotiating an extension or modification. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon commencing operations, developing sales and obtaining additional capital and financing. The Company is seeking to raise sufficient equity capital to enable it to build the first two new style luxury floating vessels. It is also considering ways to monetize the value embedded in the luxury floating vessel it currently owns, either through a sale or a loan collateralized by this asset. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company is currently seeking additional capital to allow it to continue its planned operations. 
   
 (3) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   
  a) Cash and cash equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. We had no financial instruments that qualified as cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 (unaudited) or December 31, 2015. 
   
  b) Construction in progress  
   
 Costs to construct vessels are capitalized during the construction phase. Upon completion of a vessel the Company will either sell the vessel or place in it service as a rental property. If the vessel is to be leased the construction costs are transferred to property and equipment and depreciated over its useful life. 
   
  c) Property and equipment  
   
 All property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.  Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. Repairs and maintenance charges, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations as incurred. 
   
  d) Impairment of long-lived assets   
   
 A long-lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from its use and eventual disposition. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived assets exceeds its fair value.

 (3) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued 
   
  e)   Financial instruments and Fair value measurements  
   
 ASC 825-10  Financial Instruments , allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments. 
   
 ASC 825 also requires disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments. The carrying value of the Company s current financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair values because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
   
 FASB ASC 820  Fair Value Measurement  clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. It also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of inputs as follows: 
   
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
   
 Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability. 
   
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
   
 The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
   
 The following is the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2), and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 
   
 Level 3   Embedded Derivative Liability  

Changes in Level 3 assets measured at fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:

  f) Revenue recognition  
   
 Revenue is recognized when earned, generally starting when the rental customer takes temporary possession of the floating vessel and through their contracted stay. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with ASC 605-45. Rental deposits from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the rental period, (generally 7 days or less), once the rental period begins. Cost of Revenue includes the marina dockage fees and fees charged by the web site Homeaway, where the floating vessel is advertised for rent. 
   
  g) Stock compensation for services rendered  
   
 Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the shorter of period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award or the vesting period. The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. 
   
 Pursuant to ASC 505-50, for share-based payments to non-employees, compensation expense is determined at the  measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. 
   
  h) Income Taxes   
   
 The LLC was a pass through entity for income tax purposes, therefore there is no income tax provision or liability for this entity through the Company s incorporation date of May 11, 2015. As a result of the reorganization the Company became a taxable entity on May 11, 2015. Upon becoming a taxable entity, the Company began to use the asset and liability method of ASC 740 to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that, based on available evidence, is more likely than not to be realized. 
   
 The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016 tax years 2014 and 2015 for the LLC and 2015 for the corporation remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit or any notifications from the IRS for any of the open tax years.

  i) Net loss per share  
   
 Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing the loss attributable to stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that shared in the earnings of the Company.  Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the loss available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period and dilutive potential shares outstanding unless consideration of such dilutive potential shares would result in anti-dilution. The shares to be issued under the stock subscription receivable (see Note 8) are considered anti-dilutive. At September 30, 2016, there were 1,532,740 common stock equivalents relating to the $47,668 convertible note that were not included in the computation of diluted shares since they were antidilutive. (See Notes 10 and 13). 
   
  j) Recent accounting pronouncements  
   
 The Company has considered recent accounting pronouncements during the preparation of these unaudited financial statements and does not expect any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on its unaudited financial statements. 
   
 (4) CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS 
   
 Construction in progress represents the capitalized construction of its Luxuria floating vessel(s) being constructed for sale. At September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the Company has capitalized the $2,163 deposit made on the custom trusses to be used in the construction of its first Luxuria floating vessel as well as additional expenses which are directly attributed to the construction. In August 2016, the Company issued 425,000 shares of common stock valued at $70,000 in payment of the construction of the barge bottom for the first Luxuria. The balance of construction in progress is $182,121 at September 30, 2016. (See Notes 6 and 8(c)) 
   
 (5) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
   
 Property and Equipment consists of the following at September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015: 

On September 25, 2014, the Company acquired the Miss Leah, a two story luxury floating vessel in the Cape Cod architectural style built on a barge platform. The Miss Leah is based at a marina in Boston harbor. It is rented out primarily through a third party rental management company on a short term vacation type basis. The Miss Leah was built in 2004 by the founder of the Company and subsequently sold in 2006 to his brother who established the Predecessor s rental business.  Due to the related party relationship between the Company and the Predecessor the luxury floating vessel was recorded on the Company s books at its original cost basis of $0 based on its fully depreciated value at the transfer date. As the Miss Leah has been recorded on the books of the Company at a value of $0, there is no depreciation recorded. 
   
 The Company capitalized the costs of developing the architectural plans for the Luxuria model floating vessel and began amortizing the cost over their estimated useful life of seven years beginning April 1, 2016.

 (6) STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT 
   
 At September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, the Company has 90,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 common stock authorized and 8,987,000 (unaudited) and 6,720,000 issued and outstanding.

The agreement was amended on March 1, 2016. As amended StockVest agreed to provide us with services from March 12, 2016 until June 12, 2016, in exchange for $500 and one hundred fifty thousand (150,000) shares of our restricted common stock. We valued these shares at the price of $.10 per share, based on the most recent sale of common stock by the Company, or an aggregate of $15,000 upon issuance, which was recognized over the life of the contract. 
   
 In June 2016, the Company issued 250,000 shares of our restricted common stock to a related party consultant and principal stockholder in exchange for $25,000 of cash.

This was the second issuance as was required under this two year consulting agreement. 
   
 In June 2016 the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of redeemable Series A preferred stock to the Company s founder and CEO. The Company recorded these shares at their redemption value of $1,000 which approximates fair value. The only rights and privileges of these shares is super voting rights, 1,000 votes for each preferred share and the right to redeem the shares for $1,000. 
   
 In August 2016 the Company issued 100,000 shares of our restricted common stock as a loan fee recorded as a discount valued at the  price of $10,000 or $0.10 per share based on recent stock sales on a new short-term loan, which is being amortized over the life of the loan  (See note 10). 
   
 In August 2016, the Company issued 200,000 shares of our restricted common stock to a related party consultant and principal stockholder in exchange for $20,000 of cash. 
   
 In August 2016, the Company issued 425,000 shares of our restricted common stock to a former officer and director in exchange for the construction of the barge bottom for Luxuria I, delivered in February, valued at $70,000. (See notes 4 and 8(c)) 
   
 In August 2016, the Company issued 600,000 shares of our restricted common stock in exchange for $36,000 of cash.

 (7) RENTAL PROPERTY AND RELATED NOTE PAYABLE, continued 
   
 June 20, 2022, which was memorialized in the form of a promissory note in June 2015, effective September 25, 2014. (See note 8) Due to the related party relationship between the Company and the Predecessor the luxury floating vessel was recorded on the Company s books at its original cost basis of $0 based on its fully depreciated value at the transfer date. Accordingly, the Company charged additional paid-in capital as a distribution for $100,000. 
   
 (8) RELATED PARTIES 
   
  a) Rental property  
   
 On September 25, 2014, the Company acquired the Miss Leah, a luxury floating vessel built on a barge platform from the Predecessor which is owned by the founders brother. As part of this acquisition transaction the Company issued a promissory note in June 2015 to the Predecessor in the amount of $100,000, carrying an interest rate of 2% effective September 25, 2014, with a maturity date of June 20, 2022. (See Note 7) The Company recorded the payable in September 2014 which was formalized with this promissory note in June 2015. 
   
  b) Related party payable  
   
 In the last quarter 2014, the Predecessor continued to receive some of the revenue from and to pay some of the expenses related to the rental of the Miss Leah.

(9) CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK 
   
 The Company has only one revenue producing asset at this time, and that asset is located in Boston Harbor. The rental season at this location is generally from late March through October. The Company primarily utilizes one booking agent to schedule bookings from customers and collect the revenues. If required the Company believes it could obtain bookings through an alternative provider.

 (10) SHORT TERM LOAN AND SHORT TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE INCLUDING PREMIUM 
   
 On July 9, 2015, the company entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $151,700 with a shareholder. The company issued 250,000 common shares to the shareholder as consideration for providing us the loan. The shares were valued at $25,000, or $0.10 per share (based on the recent private placement sales) was recorded as a discount and is being amortized at a rate of $2,083 per month over the life of the loan. The note bears interest at the rate of 10%. Prepaid interest in the amount of $15,000 and a loan fee of $1,700 were deducted from the proceeds of the loan. These were amortized each month at the rate of $1,250 and $142 over the life of the loan, respectively. We are obligated to pay the principal and interest due on July 9, 2016, which is past due as of the date of this filing. The loan is secured by the Miss Leah, our company owned vessel. The note balance at September 30, 2016, is $100,000 net of the discount of $0. The note holder sold $51,700 of this note to a third party in August 2016, and the Company modified the new $51,700 note to add a conversion feature at a conversion rate of 60% of the trading price of the Company s common stock. This note is considered stock settled debt and accordingly the Company recorded a premium on the debt of $34,467as a charge to interest expense on the modification date. This third party converted $4,032 of this in exchange for 42,000 shares in August 2016, and $2,688 of the premium was reclassified to additional paid in capital. The Company paid $6,000 in interest to the original holder during the third quarter 2016. The Company is currently negotiating an extension or modification of the remaining balance of the note. 
   
 (11) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 (12) SHORT TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE, NET OF DISCOUNTS 
   
 Convertible debt was as follows at September 30, 2016: 

On August 11, 2016, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and a secured convertible promissory note for $610,000, the Company drew $305,000 and received $227,500 in cash under this six month secured convertible promissory note. This note is secured by all the assets of the Company, inclusive of the Miss Leah and the Luxuria 1, and the member interests of its wholly owned LLC. This note is structured in two parts, first the initial $305,000 as drawn and a subsequent $305,000 which can be drawn at the Company s option in amount/s determined by the Company. This note does not carry a stated interest rate, but carries an Original Issue Discount (OID) that totals $100,000 and is proportional to the total amount borrowed. An OID of $50,000 was recorded as a discount to the note for the initial draw and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. In addition, the Company is required to pay $10,000 of the lender s legal fees (pro rata to the draws) and $22,500 of brokerage commission which was withheld from the initial $305,000 draw, both of which were also recorded as debt discounts and are being amortized over the six month life of the note. The stock fee due under the investment banking agreement was waived. Also, the Company is required to issue 100,000 shares of restricted common stock which was valued at $0.10 per share based on recent stock sales and recorded as a discount to the note and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. This note requires a $200,000 partial prepayment if and when the Company sells the Miss Leah. The note is personally guaranteed by the Company s CEO, Robert Rowe. In event of default the note will carry an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. 
   
 The total note is convertible into common stock upon an event of default as follows: 
   
 Lender has the right at any time following an Event of Default, at its election, to convert (each instance of conversion is referred to herein as a   Conversion  ) all or any part of the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance into shares (  Conversion Shares  ) of fully paid and non-assessable common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (  Common Stock  ), of Company as per the following conversion formula: the number of Conversion Shares equals the amount being converted (the   Conversion Amount  ) divided by the Conversion Price (as defined below).  
   
 Subject to the adjustments set forth herein, the conversion price (the   Conversion Price  ) for each Conversion shall be equal to 60% (the   Conversion Factor  ) multiplied by the lowest Closing Bid Price in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion. Additionally, if at any time after the Effective Date, the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future Conversions. Finally, in addition to the Default Effect, if any Major Default occurs after the Effective Date (other than an Event of Default for failure to pay the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance on the Maturity Date), the Conversion Factor shall automatically be reduced for all future Conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first three (3) Major Defaults that occur after the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, each occurrence of any Major Default shall be deemed to be a separate occurrence for purposes of the foregoing reductions in Conversion Factor, even if the same Major Default occurs three (3) separate times). For example, the first time the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes of this example. If, thereafter, there are three (3) separate occurrences of a Major Default pursuant to Section 4.1(a), then for purposes of this example the Conversion Factor would be reduced by 5% for the first such occurrence, and so on for each of the second and third occurrences of such Default.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 
   
 We were founded in June of 2014 to commercialize luxury living vessels. We plan to generate revenues from the sale of and rental of the vessels initially in South Florida. Our newly developed Luxuria model features a South Florida modern style, and is approximately one thousand eight hundred (1,800) square feet under air. The vessel offers amenities typically found in a luxury home. 
   
  Three (3) Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
   
 We had revenues of $21,913 and $23,350 for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, or a six point two percent (6.2%) decrease. 
   
 Cost of revenues was $3,510 compared to $4,278 for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, or an eighteen percent (18%) decrease. This decrease was primarily due to an decrease in Homeaway fees. 
   
 Gross margin was $18,403 and $19,072 for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
 General and administrative expenses were $40,537 compared to $31,886 for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of twenty seven point one percent (27.1%). General and administrative expenses are principally composed of public company expenses, insurance, maintenance, officer pay and travel. The primary increases were in public company expenses. 
   
 Our professional fees were $46,804 compared to $69,232 for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of 30%. The decrease was primarily related to the completion of our S-1 filing in the fourth quarter 2015. 
   
 Our interest expense was $118,062 compared to $11,266 for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $106,796 or nine hundred forty-eight percent (948%). This increase is due to the interest expense accrued on the payable to affiliate for the acquisition of the vessel and the amortization of prepaid interest, loan fee and other loan discounts on our short term loan received in August 2016. 
   
 We recorded a net loss of ($374,116) compared to ($93,312) for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
  Nine (9) Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
   
 We had revenues of $34,553 and $29,301 for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, or a seventeen point nine percent (17.9%) increase. 
   
 Cost of revenues was $11,585 compared to $8,560 for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, or a thirty five point three percent (35.3%) increase. This increase was primarily due to an increase in marina fees. 
   
 Gross margin was $22,968 and $20,741 for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
 General and administrative expenses were $113,453 compared to $84,261 for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of thirty four point six percent (34.6%). General and administrative expenses are principally composed of public company expenses, insurance, maintenance, officer pay and travel. The primary increases were in public company expenses. 
   
 Our professional fees were $112,903 compared to $136,922 for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of seventeen percent (17%). The decrease was primarily related to the completion of our S-1 filing in the fourth quarter 2015. 

17 

Our interest expense was $141,066 compared to $12,698 for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $128,368 or one thousand eleven percent (1,011%). This increase is due to the interest expense accrued on the payable to affiliate for the acquisition of the vessel and the amortization of prepaid interest, loan fee, other and loan discounts on our short term loan received in August 2016. 
   
 We recorded a net loss of ($532,026) compared to ($213,140) for the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activities  
   
  Cash Flow Activities  
   
 Our cash increased $64,221 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily the result of our short term loan received in August 2016. 
   
  Financing Activities  
   
 During the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2016 we funded our working capital requirements principally through the short term loan received in August 2016 and the sale of common stock. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following: 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, payables, accrued expenses and loans. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. We consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements to approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature. 
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 Revenue is recognized when earned, generally starting when the rental customer takes temporary possession of the floating vessel and through their contracted stay. Rental deposits from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the rental period, (generally 7 days or less), once the rental period begins. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with ASC 605-45. Cost of Revenue includes the marina dockage fees and fees charged by the web site Homeaway, where the floating vessel is advertised for rent. 
   
  Property and Equipment  
   
 Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. 

18 

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets  
   
 We periodically evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4). 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 (See  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  in Note 3 j) of Notes to the unaudited consolidated Financial Statements.) 
   
  Plan of Operations  
   
 Historically, we generated revenue from the short-term vacation rental of the Miss Leah, a company owned vessel located in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts. At present, we expect to generate revenue from this vessel as a short-term vacation rental in the future. We listed this vessel for sale in June of 2015. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $111,700 for our operational needs. Currently, our operating expenses are approximately $12,500 per month. We were obligated to repay an outstanding loan in one lump payment in the amount of $151,700 on July 9, 2016, which is past due as of the date of this filing. In September 2016, $51,700 of this loan balance was sold by the holder to a third party, who has converted the entire balance into 1,574,740 shares of our common stock as of November 4, 2016. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional funds to meet our monthly operating costs we would have available cash for our operating needs for approximately nine (9) months before repayment of the $100,000 balance due. The Company is currently negotiating an extension or modification of this note. 
   
 We plan to focus our future efforts on commercializing luxury living vessels designed in a South Florida modern style. We completed the design of the Luxuria model in the first quarter of 2015. Luxuria will be approximately one thousand eight hundred (1,800) square feet, with two (2) bedrooms and bathrooms, and sleeps up to six (6) people. 
   
 We plan to use the Luxuria as a short-term vacation rental property in South Florida and for outright sale. We believe that using the Luxuria as a short-term vacation rental in South Florida could provide a year round source of cash flow and a model for future custom build orders. 
   
 While rental of the Miss Leah presently and Luxuria in the future, are expected to provide a relatively steady revenue stream to us, the construction and sale of custom designed and built luxury floating vessels are expected to generate significantly greater revenues and potential profits. 
   
 We located Lauderdale Marine Center to construct the Luxuria models at the price of approximately $550,000 per vessel. As of September 30, 2016, we have expended $182,121 for the construction of Luxuria I, of which $70,000 was a non-cash payment in common stock of the Company. 
   
 We anticipate that each vessel will cost approximately $550,000 to construct. Construction will take between five (5) to seven (7) months, per vessel. We will require additional funds to develop and carry out our future plans including construction of our first vessel which is approaching 50% completion. We plan to begin marketing each vessel when manufacturing commences. 
   
 Our first barge bottom was delivered in mid-February 2016. It was constructed by the stockholder with the existing October 2014 $250,000 subscription agreement and we expected to issue common stock under this subscription agreement in exchange for the transfer of the barge bottom to us. Pursuant to an executed agreement, we issued 425,000 shares of our common stock as payment for this barge bottom, valued at $70,000, or $0.16 per share, under an agreement dated August 11, 2016, at which time the market price of the stock was $0.36 per share. This party has not accepted the stock certificate and recently informed the Company that they want to renegotiate since the market price of the common stock has fallen to $0.085 per share. 

19 

Our cash balance at September 30, 2016 was $111,700, which is approximately nine (9) months of net cash outflow. 
   
 We have an accumulated deficit of $855,454 from inception to September 30, 2016. A portion of this accumulated deficit are non-cash expenses, which resulted from the amortization of our issuance of common stock in exchange for prepaid services and the amortization of prepaid interest and discounts related to the short-term debt and the value of the resultant embedded derivative. In addition, approximately $70,000 of cash expense is directly attributable to the filing of our Form S-1. 
   
 Our independent registered public accountant has included a going concern explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion for the periods through December 31, 2015. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months. 
   
 Our company owned vessel, the Miss Leah, is listed for sale at the price of $400,000. If sold, the proceeds will provide sufficient capital to construct one Luxuria model. The retail price of the Luxuria is between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. The subsequent sale of the Luxuria vessel would provide sufficient capital to construct two more Luxuria models. The sale of two (2) additional Luxuria models would provide sufficient net cash to construct four (4) Luxuria models. 
   
 Our future plans are contingent upon the receipt of capital from either: (i) the receipt of at least $500,000 from the sale of our securities or (ii) the sale of our company owned vessel. 
   
 Until such time as the Miss Leah is sold, we will continue to rent the vessel on a short term basis. We plan to market the Luxuria models to yacht brokers, real estate brokers and boat dealerships. 
   
 Should we receive funding of $500,000 from the sale of our securities we plan to construct a second Luxuria vessel. 
   
 On August 11, 2016, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and a secured convertible promissory note for $610,000, the Company drew $305,000 and received $227,500 in cash under this six month secured convertible promissory note. This note is secured by all the assets of the Company, inclusive of the Miss Leah and the Luxuria 1, and the member interests of its wholly owned LLC. This note is structured in two parts, first the initial $305,000 as drawn and a subsequent $305,000 which can be drawn at the Company s option in amount/s determined by the Company. This note does not carry a stated interest rate, but carries an Original Issue Discount (OID) that totals $100,000 and is proportional to the total amount borrowed. An OID of $50,000 was recorded as a discount to the note for the initial draw and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. In addition, the Company is required to pay $10,000 of the lender s legal fees (pro rata to the draws) and $22,500 of brokerage commission which was withheld from the initial $305,000 draw, both of which were also recorded as debt discounts and are being amortized over the six month life of the note. Also, the Company is required to issue 100,000 shares of restricted common stock which was valued at $0.10 per share based on recent stock sales and recorded as a discount to the note and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. This note requires a $200,000 partial prepayment if and when the Company sells the Miss Leah. The note is personally guaranteed by the Company s CEO, Robert Rowe. In event of default the note will carry an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. 
   
 Lender has the right at any time following an Event of Default, at its election, to convert (each instance of conversion is referred to herein as a   Conversion  ) all or any part of the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance into shares (  Conversion Shares  ) of fully paid and non-assessable common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (  Common Stock  ), of Company as per the following conversion formula: the number of Conversion Shares equals the amount being converted (the   Conversion Amount  ) divided by the Conversion Price (as defined below). 

20 

Subject to the adjustments set forth herein, the conversion price (the   Conversion Price  ) for each Conversion shall be equal to 60% (the   Conversion Factor  ) multiplied by the lowest Closing Bid Price in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion. Additionally, if at any time after the Effective Date, the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future Conversions. Finally, in addition to the Default Effect, if any Major Default occurs after the Effective Date (other than an Event of Default for failure to pay the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance on the Maturity Date), the Conversion Factor shall automatically be reduced for all future Conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first three (3) Major Defaults that occur after the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, each occurrence of any Major Default shall be deemed to be a separate occurrence for purposes of the foregoing reductions in Conversion Factor, even if the same Major Default occurs three (3) separate times). For example, the first time the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes of this example. If, thereafter, there are three (3) separate occurrences of a Major Default pursuant to Section 4.1(a), then for purposes of this example the Conversion Factor would be reduced by 5% for the first such occurrence, and so on for each of the second and third occurrences of such Major Default. 
   
 Due to the variable conversion terms and certain default provisions, the embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and recorded as a derivative liability at an initial fair value of $378,624 with $217,500 recorded as a debt discount and $161,124 as a derivative expense with a subsequent change in fair value to $404,160 at September 30, 2016.

 Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  
   
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
   
 Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

   On August 11, 2016, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and a secured convertible promissory note for $610,000, the Company drew $305,000 and received $227,500 in cash under this six month secured convertible promissory note. This note is secured by all the assets of the Company, inclusive of the Miss Leah and the Luxuria 1, and the member interests of its wholly owned LLC. This note is structured in two parts, first the initial $305,000 as drawn and a subsequent $305,000 which can be drawn at the Company s option in amount/s determined by the Company. This note does not carry a stated interest rate, but carries an Original Issue Discount (OID) that totals $100,000 and is proportional to the total amount borrowed. An OID of $50,000 was recorded as a discount to the note for the initial draw and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. In addition, the Company is required to pay $10,000 of the lender s legal fees (pro rata to the draws) and $22,500 of brokerage commission which was withheld from the initial $305,000 draw, both of which were also recorded as debt discounts and are being amortized over the six month life of the note. The stock fee due under the investment banking agreement was waived. Also, the Company is required to issue 100,000 shares of restricted common stock which was valued at $0.10 per share based on recent stock sales and recorded as a discount to the note and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. This note requires a $200,000 partial prepayment if and when the Company sells the Miss Leah. The note is personally guaranteed by the Company s CEO, Robert Rowe. In event of default the note will carry an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. 
   
 The total note is convertible into common stock upon an event of default as follows: 
   
 Lender has the right at any time following an Event of Default, at its election, to convert (each instance of conversion is referred to herein as a   Conversion  ) all or any part of the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance into shares (  Conversion Shares  ) of fully paid and non-assessable common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (  Common Stock  ), of Company as per the following conversion formula: the number of Conversion Shares equals the amount being converted (the   Conversion Amount  ) divided by the Conversion Price (as defined below).  
   
 Subject to the adjustments set forth herein, the conversion price (the   Conversion Price  ) for each Conversion shall be equal to 60% (the   Conversion Factor  ) multiplied by the lowest Closing Bid Price in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion. Additionally, if at any time after the Effective Date, the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future Conversions. Finally, in addition to the Default Effect, if any Major Default occurs after the Effective Date (other than an Event of Default for failure to pay the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance on the Maturity Date), the Conversion Factor shall automatically be reduced for all future Conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first three (3) Major Defaults that occur after the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, each occurrence of any Major Default shall be deemed to be a separate occurrence for purposes of the foregoing reductions in Conversion Factor, even if the same Major Default occurs three (3) separate times). For example, the first time the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes of this example. If, thereafter, there are three (3) separate occurrences of a Major Default pursuant to Section 4.1(a), then for purposes of this example the Conversion Factor would be reduced by 5% for the first such occurrence, and so on for each of the second and third occurrences of such Default.

  Item 5.    Other Information  
   
 In October 2016, the Company issued 600,000 shares of our restricted common stock in exchange for $36,000 of cash. 
   
 In October and November 2016, the Company issued 1,532,740 shares of our common stock upon conversion of $47,668 under the short term note including premium. 
   
 In November 2016, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to the CEO for services valued at $577,700, or $0.0577 per share, the trading price of the shares on the day the legal obligation to issue the shares arose.
