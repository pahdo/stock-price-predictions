1.   
       Basis of Presentation    

These unaudited consolidated financial statements
of Axion Power International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, include the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary, Axion Power
Battery Manufacturing, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and its two inactive wholly owned subsidiaries, Axion Power Corporation,
a Canadian Federal corporation, and C   T Co. Inc., an Ontario corporation (collectively, the  Company ). 

In the opinion of management the accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present
fairly the financial position, statements of income and comprehensive income and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and footnotes thereto in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The results of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of results of income and comprehensive income for the Company s 2016 calendar year. 

As approved by our board of directors and shareholders,
we effected a 1-for-35 stock split of our common shares and Series A warrants on July 14, 2015. During 2015, there were 1,457 true-up
rounding shares issued due to the above mentioned reverse stock split. 

As approved by our board of directors and shareholders,
we effected a 1-for-400 stock split of our common shares effective July 15, 2016. We did not effect a reverse split of any of our
warrants and instead, each warrant is exercisable into 1/400th of a share of our common stock. All share related and per share
information was adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split from the beginning of the earliest period presented. 

We have again sought approval from our shareholders
to effect a reverse split of our common stock in a range of 1-for-100 to 1-for-400 as set forth in our Definitive Proxy Statement
on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on October 17, 2016. As stated in the 14A, we have asked our shareholders for their consent
no later than November 14, 2016. This reverse split is to increase our stock price and to make shares available for conversion
for satisfaction of our November 2015 notes. 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, assumptions
and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from the estimates. 

2.      New
Accounting Pronouncements   

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ).  ASU
2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice in financial reporting across all industries by clarifying certain existing
principles in ASC 230,  Statement of Cash Flows,  including providing additional guidance on how and what an entity should
consider in determining the classification of certain cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for the reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance
will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to employee share-based
payment accounting, which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based compensation payments
are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This amendment will be effective prospectively for reporting periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new accounting
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic
842), which requires lessees to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities classified as operating leases on the balance
sheet. The amendment will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures. 

On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with
any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only
have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits
offsetting within a jurisdiction. The new guidance will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years
(i.e., in the first quarter of 2017 for calendar year-end companies). Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning
of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this newly
issued guidance to its consolidated financial statements.

  (unaudited)  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
 Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , that simplifies the measurement of inventory for all entities.
The amendment applies to all inventories that are measured using first-in, first-out or average cost. The guidance requires an
entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance must be applied prospectively and will
be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the
expected impact, if any, of the adoption of the newly issued guidance to the consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,
 Interest   Imputation of Interest (Topic 225-20): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issue Costs , that simplifies
the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by these amendments. This guidance should be
applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the
period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company elected early adoption of this newly
issued guidance, and there was no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,
 Consolidations (Topic 225-20): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which affects current consolidation guidance. The
guidance changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of
legal entities. This guidance must be applied using one of two retrospective application methods and is effective for fiscal years,
and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted this new guidance,
and there was no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,
 Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating
the Concept of Extraordinary Items , which changed the requirements for reporting extraordinary and unusual items in the income
statement. The update eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. The presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are
unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature
and infrequently occurring. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented
in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this newly issued guidance did not have an impact to the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

3.      Inventories   

Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost
or market value, and adjusted as appropriate for decreases in valuation and obsolescence. Adjustments to the valuation and obsolescence
reserves are made after analyzing market conditions, historical sales activity, inventory costs and inventory composition to determine
appropriate reserve levels. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Many components and raw materials we
purchase have minimum order quantities.  

A summary of inventory at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
is as follows: 

AXION POWER INTERNATIONAL, INC.  

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

  (unaudited)  

Warrants consist of the following: 

As of September 30, 2016, there were no Series
B warrants classified as derivative liabilities. On April 27, 2016, 10,000 Series B warrants were exercised resulting in the issuance
of 29 shares of the Company s common stock. The remaining 24,521 Series B warrants expired on April 29, 2016. In addition,
as of September 30, 2016, there were 11,967,716 warrants also classified as derivative liabilities relating to the November 2015
private placement of senior convertible notes and warrants. We effected a 1-for-400 reverse split of our common stock on July 15,
2016 (as contractually required as a result of needing shares for conversions of our November 2015 notes); however, the number
of warrants was not split and instead each warrant is exercisable or convertible into 1/400th of a share of our common stock. 

5.      Equity
Compensation   

The Company adopted ASC 718   Compensation
  Stock Compensation   whereby employee-compensation expense related to stock based payments is recorded over the
requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company s accounting policy for equity instruments
issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of ASC 505-50   Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees  .  The measurement date for fair value of the equity instruments is determined by
the earlier of (i) the date at which commitment for performance by the vendor or consultant is reached, or (ii) the date at which
the consultant or vendor s performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value
of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement. 

The stock based compensation expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $35,955 and $244,771 of which $0 and $112,793 was for independent directors 
compensation in lieu of cash, respectively. In May 2016, the Board of Directors chose to forgive the previously reported $19,719
owed in Director s fees for the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as forgive the $15,000 stock compensation for consulting
services also reported for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Outstanding compensatory options consist of
the following based on grant date: 

AXION POWER INTERNATIONAL,
INC.  

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

  (unaudited)  

Non-vested compensatory options consist of
the following based on grant date: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $46,620
of unrecognized compensation related to non-vested options granted under the plans. The Company expects to recognize this expense
over a weighted average period of 1.25 years. We have not granted any options in 2016. 

6.      Earnings
(Loss) Per Share   

Basic loss per share is computed by
dividing loss available to common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
(the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by assuming that any dilutive convertible
securities outstanding were converted, with related preferred stock dividend requirements and outstanding common shares
adjusted accordingly. It also assumes that outstanding common shares were increased by shares issuable upon exercise of those
stock options for which the market price exceeds the exercise price, less shares which could have been purchased by us with
the related proceeds. In periods of losses, diluted loss per share is computed on the same basis as basic loss per share as
the inclusion of any other potential shares outstanding would be anti-dilutive. 

If the Company had generated earnings during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company would have added 482,659,713 and 68 respectively, of common equivalent
shares to the weighted average shares outstanding to compute the diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The Company had unexercised
Series B warrants of 34,521 outstanding as of September 30, 2015. The remaining unexercised outstanding 34,521 Series B warrants
would have added 98 common shares as permitted by the Amendment to the original warrant agreement. 

7.      Other
Income   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company recognized $31,576 in other income. The Company sold various pieces of zero value equipment. 

8.      Notes
with Landlords   

At December 31, 2015, the Company had
a balance of $237,600 in notes with its landlords for its two New Castle facilities, which was settled as of September 30, 2016. As per the note agreement the Company
made payments of $25,000 per month to Becan Development and the final payment due in April was reduced by the original
$19,297 lease deposit. In addition to the principal payments, Becan Development also received $2,300 in interest. As per the
note agreement with S S Partnership, the Company made monthly installment payments of $17,200 for a total of $137,600
in principal payments. The Company also paid $12,592 of accrued interest. As of April 1, 2016, the Company has moved from
the Greenridge facility as planned and consolidated to the Clover Lane facility. 

At September 30, 2016 there is no principal
or remaining interest outstanding. 

9.      Subordinated
Convertible Notes and Warrants   

During 2013 ,  the Company sold $1,000,000
principal amount of its Subordinated Convertible Notes (the  Subordinated Notes ) to investors consisting of management
and directors of the Company and one individual accredited investor. The sale of the Subordinated Notes did not carry any additional
fees and expenses, so the Company received the entire $1 million in proceeds from the Subordinated Notes at closing. The Subordinated
Notes are subordinated in right of repayment to the Company s now expired 2013 Senior Notes and were to mature 91 days subsequent
to the maturity date of the 2013 Senior Notes. The Subordinated Notes bear interest at the rate of 8% per year. The Subordinated
Notes may be converted and/or prepaid in cash. The conversion price for the Subordinated Notes is $184,800 per share. The holders
of the Subordinated Convertible Notes were issued five year warrants
to purchase 1,097 shares of Company common stock ( Subordinated Warrants ).  Each Subordinated Warrant has
an exercise price of $528.50 and is convertible into 1/400 of a share.

INC.  

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

  (unaudited)  

The fair value of the warrants, issued in connection
with the Subordinated Notes is $304,000 in the aggregate and was calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
with the following assumptions: (i) expected life of 5 years, (ii) volatility of 80%, (iii) risk free interest rate of 0.75% and
(iv) dividend yield of zero. 

The outstanding principal balance at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, related to the Subordinated Notes is $65,000. The subordinated notes remain outstanding as a result
of a verbal agreement with the noteholders to continue to extend the maturity thereof. 

10.      Public
offering of common stock, Series A warrants and Series B warrants   

Effective October
29, 2014, the Company consummated an underwritten public offering consisting of 53,572 shares of common stock ( Common Stock ),
together with Series A warrants to purchase 53,572 shares of its Common Stock ( Series A Warrants ) and Series B warrants
to purchase 1,875,000 shares of its Common Stock ( Series B Warrants ) for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately
$6.1 million and net proceeds of $5.5 million. The public offering price for each share of Common Stock, together with one Series
A Warrant and one Series B Warrant, was $113.75.  The Series A Warrants may be exercised for a period of five years and have
an exercise price of $113.75 per share of Common Stock. The Series B Warrants were originally exercisable for a period of 15 months
from the date of closing and expired on April 29, 2016 (due to an extension) and had an exercise price of $113.75 per share of
Common Stock. In connection with the offering, the Company granted to the underwriter a 45-day option to acquire up to 8,036 additional
shares of Common Stock and/or up to 8,036 additional Series A Warrants and/or up to 281,250 additional Series B Warrants. The Company
has also closed on the underwriter s exercise of the over-allotment option on the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants.
The Company s common stock and Series A Warrants are now listed on the OTCQB Capital Market under the symbols  AXPW 
and  AXPWW , respectively. On June 15, 2015, as the result of an agreement with the holders of our Series A warrants
and Series B warrants, we adjusted the terms of our Series A warrants so that the exercise price was reduced to $.50, which number
was changed to $17.50 as a result of our July 14, 2015 1-for -35 reverse stock split. The Series A warrants were not further reverse-split
as a result of our July 2016 1:400 reverse split and instead each warrant is exercisable into 1/400  th  of a share of
our common stock. The Series B warrants were not subject to the 1-for-35 reverse split. 

On April 26, 2016, 10,000 Series B warrants
were exercised and 29 shares of the Company s common stock were issued. As of September 30, 2016 there are no Series B warrants.
The remaining 24,521 unexercised Series B warrants expired on April 29, 2016. 

Accounting for the Series B warrants   

Pursuant to ASC 815-40, due to the net settlement
terms included in the Series B warrants, which requires an increased number of shares to be issued if the price of the Company s
common stock falls, the Company determined that the Series B warrants were not indexed to the Company s own stock and must
be recognized separately as a derivative liability in the consolidated balance sheet, measured at fair value and marked to market
each reporting period. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the fair value of the Series B warrants was estimated to be $0 and $35,764, respectively. 

The change in the fair value of the Series
B warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:

The change in fair value of the Series B warrant
liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is a follows: 

Fair Value Disclosure  

The Company has two Level 3 financial instruments.
Prior to the expiration of the Series B warrants on April 29, 2016 there were three Level 3 financial instruments. 

On November 4, 2015, we entered into a financing
transaction for the sale of convertible notes and warrants issued by us with gross proceeds of $9,000,000 to us. Upon closing of
the sale of the notes and warrants, which occurred on November 5, 2015, we received cash proceeds of $1.85 million and deposited
an additional $7,150,000 into a series of control accounts in our name. Under the original terms of the notes, we are permitted
to withdraw funds from our control accounts (i) in connection with certain conversions of the notes or (ii) otherwise, as follows:
$1 million on each 30-day anniversary of the commencing on the 30  th  day after the effective date of a registration
statement being filed in connection with the transaction until there are no more funds in the control accounts, subject in each
instance to equity conditions set forth in the convertible notes. As a result of the January 28, 2016 amendments to the notes,
another $1.8 million was released on that date, and the balance of $5.35 million was to be released in 8 equal monthly installments
commencing on May 2, 2016 (subsequently amended to be May 6, 2016), subject to terms and conditions set forth in the notes. 

We received approximately $1,790,000 in net
proceeds at closing, which occurred on November 5, 2015, after deducting our placement agent s legal fee of $60,000. Offering
expenses, including our placement agent s fee, were approximately $183,750, which were paid out of operating cash at Closing.
At each release of funds starting on May 6, 2016, we were to receive approximately $620,000 in net proceeds, after deducting our
placement agent s fee of $50,000, if equity conditions (certain stock price and volume and other conditions set forth in
the loan documents from our November 5, 2015) were met. As a result of a further waiver and amendment entered into on May 1, 2016,
the equity conditions were waived with respect to a release of $310,000 to us on May 6, 2016. Further, the waiver and amendment
(i) waives equity conditions for our ability to make all installment and preinstallment payments in stock through May 6, 2017,
and (ii) reduces the preinstallment and installment conversion prices to 75% of an average vwap price over the five trading days
preceding the date of issuance. In June of 2016 an additional $355,000 was released. 

In the third quarter of 2016 and subsequently,
we received the following releases from the control accounts as follows: July $668,866, August $305,889, September $305,889 and
October $288,889. 

The initial conversion price of the notes was $492.00 per share
(for optional conversions only and not Company amortization payments), and the initial exercise price of the 10,975,608 warrants
was $1.29 per share (and post reverse split, each warrant is exercisable into 1/400th of a share of our common stock). 

As a result of the  rollover  of
$363,530 of principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of our August 2015 Bridge Notes, on November 10, 2015, an additional
note in the principal amount of $363,530 and an additional 443,328 warrants were issued to replace the rolled over Bridge Notes.  

The outstanding principal bears interest at
9% per annum and shall be repaid or converted at monthly installment dates over a 14-month period. Additionally, the notes are
convertible by the holder at any time after issuance. Pursuant to the optional conversion feature of these notes (as opposed to
the monthly Company conversions which are at a discount formula as set forth below), the Company would deliver the number of shares
of common stock equal to the outstanding principal amount, accrued interest amount, and a make whole amount equal to the interest
that would be accrued on the conversion amount until maturity, divided by the fixed conversion price of $492.00. Additionally,
a portion of the outstanding amount would have been exchanged for common shares at each Monthly Installment Date at a conversion
price equal to the lower of the conversion price in effect and 85% of the fair value of the common shares the trading day prior
to the installment date (now 75%). On the 23  rd  date prior to any installment date, shares to be delivered based upon
the conversion price formula for the installment amount, and then on the installment date in question, the amount
of shares to be delivered is recalculated for the conversion price formula on that installment date, and if the conversion
price is lower on the installment date than on the preinstallment date, a number of shares equal to the number to be
delivered on the installment date less the number of shares delivered on the preinstallment date is delivered to the
investor. The number of common shares deliverable under the contract is limited by a beneficial ownership cap of 4.99% for
any single investor (except for one investor which has a cap of 9.99%), so shares may be deemed issued but held in abeyance
by the transfer agent until the investor is able to accept further shares without exceeding the beneficial ownership cap.

As the Company was required to separate the
conversion option in the notes under ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging,  the Company recorded the bifurcated conversion option
valued at $1.33 million as a derivative liability, which creates additional discount on the debt. The derivative liability is marked
to market through the income statement each reporting period, while the discount created on the convertible notes is accreted as
interest expense over the maturity period of the debt. Additionally, the convertible notes were issued to the investors in a basket
transaction with warrants that are classified as derivative liabilities. These warrants, initially valued at $725,111 ($691,861
as discount on the debt and $33,250 as issuance costs for compensation to the underwriter), are also marked through the income
statement each reporting period, while further discount is created on the convertible notes, and is accreted as interest expense
using the effective interest method over the life of the debt. 

At inception, the warrants were valued by calibrating
the aggregate fair value of the notes and warrants to the transaction price, as required by ASC 820. Calibrating the valuation
model to ensure that the model is consistent with the fair value at initial recognition provides a basis for estimating the inputs
required in the analysis that are not directly observable. For each subsequent reporting date, the warrants are valued based on
the payoff structure, considering the change in assumptions between the inception and the subsequent reporting date. 

The conversion feature fair value is determined
at inception and for each reporting date using a  with  and  without  analysis, based on the payoff structure
of the notes. The same key assumptions utilized in the warrants valuation were considered in the conversion feature fair value, 

Using the Calibration model, to calculate the
mark to market value at September 30, 2016, the following key assumptions were utilized in both the valuations of the notes and
warrants as follows: (i) risk free interest rate 0.29%, (ii) credit spread 125%, (iii) volatility 41.57%, and (iv) stock price
$0.01. 

Derivative liability relating to the 2015 Private Placement   

The change in the fair value of the 2015 Private Placement derivative
liability is as follows:  

Securities Purchase Agreement  

The notes and warrants were issued pursuant
to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement among us and the investors named therein. The Purchase Agreement provided for the
sale of the notes and warrants for gross proceeds of $9,000,000 to us. 

Ranking   

The notes are senior unsecured obligations
of us. 

Maturity Date   

Unless earlier converted or redeemed, the notes
mature 14 months from the Closing, subject to the right of the investors to extend the date (i) if an event of default under the
notes has occurred and is continuing or any event shall have occurred and be continuing that with the passage of time and the failure
to cure would result in an event of default under the Notes and (ii) for a period of 20 business days after the consummation of
a fundamental transaction if certain events occur.

Interest   

The notes bear interest at the rate of 9%
per annum and are compounded4 monthly, on the first calendar day of each calendar month. The interest rate will increase to 18%
per annum upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default (as described below). Interest on the notes is payable in
arrears on each installment date (as defined below). If a holder elects to convert or redeem all or any portion of a note prior
to the maturity date, all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being converted or redeemed will also be payable. If we elect
to redeem all or any portion of a note prior to the maturity date, all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being redeemed
will also be payable. The amount of interest due at any time is the amount of any interest that, but for any conversion, installment
conversion, acceleration or redemption hereunder on such given date, would have accrued with respect to the conversion amount
or installment amount being converted or redeemed under the note at the interest rate for the period from such given date through
the maturity date of the note. 

Optional Conversion   

All amounts due under the notes are convertible
at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price, which
is subject to adjustment as described below. The notes are initially convertible into shares of our common stock at the initial
price of $492.00 per share. This conversion price is subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations or similar events and
 full ratchet  antidilution provisions. 

Payment of Principal and Interest   

We have agreed to make amortization payments
with respect to the principal amount of each note in shares of our common stock, subject to the satisfaction of certain equity
conditions, or at our option, in cash on each of the following installment dates: the twenty-first trading day after the earlier
of (x) the initial effective date of a registration statement filed in connection with this offering or (y) May 2, 2016; the first
trading day of the calendar month immediately following the initial installment date (or if such date is less than twenty trading
days after the initial installment date, the second calendar month immediately following the initial installment date to the extent);
and then each month through and including the Maturity Date, each in an amount equal to 1/11 of the principal amount of each note.
Payment in stock was originally at 85% of the market price based upon a variable weighted average price formula. 

As a result of the amendment agreements entered
into by us with each selling stockholder on January 28, 2016, an additional $1,800,000 was released from the controlled accounts
on January 28, 2016, starting on May 2, 2016, and continuing for seven consecutive months thereafter on the 1  st  business
day of each such month $667,500 would have been released in total from the controlled accounts. As a result of a further waiver
and amendment entered into on May 1, 2016, the equity conditions were waived with respect to a release of $310,000 to us on May
6, 2016. Further, the waiver and amendment (i) waives equity conditions for our ability to make all installment and preinstallment
payments in stock through May 6, 2017, and (ii) reduces the preinstallment and installment conversion prices to 75% of an average
vwap price over the five trading days preceding the date of issuance. An additional $355,000 was released in June 2016. In the
third quarter of 2016 and subsequently, we received the following releases from the control accounts as follows: July $ 668,866,
August $ 305,889, September $305,889 and October $288,889. 

On August 10, 2016, $3,464,124 from the restricted
cash accounts was released from the control accounts and returned to the investors on a pro rata basis based upon the original
principal amount of the notes issued to each investor. Of the funds released, $3,299,166 was applied against the $9,363,530 notes
and the additional $164,957 was applied as a 5% redemption premium to the investors. The placement agent fees have been reduced
by an amount of $247,437 due to the cash repayment on the senior convertible notes. In addition, the debt discount recorded on
the senior convertible notes was reduced by $339,458 as a result of the cash payment made. 

Acceleration and Deferral of Amortization Amounts   

During each period after an installment date
and prior to the immediately subsequent installment date, a holder may elect to accelerate the amortization of the note at the
applicable amortization conversion price for such prior installment date with respect to any given installment period, the holder
may not elect to effect any acceleration during such installment period if either (x) in the aggregate, all the accelerations in
such installment period exceeds the sum of two (2) other installment amounts, or (y) accelerations have been consummated in four
(4) prior installment periods.   

The holder of a note may, at the holder s
election by giving notice to us, defer the payment of the installment amount due on any installment dates, in whole or in part,
to another installment date, in which case the amount deferred will become part of such subsequent installment date and will continue
to accrue interest.

Events of Default   

The notes contain standard and customary events
of default including but not limited: (i) failure to register our common stock within certain time periods; (ii) failure to make
payments when due under the Notes; and (iii) bankruptcy or insolvency of us. 

If an event of default occurs, each holder
may require us to redeem all or any portion of the notes (including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon), in cash, at a price
equal to the greater of (i) up to 125% of the amount being redeemed, depending on the nature of the default, and (ii) the intrinsic
value of the shares of common stock then issuable upon conversion of the note. 

Fundamental Transactions   

The notes prohibit us from entering into specified
transactions involving a change of control, unless the successor entity assumes in writing all of our obligations under the notes
under a written agreement. 

In the event of transactions involving a change
of control, the holder of a note will have the right to require us to redeem all or any portion of the Note it holds (including
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon) at a price equal to the greater 125% of the amount of the Note being redeemed and the
intrinsic value of the shares of common stock then issuable upon conversion of the note being redeemed. 

Limitations on Conversion and Issuance   

A note may not be converted and shares of common
stock may not be issued under the notes if, after giving effect to the conversion or issuance, the holder together with its affiliates
would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock. At each holder s option, the note blocker
may be raised or lowered to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%. 

As a result of the January 28, 2016 amendment
agreements, there is no exchange cap in this transaction. 

January 28, 2016 Amendment Agreements  

On January 28, 2016, we entered into amendment
agreements with each of the selling stockholders with respect to the November 5, 2015 private placement exempt from securities
registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D. On or about November 20, 2015,
we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 to register the Registrable Securities, and as a result of comments received from
the SEC, we withdrew this original S-1 on January 21, 2016. Subsequent to the withdrawal of the original S-1, we sought to make
certain amendments to the terms of the securities purchase agreement and registration rights agreement, entered into in connection
with the sale of the senior secured convertible notes, as well as to the notes. The amendments are embodied in the amendment agreements
with each of the buyers. 

Changes to the securities purchase agreement are as follows: 

The term  principal market  was changed from the Nasdaq Capital Market to the OTCQB. This change was also made in the notes and accompanying warrants for conformity.   

Section 4(d) was amended to add the following at the end of the Section.  Until the later of June 2, 2016 and the date on which the Buyers are eligible to resell all shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Notes and Warrants (assuming cashless exercise of the Warrants) without restriction under Rule 144 (assuming such Buyers are not then affiliates of we), we may not make any payments to Affiliates of we other than (i) up to $11,800 to repay, in full, that certain bridge note issued by we to Walker Wainwright; (ii) director and Board committee fees in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices, to its non-management directors accruing on or after January 1, 2016 in an amount not to exceed $25,000, in the aggregate, per calendar quarter, (iii) current compensation arrangements (but not accrued and unpaid obligations for compensation to current and former officers of we) to its executive officers upon terms and conditions publicly existing as of December 31, 2015 and/or disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on January 27, 2016; (iv) stock options and/or restricted stock as per normal Board of Directors policy; and (v) customary, reasonable and usual travel and lodging expenses for Company business.     

We no longer have the obligation to obtain shareholder approval for the issuance of securities with respect to the private placement as we are moving our listing to the OTCQB which does not require shareholder approval for issuance of securities in this transaction. Accordingly, the  exchange cap  at 19.9% of issued and outstanding shares was also omitted.

Changes to the notes are as follows: 

The definition of an event upon
        which funds can be released from any of the controlled accounts was amended to read as follows:  Controlled Account
        Release Event  means, as applicable, (i) with respect to any Restricted Principal designated to be converted in a
        Conversion Notice, our receipt of both (A) such Conversion Notice hereunder executed by the Holder in which all, or any part,
        of the Principal to be converted includes any Restricted Principal and (B) written confirmation by the Holder that the shares
        of Common Stock issued pursuant to such Conversion Notice have been properly delivered in accordance with Section 3(c) (in
        each case, as adjusted, if applicable, to reflect the withdrawal of any Conversion Notice, in whole or in part, by the
        Holder, whether pursuant to Section 3(c)(ii) or otherwise), (ii) our receipt of a notice by the Holder electing to effect a
        release of any Restricted Principal to we, (iii) on the date of execution of the certain Amendment Agreements, dated January
        28, 2016, by and among we and certain holders of the Notes, which act as an amendment to the Notes, $1,800,000, and (iv) on
        May 2, 2016, and the first Trading Day of each of the subsequent seven calendar months thereafter, the lesser of (x) the
        amount of Restricted Principal then outstanding hereunder and (y) the Holder Pro Rata Amount of $668,750; provided, in the
        case of clause (iv) above, as of such date of determination, no Equity Conditions Failure then exists. The Buyer hereby
        waives all Equity Condition Failures existing on or before the date of this Agreement.    

Each existing note is being split into
        two notes, one of which is in the principal amount of the buyer s pro rata portion of the initial $3,650,000
        principal amount of funds released from the controlled accounts, and the second of which represents the remaining principal
        amount of the original note issued to that buyer.   

Changes to the registration rights agreement are as follows: 

The filing deadline for the initial registration statement (registering shares to be issued upon conversion of the $3,650,000 principal amount of the notes and interest thereon representing the total amount of funds released from the controlled accounts to date) was changed to January 29, 2016, and the effectiveness deadline for the initial registration statement was changed to February 16, 2016.   

The number of registrable securities was reduced to 26,839 shares of our common stock which may be issued upon conversion of up to $3.65 million principal amount of the notes and 2,416 shares of our common stock which may be issued upon conversion of interest due and owing on the released $3.65 million principal amount.   

The initial notice date for installment payments by us is now the earlier of the effectiveness date of the registration statement being filed on January 29, 2016, and May 2, 2016.   

May 1, 2016 Waiver and Amendment  

The Company has entered into a Waiver and Amendment
( Waiver ) with each of the buyers listed on the Schedule of Buyers attached to the securities purchase agreement.
In each Waiver, the Company and the Buyer agreed as follows: 

With respect to the Notes, the Buyer waives the Volume Failure (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) and the Price Failure (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) on any and all Installment Conversions (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) and delivery of shares for any Pre-Installment Conversion Shares (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) pursuant to an Installment Notice (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) until May 1, 2017.   

Section 3(b)(2) of the Notes is amended by replacing the definition of Conversion Price, as defined in the Notes, with the following definition:   

as of any Conversion Date
or other date of determination, a price per share equal to the lowest of (x) $492.00, subject to adjustment as provided in this
Note (the price set forth in this clause (x), the  Fixed Conversion Price ), (y) 75% of the arithmetic average of the
Weighted Average Prices of the Common Stock during the five (5) consecutive Trading Day period ending immediately preceding the
time of delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice, and (z) 75% of the Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock on the Trading
Day of the delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, all such foregoing determinations to be appropriately
adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction during the applicable
calculation period.  

All references in paragraphs 7, 8 and 11 of the Notes to  Conversion Price  are amended to state  Fixed Conversion Price.    

Paragraph 4 of the Amendment Agreement, dated
        January 28, 2016, among the Company and the Buyers, is amended by adding the following sentence at the end of the paragraph: 

Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this paragraph 4, the Company and the Buyers hereby acknowledge that the Equity Conditions for the Controlled

The Waivers became effective on August 8, 2016
upon entry into waivers by all of the Holders, individually, with the Company. 

2015 Private Placement Debt Rollforward:  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company has issued 37,509,851 shares of its common stock to convert $3,573,412 of principal. In addition on
September 30, 2016, the Company issued 4,453,568 shares of common stock for $272,046 interest and 1,133,546 shares of common
stock for $171,613 make whole interest. The Company will be required to issue additional true-up shares which cannot be
calculated at this time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an extinguishment loss of
$2,043,797 on the conversions of the senior convertible notes. The loss is determined based on the difference between
the conversion price as calculated on the installment date versus the previously calculated price on the notice date. 

As of November 11, 2016 86,638,138 shares
of our common stock have been issued as a result of the conversion of principal, interest, make-whole and true ups related to
the November 2015 Senior Convertible Notes which shall be applied consistent with the conversion notices and for
Pre-installment shares, calculation and application of the applicable Installment price and true-up arising therefrom. Until and unless we are able to make more shares available for conversion of the notes, we will be unable
to meet our obligations to repay the notes, and we will likely be unable to obtain the remaining $321,889 in the control accounts. 

12.      Related
party transactions   

During the first nine months of 2016, the Company
engaged the services of a marketing firm to provide branding and web site development at a cost of $138,338. We engaged the firm
to further provide sales and marketing services for the full year at an estimated cost of $115,000. The principal of this firm
is our Chief Executive Officer s brother in law; however, neither our Chief Executive Officer nor his immediate family has
any direct or indirect interest in the marketing firm. At September 30, 2016, the balance owed to this firm was $13,750 which is
included in the Company s accounts payable balance. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company s
accounts payable balance included $76,540 as a result of related party transactions. Of those transactions, $59,593 was for consulting
fees associated with the previous CEO, $13,750 was for marketing services of which the principal of the firm is our Chief Executive
Officer's' brother in law, however, neither our Chief Executive Officer nor his immediate family has any direct or indirect interest
in the marketing firm, and $3,197 was for employee related travel expense reimbursement. At September 30, 2015, the Company s
accounts payable balance included $64,976 in related party transactions. Of those transactions $59,593, was for fees associated
with the previous CEO, $623 was for director related meeting fees, and $4,760 was for employee related travel expense reimbursement. 

At September 30, 2016, the subordinated notes, all held by related parties had a balance of $65,000. Accrued interest payable
on the subordinated was approximately $18,000.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2016 the Company s
working capital was $(3,723) million. The financial resources of the Company will not provide sufficient funds for the Company s
operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2016, as those operations currently exist. Subsequent funding will be required to fund
the Company s ongoing operations, working capital, and capital expenditures beyond the fourth quarter of 2016. No assurances
can be given that the Company will be successful in arranging the further funds needed to continue the execution of its business
plan, which includes the development and commercialization of new products, or even if further funding is available, upon what
terms. Failure to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to the Company s management will require management to substantially
curtail, if not cease, operations, which will result in a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations
of the Company. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might occur if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Resignation of Auditor   

On October 11, 2016, the Company was advised
by its independent registered accounting firm, Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. ( Mayer Hoffman ), of its intention to not
seek re-appointment as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2016
and to cease serving as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm upon completion of the review of the
Company s unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Mayer Hoffman s reports on the financial
statements of the Company for each of the past two fiscal years have neither contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion,
nor been qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that, the reports included an explanatory
paragraph with respect to the uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. During the past two
fiscal years and in the subsequent interim period through October 11, 2016, there were (i) no disagreements with Mayer Hoffman
on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements,
if not resolved to the satisfaction of Mayer Hoffman, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements
in connection with its reports, and (ii) there were no reportable events (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K). 

Shareholder Approval Sought for Reverse Split  

On October 17, 2016, we filed a Definitive Proxy Statement
on Schedule 14A seeking approval from our shareholders for another reverse split of our common stock in a ratio of at
least 1-for-100 but not to exceed 1-for-400 (with the final ratio to be determined by our Board). The deadline for
shareholder approval of this reverse stock split was  November 14, 2016; however, as of November 9, 2016, we had not received
the requisite number of votes for a Quorum of shares under Delaware law to approve or not approve the reverse split proposal,
so we, have extended the solicitation period until November 30, 2016, at 5:00 pm EST. If our shareholders do not approve the
reverse split, we will be required to further seek approval consistent with our contractual obligations. Without this reverse
split  we are unable to provide additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon conversion notes issued in the
November 2015 private placement.

Business targets and objectives  

During 2015, our business objectives were aimed
at providing PbC batteries, electronics and systems to meet a variety of consumer and business needs. To achieve these objectives,
the overall business strategy includes collaborative working relationships that could allow the following to occur: 

Manufacture of batteries using our proprietary electrodes thereby allowing us to solely focus on the electrode manufacture   

Distribution of PbC batteries and product systems by established commercial organizations to allow shorter time to market   

Licensing of PbC products to established companies for use in their systems design and sale to broaden the acceptance of the technology   

Territorial intellectual property and applications licensing to facilitate global expansion and development of PbC uses beyond the capabilities of limited Axion resources   

Direct marketing and sale of batteries and systems with a very focused effort by Axion on discrete applications and markets.   

The nearer term market opportunities in 2015 were the non-vehicle
targets and significant work is in process to: 

Provide target markets with custom engineered solutions   

Leverage and potentially profitably grow this custom-focused business model   

Build and explore synergistic relationships within the customer and supplier spheres   

Explore and commercialize both market-wide and custom solutions, including new applications for PbC technology   

Use market feedback to improve and enhance PbC technology performance.   

Our plan to reach these objectives over 2016 is comprised of the
following: 

Complete restructuring and completion of combination of the Greenridge and Clover Lane facilities   

Complete ongoing cost cutting and efficiency increase measures   

Continue to identify and work with strategic partners to reach business objective   

Commence initiative to obtain corporate and brand identity and increase market awareness of technology and products through effective public relations and marketing campaign   

Identify discrete products with broad market demand utilizing the PbC technology such as a new generation residential energy storage system and a remote, off-grid lighting system.   

On February 2016, we initiated the following specific business strategies: 

Detailed and rigorous cost and expense management in order to maximize efficient use of our cash flow and create opportunities for business development   

Development of  value-added  strategic partnership plan with third parties, teaming agreements and joint ventures to derive business development and production opportunities with more established and better capitalized entities to develop business and production opportunities for our products   

Focused product applications development effort to better identify and capitalize upon application opportunities with a shorter  time to market  in order to identify near term commercial opportunities for marketing of our products   

Near term specific commercial opportunities to achieve prompt market placement of our products   

o  
      Micro off-grid   

o  
      Residential/commercial energy storage   

o  
      Frequency regulation such as PJM Interconnection   

o  
      Battery distribution network development for  stand alone  applications such as our dual battery street lamp application   

Development of new and comprehensive marketing plan with messaging, advertising and marketing communication of the  revised and revamped  Axion   

Comprehensive realignment of our personnel and corporate operations to implement our  act fast and be decisive  corporate philosophy   

We  continue to develop third party
PbC battery suppliers that could manufacture batteries using our PbC technology, and selling energy storage systems. We believe
that this streamlined effort with regard to our carbon negative electrode manufacturing, as well as consolidation of our facilities
and refocus of our business initiatives, will provide us with the best opportunity to commercialize our technology and thereby
provide the potential to improve our financial condition, cash flow and market presence. It is our primary goal to become the
leading supplier of carbon electrode assemblies for the global lead   acid battery industry. 

Net sales are derived from the sale of lead - acid batteries for specialty collector and racing cars; sales of AGM batteries and flooded lead- acid batteries: sales of PbC batteries and PbC energy storage components and devices and from the sales of products related to advanced battery applications for our PbC technology.   

Cost of tangible goods sold include raw materials, components, labor, and allocated manufacturing overhead to produce batteries and provide components for PbC energy storage devices and lead-acid batteries sold to customers. Cost of tangible goods sold represented in our current financial statements may not be indicative of the future costs to produce batteries and provide components for PbC energy storage devices. Also included in tangible cost of goods sold are provisions for inventory valuation and obsolescence reserves.   

Cost of goods sold   idle capacity includes direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to our finished goods in production. Operating costs include direct and indirect labor, production supplies, rent, insurance, property taxes, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Our charges for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined on a basis which is calculated presuming normal capacity utilization of two shifts a day, five days per week, which is lower than our actual production costs incurred. Operating costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather than to the cost of finished goods produced.   

Research and development expenses include expenses to design, develop and test advanced batteries, carbon electrode assemblies and systems for our energy storage products with prospective customers based on our patented lead carbon technology. Also included are materials consumed in the production of pilot plant production and our engineering activities.   

Selling, general and administrative expenses include business development, sales and marketing expenses; administrative expenses; and, expenses associated with being a public company.   

Board of Directors  

In January 2016, D. Walker Wainwright resigned
as a Director. Effective February 1, 2016, our board appointed Robert A. Maruszewski as a Director to take the seat vacated by
Mr. Wainwright. Mr. Maruszewski s appointment will serve until the formal shareholder election for board members to be held
at the Company s 2018 Annual Meeting. Stanley A. Hirschman was appointed as a Director and Audit Committee Chairman also
effective as of February 1, 2016. 

Effective as of February 1, 2016, Donald Farley
has resigned from responsibilities as interim CEO but shall remain as our Chairman and our Director. Also, effective as of February
1, 2016, Richard H. Bogan was appointed as our chief executive officer. 

Effective April 21, 2016, Stanley
Hirschman resigned as a director and chairman and member of the Audit Committee of Axion Power International, Inc. (the  Company )
due to his inability to devote the time and resources necessary to continue in his role as a director. On April 25, 2016, the
Company s Board of Directors appointed Richard Bogan, its Chief Executive Officer, as its Chairman in addition to being
its CEO, and Donald Farley, as its Vice Chairman. The Board also appointed Michael Kishinevsky as the interim chairman of its
Audit Committee.  

Effective
May 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of Axion Power International, Inc. appointed Michael J. Corcoran as a director to take
the seat vacated by Stanley Hirschman. Mr. Corcoran s appointment will serve until the next formal shareholder meeting. The Board also appointed Mr. Corcoran as the Chair
of its Audit Committee.  

Effective
as of September 2, 2016, Axion Power International, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into an employment contract with
Richard Bogan, its Chief Executive Officer pursuant to a written Executive Employment Agreement (the  Executive Employment
Agreement ). The following summarizes the material terms of the Employment Agreement:  

Mr. Bogan will receive an annual salary of $300,000 during the term of the Executive Employment Agreement;   

If Mr. Bogan s employment is terminated (i) other than  for
cause or for good reason , the Company shall pay him an aggregate severance amount equal to his base salary for the remainder
of the term of this employment agreement or one year, whichever is shorter but in no event less than six (6) months plus any accrued
and unused vacation for the current year and accrued but unpaid bonus if defined objectives have been achieved.    

The agreement also states that the Company will immediately and automatically
pay Mr. Bogan the sum of $600,000 upon a change in control, which is defined as (i) a transaction or series of related transactions
resulting in a 40% or greater change in ownership of the Company s equity on a fully diluted basis (other than as a result
of conversion of the senior convertible notes issued by the Company in November 2015); or (ii) a sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company (or consummation of a series of related transactions having the same effect).    

Mr. Bogan will receive stock options as determined by the Board of Directors upon receipt of consent from the investors in the November 2015 financing as required by the agreements entered into in connection therewith; and   

In connection with the Executive  Employment Agreement, Mr. Bogan signed an agreement regarding confidential information and non-competition (the  Non-Competition Agreement ) whereby Mr. Bogan and the Company agree, for a period of two years after the termination of Mr. Bogan s employment with the Company, that:   

Mr. Bogan will not render services to Conflicting Organizations
(as defined therein) or with respect to Conflicting Products (as defined therein) without written assurances to the Company
that such services will not be rendered in connection with any Conflicting Product; If, within one month after the termination
of Mr. Bogan s employment with the Company, he is unable to find employment due solely to the Non-Competition Agreement,
the provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement will continue in effect so long as the Company continues to pay Mr. Bogan an amount
equal to his base pay at the time of his termination (the  Termination Payments ). The Termination Payments will continue
for a period of 23 months or until the Company gives Mr. Bogan written permission to accept conflicting employment or a written
waiver of the provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement; and 

If, after the termination of Mr. Bogan s employment with the
Company, he accepts other employment but due solely to the Non-Competition Agreement his gross monthly income in such other employment
is less than his base pay at termination, the Company will pay Mr. Bogan the difference between his base pay at termination and
his gross monthly income in such other employment. 

Key Performance Indicators, Material Trends
and Uncertainties  

We utilize appropriate non-financial measures
to evaluate the performance of our research and development and engineering activities and projects with prospective customers.
Our demonstration projects entail extended periods of time to assess our energy devices over multiple charge and discharge cycles.
Further, the results of our demonstration projects do not lend themselves to simple measurement and presentation. 

The three most significant financial metrics
for our business are: 

Revenue growth of our PbC technologies.   

Extracting an acceptable and competitive level of operating profit from our revenue (as measured by EBITDA).   

Ensuring we have sufficient capital to fund our short and long-term business requirements.   

We will continue to characterize and perfect
our PbC products through working with targeted prospective customers in a number of projects as we move into commercialization.
While we are working toward successful commercialization of our PbC products, we cannot provide assurances that the PbC products
will be successful in their present design or that further research and development will not be needed. The successful completion
of present and future characterization and demonstration projects is critical to the development and acceptance of our PbC
technology. 

We must continue to improve methodologies for
manufacturing carbon electrode assemblies for our energy storage devices in commercial quantities. While we have assembled an engineering
team that we believe can accomplish this goal, and are adding to it as we go forward, there is no assurance that we will be able
to successfully commercialize our PbC products in large quantities. 

Results of Operations  

Summarized selected financial data for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA 

Summarized selected financial data for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA 

(1)       EBITDA,
a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as earnings before interest expense and interest income, taxes, depreciation, amortization,
share based compensation, derivative revaluations, and impairment of assets.  EBITDA is used by management to internally measure
our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our
business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information
that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 

Summary of Consolidated Income for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 (in thousands)   

Net Sales   

Net sales for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $5 compared to $167 for the same period in 2015. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $36
compared to $511 for the same period in 2015. We had one customer that accounted for approximately 87% of sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to three customers that accounted for approximately 68% of net sales for nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Sales declined due the Company s decision to discontinue the manufacturing and sales of lead-acid batteries
and focus on the continued development of its PbC technology. 

Cost of Tangible Goods Sold   

The costs of tangible goods sold for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 were $(4) compared to $233 for the same period in 2015. Cost of goods sold for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 were $186, which included and inventory revaluation of $168, compared to $639 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 which included an inventory revaluation of $111,500. Cost of goods sold declined for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to a reduced sales as well as the write off of expired warranty costs. 

Cost of Goods Sold  Idle Capacity   

The costs of goods sold-idle capacity for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $256 compared to $399 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The cost of goods
sold idle-capacity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $871 and $1,344 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease in cost of goods sold idle-capacity, resulted primarily from decreased headcount and fixed expenses as well as labor
due to decreased manufacturing. 

Gross Loss   

Gross loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $247 compared to $466 for the same period in 2015. Gross loss for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was $1,021 compared to $1,473 for the same period in 2015. The variance in gross loss for both the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 is due primarily to the headcount reductions mentioned above as well as decreased revenue, decreased
cost of goods sold and decreased cost of idle capacity. 

Research and Development Expenses   

Research and development expense was $131 compared
to $219 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 were $474 compared to $719 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expense
was due to reduced headcount and reduced inventory use for testing.

Senior Convertible Notes   

The Company paid a
premium in the amount of $165 related to the cash pay down on the senior convertible notes for both the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. There was no premium paid for the same period in 2015. 

Interest Expense on Convertible Notes   

The Company recognized interest expense of
$161 on the senior convertible notes during the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September
30, 2015 there was $1 of interest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there was $703 recognized for interest
expense on the senior convertible notes. Of that, $229 was paid in cash while the $444 in was paid through stock conversions. For
the same period in 2015, the Company recorded $4 in interest expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   (In Thousands)  

Our sources of liquidity have historically
been cash generated from issuances of our equity and debt securities. From inception through September 30, 2016, we have generated
revenue from operations that was not significant enough to produce an operating profit. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company s
working capital was $ (3,723). The financial resources of the Company will not provide sufficient funds for the Company s
operations beyond the fourth quarter 2016, as those operations currently exist. Subsequent funding will be required to fund the
Company s ongoing operations, working capital, and capital expenditures beyond the fourth quarter 2016. No assurances can
be given that the Company will be successful in arranging the further funds needed to continue the execution of its business plan,
which includes the development and commercialization of new products, or even if further funding is available, upon what terms.
Failure to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to the Company s management will require management to substantially curtail,
if not cease, operations, which will result in a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of
the Company. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might occur if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Working Capital  

At September 30, 2016 working capital was $
(3,723) compared to $61 at December 31, 2015. 

Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities  

Net cash used in operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $3,622 consisting of net cash used by operations of $4,094 offset by $472 provided by changes in operating
assets and liabilities. Net cash used by operations for the same period of 2015 was $3,553 of which $4,004 was used to fund the
operation of the business offset by $451 which was provided by operating assets and liabilities. 

Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities  

Net provided by financing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, was $2,919 compared to net cash provided of $434 for the same period in 2015. Cash provided in
2016 was from the release of restricted cash of $6,539 offset by repayment short term debt of $3,620. For 2015, net cash provided
was $510 in proceeds from Convertible Bridge Notes with $76 being used to repay short term debt. 

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities  

Cash used in investing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $(3) compared to no cash used for the same period in 2015. 

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments
and Estimates  

Our significant accounting policies are fundamental
to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies require that we use estimates and
assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. These policies are described in  Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates  and Note 2 (Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the first nine months ending September 30, 2016, there have been no modifications
to our Accounting Policies as defined in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, an effect on our financial statements. 

ITEM
                          4.      CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the period covered by our
quarterly report, management performed, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our Principal Executive
Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this report. 

There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER
INFORMATION  

ITEM
                          1.      LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS   

From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits,
claims, investigations and proceedings, including pending opposition proceedings involving patents that arise in the ordinary course
of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows. 

ITEM
                          1A.      RISK
FACTORS   

There is no change to the risk factors disclosed
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 except as set forth below: 

As a result of our November 2015 financing,
we have experienced and continue to experience significant dilution to our stock both in the number of shares being issued and
continued decline in our stock price.   

Reducing the number of outstanding
shares of our common stock through the reverse stock split is intended, absent other factors, to increase the per share
market price of our common stock. However, other factors, such as our financial results, general market conditions and the
market perception of our company, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the reverse stock split, if completed, will result in the intended benefits described above, that the market
price of our common stock will increase following the reverse stock split or that the market price of our common stock will
not decrease in the future. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the market price per share of our common stock after
a reverse stock split will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock
outstanding before the reverse stock split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock after the
reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split. Our third reverse stock
split with a 1:400 ratio was effected on July 15, 2016, which was approved by the shareholders on June 27, 2016 as a result
of the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company on May 25, 2016. The Company listed as its primary
goal raising the stock price to the $1 to $3 range and providing sufficient authorized and unissued shares to satisfy
its obligations with respect to the November 2015 Notes. While it was temporarily successful, as a result of continued
conversions of these Notes pursuant to the terms of these Notes (which calls for the conversion price to be set at 75% of the
then current market price), the stock price quickly decreased and is now less than $0.02, thus necessitating the currently
proposed reverse stock split. As of November 10, 2016 we did not have sufficient shares of stock voted in order to approve or
not approve the reverse stock split, so we have extended the period of the solicitation until November 30, 2016. If the
reverse split does not gain approval, we are contractually required to again seek approval, which we may not receive. While
we will attempt to work out an alternative resolution with the investors, we cannot assure you if we will be able to do so or
upon what terms. We cannot assure you that  the currently proposed reverse stock split will not result in dilution of the
magnitude experienced as a result of the July 2016 stock split.
