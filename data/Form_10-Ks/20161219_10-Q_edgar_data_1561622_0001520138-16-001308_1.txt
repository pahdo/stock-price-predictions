Note
1 - Description of Business   

On December 22, 2015, the Company
entered into a Licensing Agreement with Labor Smart, Inc., a stockholder of the Company, whereby Labor Smart, Inc. has granted
the Company an exclusive license to use their trademarked name in connection with general advertising materials, point of sale
displays and other promotional materials. As consideration for the use of the trademarked name, the Company agreed to pay to Labor
Smart, Inc. a one-time fee of $5,000 for each newly opened branch location that is opened under the name of Labor Smart, Inc. 

On December 28, 2015, the Company
incorporated a subsidiary, Staff Fund I, LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company. 

On December 31, 2015, the
Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with Pour Les Enfant, LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company
( Pour Les Enfant ). Pursuant to the SPA, the Company, as sole shareholder of EmployUS, Ltd. completed the split-off
by transferring to Pour Les Enfant all outstanding shares and tangible assets of EmployUS, Ltd. (the  split-off transaction ).
In consideration thereof, Pour Les Enfant assumed all liabilities of EmployUS, Ltd. associated with monies owed to the Internal
Revenue Service for late payroll taxes; and all corporate, personal, and validity guarantees associated the Crestmark Bank Loan
and Security Agreement. Pursuant to the SPA, Brent Callais and Brian McLoone, directors, executives and controlling shareholders
of the Company, each agreed to transfer to the Company 91,000 shares of the Company s common stock and one share of the Company s
preferred stock, for immediate cancellation. As a result of the cancellation of the two (2) preferred shares by Brent Callais and
Brian McLoone, there was a change in control of the Company as Labor Smart, Inc. holds the one (1) remaining outstanding preferred
share of the Company. 

The financial results of
EmployUS, Ltd. qualifies for reporting as a discontinued operations. A substantial portion of the Company s 2015 financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the reporting of discontinued operations adopted in 2015. See Note 5. 

In January 2016, the Company commenced
operations of one (1) staffing location Montgomery, Alabama through the subsidiary, Staff Fund I, LLC. This subsidiary operates
under a licensing agreement with Labor Smart, Inc. Staff Fund I, LLC recruits, hires, employs and manages skilled and unskilled
workers that it places with its client companies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Staff Fund I, LLC issued membership
interests for cash proceeds of $14,000. At September 30, 2016, 7% of Staff Fund I, LLC s membership interest are held by
non-controlling interest. 

On April 1, 2016, the Company purchased
the operating assets of four (4) branch locations in Charlotte, NC, Indianapolis, IN, Nashville, TN and Raleigh, NC from Labor
Smart, Inc. for consideration with a fair value of $2,666,000. The one-time fee of $5,000 for the (4) newly opened branches which
were opened under the Labor Smart, Inc. name totaling $20,000 was waived. As a requirement of the purchase of the operating assets,
the one (1) issued and outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock owed by Labor Smart, Inc. was transferred to Kimberly Thompson,
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company in addition the CEO stepped down from any former position she held with Labor Smart,
Inc. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock gives the holder voting rights equal to 2 votes for every one share of common stock
outstanding at the time of a vote of shareholders and does not have any additional rights or preferences. As such, at September
30, 2016, Kimberly Thompson controlled the majority of shareholder votes. (See Note 3).

Note 2 - Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of presentation    

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Article
8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for any subsequent quarter of for the year ending December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 13, 2016 for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

principles
of consolidation    

The condensed consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company s one operating subsidiary.  All significant inter-company
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates    

The preparation of condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant matters requiring the use of estimates and assumptions
include, but may not be limited to, accounts receivable allowances, goodwill, intangible assets, valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets and valuation of derivative liabilities. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based
on information that is available at the time they are made. 

Revenue
Recognition    

Contract staffing service revenues
are recognized when services are rendered. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 605  Revenue Recognition , which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be
recognized: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is
reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been rendered. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The Company considers highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased as cash equivalents. At times throughout the year,
the Company might maintain bank balances that may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured limits. Periodically,
the Company evaluates the credit worthiness of the financial institutions, and has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

Cash
- Restricted    

Restricted cash represents
cash in a lockbox account by held by TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP in accordance with the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. The Company considered $11,953, as restricted cash at September 30, 2016. No cash was considered restricted at December
31, 2015. (See Note 8) 

Accounts
Receivable    

The Company extends credit to its
customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and ability to pay the Company in accordance with
the payment terms. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to bad debt expense where collection is considered
doubtful due to credit issues. This allowance reflects management s estimate of the potential losses inherent in the accounts
receivable balance, based on historical loss statistics and known factors impacting its customers. The nature of the contract service
business, where companies are dependent on employees for their production cycle, generally results in a nominal provision for doubtful
accounts. Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts was not material for any
of the periods presented. The Company charges uncollectible accounts against the allowance once the invoices are deemed unlikely
to be collectible. The Company does not accrue interest on past due receivables. 

Net
(Loss) Income per Common Share    

Net (loss) income per common
share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Basic net (loss) income
per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period.  Diluted net (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company excluded 3,686,245 and 151,963 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of convertible notes payable and Series B Stock, respectively, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

Identifiable
Intangible Assets    

Identifiable intangible assets
consist primarily of customer relationships and non-compete contracts. These assets are tested for impairment using discounted
cash flow methodology annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator. Estimating future cash flows requires significant
judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Several impairment indicators are beyond the Company s
control, and determining whether or not they will occur cannot be predicted with any certainty. Customer relationships and non-compete
contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of five years.

Goodwill    

Goodwill represents the premium
paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Company s business combinations.
The Company performs a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis at the reporting unit level. Application of the goodwill
impairment test requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts,
estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination
of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of
fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will conduct its annual goodwill impairment
test as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company periodically analyzes whether
any such indicators of impairment exist. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment
has occurred. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant
adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition and/or slower expected growth rates, adverse
actions or assessments by a regulator, among others. The Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its respective
carrying value, including related goodwill. Future changes in the industry could impact the results of future annual impairment
tests. There can be no assurance that future tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges. 

Fair
Value Measurement    

As required by the Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC ( ASC 820-10 ), fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly
or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions. 

The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1  
      Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;    

Level 2  
      Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;    

Level 3  
      Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).    

Convertible promissory notes
payable and convertible promissory note derivative liability   related party is measured at fair value on a recurring basis
using Level 3 inputs. 

The carrying amounts reported in
the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and
accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the immediate or short-term nature of these consolidated financial instruments.
The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for its line of credit and convertible notes payable
approximates fair value as the contractual interest rate and features are consistent with similar instruments of similar risk in
the market place.

Convertible
Promissory Notes   

i)     Beneficial Conversion Feature     

 If the conversion features
of conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value, this feature is characterized as
a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic
470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options.  In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded
net of the discount related to the BCF and the Company amortizes the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using
the effective interest method. 

ii)     Debt Discount     

 The Company determines if
the convertible debenture should be accounted for as a liability or equity under ASC 480, Liabilities   Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity. ASC 480, applies to certain contracts involving a Company's own equity, and requires that issuers classify the following
freestanding financial instruments as liabilities. Mandatorily redeemable financial instruments, obligations that require or may
require repurchase of the issuer's equity shares by transferring assets (e.g., written put options and forward purchase contracts),
and certain obligations where at inception the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on: 

   A fixed monetary
amount known at inception, for example, a payable settleable with a variable number of the issuer's equity shares with an issuance
date fair value equal to a fixed dollar amount, 

   Variations in something
other than the fair value of the issuer's equity shares, for example, a financial instrument indexed to the S P 500 and settleable
with a variable number of the issuer's equity shares, or 

   Variations inversely
related to changes in the fair value of the issuer's equity shares, for example, a written put that could be net share settled. 

 If the entity determined
the instrument meets the guidance under ASC 480 the instrument is accounted for as a liability with a respective debt discount.
The Company records debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of convertible debt. These costs are amortized
to non-cash interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of
the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. 

iii)   Derivative Financial Instruments    

 Derivative financial instruments,
as defined in ASC 815,  Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities , consist of financial
instruments or other contracts that contain a notional amount and one or more underlying (e.g. interest rate, security price or
other variable), require no initial net investment and permit net settlement. Derivative financial instruments may be free-standing
or embedded in other financial instruments. Further, derivative financial instruments are initially, and subsequently, measured
at fair value and recorded as liabilities or, in rare instances, assets. 

The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow, market or foreign-currency risks. However, the Company has issued
financial instruments including senior convertible promissory notes payable and freestanding stock purchase warrants with features
that are either (i) not afforded equity classification, (ii) embody risks not clearly and closely related to host contracts, or
(iii) may be net-cash settled by the counterparty. As required by ASC 815, in certain instances, these instruments are required
to be carried as derivative liabilities, at fair value, in our consolidated financial statements.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements     

In April 2015, the FASB issued
a new accounting standard which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under the new standard,
an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.
Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2015 and was adopted in the first quarter of 2016. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued
a new accounting standard which is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based compensation. This standard simplifies the
accounting for income taxes in relation to share-based compensation, modifies the accounting for forfeitures, and modifies the
statutory tax withholding requirements. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the new accounting standard
will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-10 ( ASU 2016-10 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing.  ASU 2016-10 will affect all entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods
or services (that are an output of the entity s ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration.  The amendments
in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective, the amendments in this update clarify the following
two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related
principles for those areas. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are effective in the
annual period ending December 31, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect that ASU 2016-10 will have on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-12 ( ASU 2016-12 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients.  ASU 2016-12 will affect all entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods
or services (that are an output of the entity s ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration.  The amendments
in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective, the amendments in this update affect narrow aspects
of Topic 606 including among others: assessing collectability criterion, noncash consideration, and presentation of sales taxes
and other similar taxes collected from customers. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update
are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-10. The Company is currently evaluating the effect
that ASU 2016-12 will have on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

In August 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 is intended to address how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified
in the statement of cash flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing
diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have
on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

Unaudited pro forma results
of operations information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as if the Company and the entities described above
had been combined on January 1, 2015 are as follows. The pro forma results include estimates and assumptions which management believes
are reasonable. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of
these entities, and are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the business combinations had been
in effect on the dates indicated, or which may result in the future. 

Revenue and costs are generally
allocated using specific identification and include corporate administrative expenses, finance, legal, tax, treasury and other
general corporate services. 

The carve-out financial information
include revenue and expenses of Labor Smart, Inc., allocated to the 

 Four Branches ( Predecessor )
for certain functions provided by Labor Smart, including compensation and benefits, occupancy, information technology costs, finance
and interest costs, legal, tax, treasury and other general corporate services. These expenses have been allocated to the results
of the Four Branches based on one of four allocation cost drivers: 

  1)        
  Revenues attributable to the Four Branches,   

  2)        
  The headcount of employees within the Four Branches and Labor Smart  

  3)        
  The identification of costs specific to the Four Branches; and  

  4)        
  Allocation of finance and interest costs based on proceeds from the sales of the Four Branches
by Labor Smart.  

Management considers the
basis on which the expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or the
benefit received by, the Four Branches, The allocations may not; however, reflect the expenses the Four Branches would have incurred
as an independent entity for the periods presented. 

Unaudited predecessor financial
information has been provided in these condensed consolidated financial statements as the Company acquired the Four Branches and
the operations of the Company before the acquisition of the Four Branches were insignificant relative to the operations acquired.

Note
4 - Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $1,779,775
and a working capital deficit of $3,764,394. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company had a net loss of $2,643,936.
The Company s stockholders  deficiency is primarily due to, among other reasons, funding its historical net losses. 

The Company s principal sources
of liquidity include cash from operations and proceeds from debt and equity financings. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
$209,048 in cash. 

The Company is funding its operations
primarily through the sale of equity, convertible notes payable and shareholder loans. In the event the Company experiences liquidity
and capital resources constraints because of greater than anticipated sales growth or acquisition needs, the Company may need to
raise additional capital in the form of equity and/or debt financing including refinancing its current debt. Issuances of additional
shares will result in dilution to its existing shareholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional
sales of its equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund any potential acquisition needs or increased growth.
If such additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, then the Company may need to curtail
its operations and/or take additional measures to conserve and manage its liquidity and capital resources, any of which would have
a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The ability to successfully resolve these
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements
of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties. In order
to mitigate the risk related with this uncertainty, the Company plans to issue additional shares of common stock for cash and services
during the next 12 months.

those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Risk

Overview  

We were originally incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada on June 11, 2012 under the name Aviana, Corp.  Our original business was a Poland based corporation
that operated a consulting business in EMF (electromagnetic fields). 

EmployUS, LLC ( EmployUS ) a Delaware
Limited Liability Company, was formed on September 30, 2010 having a perpetual existence and was a full service turnkey staffing
company. Effective July 1, 2013, EmployUS, changed its corporate status from a limited liability company to a  C  corporation
and its state of registration from Delaware to Nevada. As a result of these changes, the new name of EmployUS became EmployUS,
Ltd. ( EmployUS, Ltd. ). 

On January 22, 2014, The Staffing Group, Ltd.
( the Company ) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with EmployUS,
Ltd., all of the stockholders of EmployUS, Ltd. (the  EmployUS, Ltd. Shareholders ), and the Company s controlling
stockholders. Upon closing of the Exchange Agreement, EmployUS, Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Exchange
Agreement was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization and EmployUS, Ltd. was deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse
merger for accounting purposes and the Company was deemed the legal acquirer. The Company therefore, took on EmployUS, Ltd. s
operating history. 

On November 13, 2015, the Board of Directors
approved the issuance of two (2) shares of Series A Preferred Stock to each of its current directors, at that time, Brian McLoone

Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Information   

 In addition to the United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) results, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q also includes certain non-GAAP
financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company defines EBITDA as loss from continuing
operations, plus interest expense net of interest income, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The
Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as these items plus change in fair value of derivative liabilities, pretax.  EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA are measures used by management to evaluate ongoing operations and as a general indicator of its operating cash
flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement that also includes, among other items, changes in working capital and the effect
of non-cash charges). Management believes these measurements are useful to investors because they are frequently used by securities
analysts, investors and other interested parties in the comparative evaluation of companies. Because not all companies use identical
calculations, the Company s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
of other companies.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP, do not purport to be alternatives
to, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, net income (loss) as a measure of operating
performance or to cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure
of liquidity.  Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management s
discretionary use as they do not reflect certain cash requirements, such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements.

complete trading day prior to the conversion date. The Company may repay the Note if repaid within 120 days of date of issue at
125% of the original principal amount plus interest, between 121 days and 150 days at 130% of the original principal amount plus

Convertible Notes Payable  

 On March 29, 2016, with an effective

Islands limited partnership ( TCA ), pursuant to which TCA agreed to loan up to a maximum of three million dollars
($3,000,000) to us for working capital purposes. A total of $1,300,000 was funded by TCA in connection with the closing of the
Agreement. The amounts borrowed pursuant to the Credit Agreement are evidenced by a Senior Secured Revolving Convertible Promissory
Note (the  Revolving Note ), the repayment of which is secured by Security Agreements executed by us and our subsidiary,
The Staff Fund I, LLC. Pursuant to the Security Agreements, the repayment of the Revolving Note is secured by a security interest
in substantially all of our assets in favor of TCA. The initial Revolving Note in the amount of $1,300,000 is due and payable along
with interest thereon on October 5, 2016, and bears interest at the minimum rate of 12% per annum, increasing to 22% per annum

to convert all or any portion of the Revolving Note into shares of the Company s common stock. The conversion rate shall
be 85% of the lowest VWAP of the Company s stock for the five days preceding the conversion date. The Credit Agreement provides
for certain contractual rights to TCA. TCA has influence and veto power over key decisions which effect operating, investing and
financing activities of the Company including the right to approve the transfer agent, maintenance of insurance, approve the selection
of management after performing background investigations, approve all capital expenditures, approve issuance of stock, approve
opening new bank accounts and approve change in control of the Company.  The Credit Agreement also provides that all cash
receipts from customers are required to be deposited in a lock box account. Distributions from the lock box account are made to
the Company only after obligations to TCA are satisfied. TCA with absolute discretion may withhold cash in the lock box in order
to protect collateral. During the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid $304,237 in cash for principal and $104,689
for interest and fees. At September 30, 2016, the Note includes principal of $995,763 and accrued interest of $256,846 less unamortized
debt discount of $28,572.

Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with an effective date of April 5, 2016, for not

Going Concern  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $1,779,775 and a working
capital deficit of $3,764,394. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $2,643,936. The Company s
stockholders  deficiency is primarily due to, among other reasons, funding its historical costs. 

The Company s principal sources of liquidity
include cash from operations and proceeds from debt and equity financings. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $209,048 in
cash. 

The Company is funding its operations primarily
through the sale of equity, convertible notes payable and shareholder loans. In the event the Company experiences liquidity and
capital resources constraints because of greater than anticipated sales growth or acquisition needs, the Company may need to raise
additional capital in the form of equity and/or debt financing including refinancing its current debt. Issuances of additional
shares will result in dilution to its existing shareholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional
sales of its equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund any potential acquisition needs or increased growth.
If such additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, then the Company may need to curtail
its operations and/or take additional measures to conserve and manage its liquidity and capital resources, any of which would have
a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The ability to successfully resolve these
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements
of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties. In order
to mitigate the risk related with this uncertainty, the Company plans to issue additional shares of common stock for cash and services

2016 Outlook  

On December 31, 2015, we refocused our
growth strategy. Going forward, we intend to focus on strategic growth acquisitions. As a result of the split-off transactions
on December 31, 2015, we believe that the likelihood of successful acquisitions has increased as significant liabilities have been
derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet. 

Our goal in 2016 was to complete a platform
acquisition for a number of branch offices with Labor Smart, Inc., our controlling shareholder. Thereafter, we plan to continue
to grow by way of acquisition of additional branch offices. We will also seek to fully grow and develop new branch locations under
the licensing agreement with Labor Smart, Inc. We currently operate one branch location under the license agreement. 

Due to increased regulations, rising
state unemployment insurance rates that are required to be paid by businesses, rising workers insurance compensation rates and
uncertainty regarding the Affordable Care Act, we believe that small staffing companies are prime for acquisition. 

In order to successfully complete our
growth plan as outlined in the 2016 outlook, we anticipate using cash from operations to continue to fund our business operations
and as the Company implements its planned expansion throughout the Southeast U.S. As we will open additional branches under the
licensing agreement we expect to incorporate a new company each time we open a new branch. The startup capital for each branch
is expected to be raised by crowdfunding with new investor ownership limited to 49% of each branch. 

In the event that we need to access
the capital markets and sell equity in order to fund operations or further our growth strategy, issuances of additional shares
will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity
securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned activities.  

We expect that working capital requirements will continue
to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP )
requires our management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto,
and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant
to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our
financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal
of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent
periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because
of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s current judgments.
We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements. 

The condensed consolidated financial
statements include all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Staffing Group, Ltd. for the periods presented. The results of operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of operating results expected for future periods. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant matters requiring the use of estimates and assumptions
include, but may not be limited to, accounts receivable allowances, evaluation of impairment of long lived assets, valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets and valuation of derivative liabilities. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable,
based on information that is available at the time they are made. 

Revenue Recognition  

Contract staffing service revenues are
recognized when services are rendered. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
605  Revenue Recognition , which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) persuasive
evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonable assured; and (iv)
services have been rendered.

Convertible Promissory Notes  

i)     Beneficial Conversion Feature     

 If the conversion features
of conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value, this feature is characterized as
a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic
470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options.  In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded
net of the discount related to the BCF and the Company amortizes the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using
the effective interest method. 

ii)     Debt Discount     

 The Company determines if
the convertible debenture should be accounted for as liability or equity under ASC 480, Liabilities   Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity. ASC 480, applies to certain contracts involving a company's own equity, and requires that issuers classify the following
freestanding financial instruments as liabilities. Mandatorily redeemable financial instruments, obligations that require or may
require repurchase of the issuer's equity shares by transferring assets (e.g., written put options and forward purchase contracts),
and certain obligations where at inception the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on: 

   A fixed monetary amount
known at inception, for example, a payable settleable with a variable number of the issuer's equity shares with an issuance date
fair value equal to a fixed dollar amount, 

   Variations in something
other than the fair value of the issuer's equity shares, for example, a financial instrument indexed to the S P 500 and settleable
with a variable number of the issuer's equity shares, or 

   Variations inversely
related to changes in the fair value of the issuer's equity shares, for example, a written put that could be net share settled. 

 If the entity determined the
instrument meets the guidance under ASC 480 the instrument is accounted for as a liability with a respective debt discount. The
Company records debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of convertible debt. These costs are amortized
to non-cash interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of
the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. 

iii)   Derivative Financial Instruments    

 Derivative financial instruments,
as defined in ASC 815,  Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities , consist of financial
instruments or other contracts that contain a notional amount and one or more underlying (e.g. interest rate, security price or
other variable), require no initial net investment and permit net settlement. Derivative financial instruments may be free-standing
or embedded in other financial instruments. Further, derivative financial instruments are initially, and subsequently, measured
at fair value and recorded as liabilities or, in rare instances, assets. 

The Company does not use derivative
financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow, market or foreign-currency risks. However, the Company has issued financial
instruments including senior convertible promissory notes payable and freestanding stock purchase warrants with features that are
either (i) not afforded equity classification, (ii) embody risks not clearly and closely related to host contracts, or (iii) may
be net-cash settled by the counterparty. As required by ASC 815, in certain instances, these instruments are required to be carried
as derivative liabilities, at fair value, in our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

We maintain  disclosure controls
and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally,
in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

With respect to the quarterly period
ended September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our management
has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 due to our limited internal
resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. In connection with this evaluation, management identified
the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of September 30, 2016: 

(1)  
      Lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and   

(2)  
      Inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives of having segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions and the custody of assets; and     

(3)  
      We have not conducted a formal assessment of whether the policies that have been implemented address the specific risks of misstatement, due to the change in control; and   

(4)  
      We do not have not have a fully effective mechanism for monitoring the system of internal controls.   

However, to the extent possible, we
will implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
will be performed by separate individuals. We also plan to improve the effectiveness of the accounting group by continuing to augment
our existing resources with additional consultants or employees to improve segregation procedures and to assist in the analysis
and recording of complex accounting transactions. We plan to hire additional senior accounting personnel or additional independent
consultants once we generate significantly more revenue or raise significant additional working capital.  We will also improve
segregation procedures by strengthening cross approval of various functions including quarterly internal audit procedures where
appropriate. We believe that the foregoing steps will remediate the material weaknesses identified above, and we will continue
to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. 

Management is in the process of determining
how best to change our current system and implement a more effective system to insure that information required to be disclosed
in required periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported
accurately. Our management acknowledges the existence of this problem, and intends to developed procedures to address them to the
extent possible given limitations in financial and manpower resources. While management is working on a plan, no assurance can
be made at this point that the implementation of such controls and procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they
will be adequate once implemented. 

Changes in Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting .   

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
