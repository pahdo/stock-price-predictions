NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Basis of presentation, significant concentrations and risks

(a) Basis of presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of China XD Plastics Company Limited ("China XD") and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows and related notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year then ended, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.

In the opinion of the management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the financial position as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been made.

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the recoverability of the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, the realizability of inventories, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, the collectability of accounts receivable, the fair values of stock-based compensation awards, and the accruals for tax uncertainties and other contingencies. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions.

(b) Significant concentrations and risks

Sales concentration

The Company sells its products primarily through approved distributors in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC"). To a lesser extent, the Company also sells its products to an overseas customer in the Republic of Korea (the "ROK"). The Company's sales are highly concentrated.  Sales to distributors and end customer, which individually exceeded 10% of the Company's revenues for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are as follows: 

6 

The Company expects revenues from these distributors and an end customer to continue to represent a substantial portion of its revenue in the future. Any factor adversely affecting the automobile industry in the PRC, electronic application industry in the ROK or the business operations of these customers will have a material effect on the Company's business, financial position and results of operations.

Purchase concentration of raw materials and equipment

The principal raw materials used for the Company's production of modified plastics products are plastic resins, such as polypropylene, ABS and nylon. The Company purchased its raw materials through a limited number of distributors, which individually exceeded 10% of the Company's total raw material purchases, accounted for approximately 62.5% (five distributors)  and 88.3% (seven distributors) of the Company's total raw materials purchases for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 68.1% (five distributors) and 86.7% (seven distributors) of the Company's total raw materials purchases for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Management believes that other suppliers could provide similar raw materials on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales, which would adversely affect the Company's business, financial position and results of operations.

The Company purchased equipment from two major equipment distributors, which accounted for 0% and 96.0% of the Company's total equipment purchases for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and accounted for 96.0% and 97.2% of the Company's total equipment purchases for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Management believes that other suppliers could provide similar equipment on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales, which would adversely affect the Company's business, financial position and results of operations.  The majority owner of one of the major equipment distributors, is also the majority owner of Distributor E presented above.

7 

Cash concentration

Upon maturity and repayment of the bills payable, which is generally within 6 months, the cash becomes available for use by the Company. The cash will be available for use by the Company 90 days from the issuance of the letter of credit. The cash flows from the pledged bank deposits, which relate to purchases of raw materials, are reported within cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

Short-term bank deposits that are pledged as collateral for short-term and long-term bank borrowings are reported as restricted cash and amounted to US$54,256,789 and US$32,010,452 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits, accounts receivable, amounts due from a related party, short-term bank loans, bills payable, accounts payable, amounts due to related parties, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities - carrying amounts approximate fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.

Long-term bank loans-fair value is based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each loan discounted at the Company's current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable terms. The carrying value of the long-term bank loans approximate their fair values as the long-term bank loans carry interest rates which approximate rates currently offered by the Company's banks for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.

Pursuant to an approval from the local tax authority in July 2013, Sichuan Xinda, a subsidiary of China XD, became a qualified enterprise located in the western region of the PRC, which entitled it to a preferential income tax rate of 15% from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2020. Under the current laws of Dubai, AL Composites Materials FZE ("AL Composites"), a subsidiary of China XD, is exempted from income taxes.

The effective income tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 18.9% and 17.3%, respectively.  The effective income tax rate increased from 17.3% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 to 18.9% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the mix of profits in different entities and the effect of loss on senior notes redemption. The effective income tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 differs from the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% primarily due to the effect of the preferential tax rate of Sichuan Xinda, the tax rate differential on entities not subject to PRC income tax, super deduction of R D expense and partially offset by the effect of non-deductible expenses.

As of September 30, 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits were US$26,167,182 and the interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits was US$5,110,115.  No penalties expense related to unrecognized tax benefits were recorded. The Company is currently unable to provide an estimate of a range of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible to change significantly within the next twelve months.

Note 20   Recently issued accounting pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"), which modified lease accounting for both lessees and lessors to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting standards and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"), which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addressed and provided guidance for each of eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This standard will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This standard required that companies recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset (other than inventory) when the transfer occurs. Current guidance prohibits companies from recognizing current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. This standard will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company's products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of more than 28 automobile brands and 80 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Buick, Chevrolet, VW Passat, Golf and Jetta, Mazda, and Toyota. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics, and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. As of September 30, 2016, in domestic market, we had approximately 390,000 metric tons of production capacity across 84 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwanese conveyer systems. In December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, expecting to bring total domestic installed production capacity to 690,000 metric tons with additional 70 new production lines at the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has supplied to its customers since 2013, mainly backed by production capacity in our Harbin production plant. We installed 50 production lines with production capacity of 60,000 metric tons in the second half year of 2016 in our Sichuan plant as of September 30, 2016. There is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant to be expected to be completed by the end of 2016. In addition, we completed the trial production in the plant in Dubai, UAE with additional 2,500 metric tons of production capacity ("Phase 1") targeting high-end products for the overseas markets. In order to meet the increasing demand from our customer in the ROK and to develop potential overseas markets, on January 25, 2015, AL Composites Materials FZE ("AL Composites") obtained a leased property of approximately 10,000 square meters from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority ("JAFZA") in Dubai, UAE with constructed building comprising a warehouse, office and service block with a lease term of 15 years.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, statements of income data in millions of USD:

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015

Revenues

Revenues were US$331.8 million in the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, an increase of US$92.7 million, or 38.8%, compared to US$239.1 million in the same period of last year, due to 33.0% increase in sales volume and 10.0% increase in the average RMB selling price of our products offset by approximately 6.0% negative impact from exchange rate due to weakening RMB against US dollars.

In order to stimulate the growth of the auto industry, on September 29, 2015, the Chinese government implemented a tax incentive policy of 50% reduction of the sales tax for eligible purchase of vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters and less.  This helped the recovery of vehicle sales in China since the fourth quarter of 2015.  Passenger vehicles production increased by 14.7% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of the prior year. The Company has been actively marketing its higher-end products to customers to better allocate its production capacity, diversifying its business to reduce its concentration in the Chinese market. Driven by accelerating growth of 133.3% in Central China and 300.3% in South China, domestic sales during the third quarter of 2016 increased by 27.2% as compared to the same period of the prior year.

Oversea sales was US$37.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to US$7.3 million in the same period of the prior year due to the supply to a ROK customer in the third quarter of 2016. The ROK customer has made payment of US$5.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 with an outstanding balance of US$58.3 million, among which balance of US$34.9 million was overdue as of September 30, 2016.  The overdue payment was due to the ROK customer's expansion and tight funding. The management has taken actions to obtain undertaking from the ROK customer to make the payment in early December, 2016

The following table summarizes the breakdown of metric tons (MT) by product mix:

24 

The Company continued to shift production mix from traditional Modified Polypropylene (PP) to higher-end products such as PA66, PA6, Plastic Alloy and POM, primarily due to (i) the greater growth potential of advanced modified plastics in luxury automobile models in China, (ii) the stronger demand as a result of promotion by the Chinese government for clean energy vehicles and (iii) better quality from end consumer recognition of higher-end cars made by automotive manufacturers from Chinese and Germany joint ventures, and U.S. and Japanese joint ventures, which manufacturers tend to use more and higher-end modified plastics in quantity per vehicle in China.

Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit was US$69.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016   compared to US$29.3 million in the same period of 2015, representing an increase of 137.5%. Our gross margin increased to 21.0% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from 12.3% during the same quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher contribution from our higher-margin products sold overseas. 

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative (G A) expenses were US$8.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to US$5.8 million in the same period in 2015, an increase of US$2.6 million, or 44.8%, This increase was primarily due to the increase of US$1.2 million in salary and welfare which was due to the increase in the number of management and general staff from supporting departments, US$0.6 million in commencement ceremony of Sichuan Xinda, US$0.2 million in rental fee and US$0.6 million of other miscellaneous expenses.

Research and Development Expenses

R D expenses were US$7.9 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with US$5.8 million during the same period in 2015, an increase of US$2.1 million, or 36.2%, reflecting our continuous efforts to adjust research and development activities on new products primarily for industrialized applications from automotive to other advanced fields such as ships, airplanes, high-speed rail, 3D printing materials, biodegradable plastics, and medical devices.

As of September 30, 2016, the number of ongoing research and development projects was 196. We expect to complete and commence to realize economic benefits on approximately 25% of the projects in the near term. The remaining projects are expected to be carried out for a longer period.

25 

Operating Income

Total operating income was US$53.1 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $17.3 million in the same period of 2015, representing an increase of 206.9% or US$35.8 million. This increase is primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by the higher general and administrative expenses and higher research and developed expenses. 

Interest Income (Expenses)

Net interest expense was US$9.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to net interest expense of US$8.3 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to (i) the decrease of interest income which was caused by the decrease of average interest rate of 1.4% for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2.5% for the same period of  2015, which was partially offset by the increase of average deposit balance in the amount of US$355.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to US$306.8 million for the same period of 2015; and (ii) the increase of interest expense which was caused by the increase of short-term and long-term loans in the amount of US$666.3 million for the three months ended September  30, 2016 as compared to US$368.0 million of prior year, which was partially offset by the decrease of average interest rate 4.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 5.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Loss on Debt Extinguishment 

On August 29, 2016 (the "Redemption Date"), the Company fully redeemed all of its 11.75% guaranteed senior notes due on February 4, 2019 (the "Notes") plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  The aggregate amount paid to redeem the Notes was US$166.6 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, which resulted in a charge of U$19.0 million as loss on debt extinguishment in the third quarter of 2016.

Income Taxes  

The effective income tax rate for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 20.8% and 35.5%, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the increase of US$17.4 million profits generated in tax exempted Dubai Composites for the three-month ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year,  partially offset by the US$19.0 loss on notes redemption by Favor Sea Limited which is exempted from income taxes on August 29, 2016.

26 

The effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 differs from the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% primarily due to the effect of the preferential tax rate of Sichuan Xinda, the tax rate differential on entities not subject to PRC income tax, super deduction of R D expense and partially offset by the effect of non-deductible expenses.

Our PRC and Dubai subsidiaries have US$298.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits as of September 30, 2016, which are planned to be indefinitely reinvested in the PRC and Dubai. The distributions from our PRC and Dubai subsidiaries are subject to the U.S. federal income tax at 34%, less any applicable foreign tax credits. Due to our policy of indefinitely reinvesting our earnings in our PRC business, we have not provided for deferred income tax liabilities related to PRC withholding income tax on undistributed earnings of our PRC subsidiaries. In addition, due to our policy of indefinitely reinvesting our earnings in Dubai, UAE, we have not provided for deferred income tax liabilities related to Dubai Composites in Dubai, UAE, on undistributed earnings.

Net Income

As a result of the above factors, we had a net income of US$20.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net income of US$6.0 million in the same quarter of 2015.

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015

Revenues

Revenues were US$824.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, an increase of US$97.6 million, or 13.4%, compared with US$726.4 million in the same period of last year, due to approximately 16.5% increase in sales volume and 2.6 % decrease  in the average selling price of our products.

For the nine-month ended September 30, 2016, we had an increase of 3.3% in the average RMB selling price of our products while the sales volume increased by 16.7% compared with those of last year in the domestic market. More sales were achieved in South China, Central China and Southwest China because of our marketing efforts to develop new customers. As for the RMB selling price, the increase was mainly due to higher-end product of modified PA6, PA66 and Plastic Alloy in China.

For the nine-month ended September 30, 2016 in the overseas market, we had a 1.9% increase in revenues due to the significant increase of 9.5% in sales volume, partially offset by 6.9% decrease in the average selling price as compared with those of last year.

The following table summarizes the breakdown of metric tons (MT) by product mix:

The Company continued to shift production mix from traditional Modified Polypropylene (PP) to higher-end products such as PA66, PA6, Plastic Alloy and POM, primarily due to (i) greater growth potential of advanced modified plastics in luxury automobile models in China, (ii) the stronger demand as a result of promotion by the Chinese government for clean energy vehicles, (iii) the Company's initiatives to market higher-margin PA66 and PA6,  and (iii) better quality from and consumer recognition of higher-end cars made by automotive manufacturers from Chinese and Germany joint ventures, and U.S. and Japanese joint ventures, which manufacturers tend to use more and higher-end modified plastics in quantity per vehicle in China. In addition, the Company sold primarily higher-end Plastic Alloy to the recently developed customer in the Republic of Korea.

Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit was US$164.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to US$129.4 million in the same period of 2015, representing an increase of 27.4%. Our gross margin increased to 20.0% during the nine-month ended September 30, 2016 from 17.8% during the same period of 2015,  primarily due to higher contribution of  higher-margin product sales in domestic markets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to that of the prior year.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative (G A) expenses were US$20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to US$17.3 million in the same period in 2015, representing an increase of 15.6%, or US$2.7 million. This increase is primarily due to the increase of US$2.3 million in salary and welfare which was due to the increase in the number of management and general staff from supporting departments, US$0.6 million in travelling and transportation expense, US$0.3 million in professional fee, US$ 0.3 million in rental fee and US$0.5 million of other miscellaneous expenses, offset by the decrease of US$1.3 million in non-income taxation expenses.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development (R D) expenses were US$18.7 million for the nine-month ended September 30, 2016 compared with US$18.3 million during the same period in 2015, an increase of US$0.4 million, or 2.2%, reflecting the Company's efforts to adjust research and development activities on new products primarily for industrialized applications from automotive to other advanced fields such as ships, airplanes, high-speed rail, 3D printing materials, biodegradable plastics, and medical devices. 

Operating Income

Total operating income was US$125.1 million for the nine-month ended September 30, 2016 compared to US$92.7 million in the same period of 2015, representing an increase of 35.0% or US$32.4 million. This increase is primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher general and administration expenses and R D expenses.

Interest Income (Expenses)

Net interest expense was US$27.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to net interest expense of US$25.2 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to (i) the decrease of interest income due to the average interest rate decreased to 1.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2.7 % of the same period in 2015, and partially offset by the increase of average deposit balance in amount of US$379.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to US$324.8 million for the same period in prior year; and (ii) the increase of interest expense which was due to the increase of average short-term and long-term loan balance in amount of US$543.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to US$387.8 million for the same period in 2015, and partially offset by the average interest rate decreased to 4.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 5.5% of the same period in 2015.  

30 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 18.9% and 17.3%, respectively, which differ from the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25%.  The increase was primarily due to the loss of US$19.0 million on the note redemption by the Favor Sea Limited which is exempted from income taxes on August 29, 2016, partially offset by the increased profits of US$31.6 million in the domestic markets.

The effective income tax rate differs from the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% primarily due to the effect of the preferential tax rate of Sichuan Xinda, the tax rate differential on entities not subject to PRC income tax, super deduction of R D expense and partially offset by the effect of non-deductible expenses.

Net Income

As a result of the above factors, we had a net income of US$64.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of US$56.9 million in the same period of 2015. 

Selected Balance Sheet Data as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

31 

Our financial condition continued to improve as measured by an increase of 8.1% in stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2016 as compared to that of December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits decreased by 26.3% or US$107.4 million due to the operating cash outflows. Inventories increased by 40.9% as a result of more purchases made by the Company to take advantage of the lower purchase price of the raw materials and the Company's strategy to stock up the inventory for the increasing demand from Sichuan plant. Property, plant and equipment, net increased by 43.3% mainly due to the delivery of the equipment of Dubai Xinda at the beginning of 2016. Prepayment to equipment suppliers decreased by 53.4% mainly because the equipment was delivered to Dubai, UAE. The aggregate short-term and long-term bank loans increased by 84.1% due to the utilization of existing lines of credit. We believe our current debt level is manageable. We define the manageable debt level as the sum of aggregate short-term and long-term loans, and notes payable over total assets.  

On August 29, 2016 (the "Redemption Date"), the Company fully redeemed all of its 11.75% guaranteed senior notes due on February 4, 2019 (the "Notes") plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  The aggregate amount paid to redeem the Notes was US$166.6 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, which resulted in a charge of U$19.0 million as loss on debt extinguishment for the nine-month period ended 2016.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Historically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures for new production lines. We have financed these requirements primarily from cash generated from operations, bank borrowings and the issuance of our convertible preferred stocks and debt financings. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had US$100.1 million and US$119.9 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents, which were primarily deposited with banks in China (including Hong Kong and Macau SAR), UAE and U.S. As of September 30, 2016, we had US$466.4 million outstanding short-term bank loans (including the current portion of long-term bank loans), including US$260.0 million unsecured loan and US$52.4 million loans secured by accounts receivable, US$42.5 million loans secured by restricted cash, and US$111.5 long-term bank loans that due in one year. We also had US$254.9 million long-term bank loans (excluding the current portion), including US$30.4 million loans secured by long-term deposits, US$50.9 million unsecured loan and US$173.6 million syndicate loan facility. Short-term and long-term bank loans in total bear a weighted average interest rate of 3.86% per annum and do not contain any renewal terms. We have historically been able to make repayments when due.  

A summary of lines of credit for the nine-month period ended September 30 2016 and the remaining line of credit as of September 30, 2016 is as below: 

32 

We have historically been able to make repayments when due. As of September 30, 2016, we have contractual obligations to pay (i) lease commitments in the amount of US$4.3 million, including US$1.5 million due in one year; (ii) equipment acquisition and facility construction in the amount of US$34.1 million; (iii) long-term bank loan in the amount of US$396.2 million (including principals and interests).

We expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and bank borrowings. 

We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities decreased to US$145.3 million cash outflow for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from net cash provided by operating activities of US$1.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to (i) the increase of approximately US$237.0 million in cash operating payments, including raw material purchases, rental and personnel costs, (ii) the increase of US$7.5 million in income tax payments, (iii) the decrease of US$2.1 million in interest income received,  (iv) the increase of US$1.9 million interest payments, and (v)  the decrease of approximately US$0.7 million cash inflow due to the forward contract settlement, partially offset by (vi) the increase of approximately US$100.6 million in cash collected from our customers for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, (vii) the increase of approximately US$1.4 million released from restricted cash and (viii) the increase of US$0.7 million received from government grant  for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 .

Investing Activities

Net cash used in the investing activities was US$28.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to US$101.7 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to (i)  the decrease of US$13.9 million acquisition of land use right and, (ii) the increase of US$8.5 million government grant related to the construction of Sichuan plant,  (iii) the decrease of US$19.3 million purchase of time deposits, (iv) the increase of US$42.6 million proceeds from maturity of time deposits, partially offset by the increase of US$10.7 million purchase of property, plant and equipment.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by the financing activities was US$155.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to US$108.1 million for the same period of last year, primarily as a result of (i) the increase of US$340.7 million borrowings of bank loans including the US$180.0 million syndicate loans, and (ii) the increase of US$46.9 million release from restricted cash as collateral for bank borrowings for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by (iii) the increase of US$144.1 million repayments of bank borrowings (iv) the increase of US$30.8 million of placement of restricted cash as collateral for bank borrowings, and (v) the redemption of US$165.4 million notes payable.

33 

As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents balance was US$100.1 million, compared to US$119.9 million at December 31, 2015.

Days Sales Outstanding ("DSO") has increased from 78 days for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 83 days for the nine-month ended September 30, 2016. 

We believe that our DSO is still well below industry average Industry Standard Customer and Supplier Payment Terms (days) as below:

Nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 

Year ended December 31, 2015

Customer Payment Term 

Payment in advance/up to 90 days  

Payment in advance/up to 90 days

Supplier Payment Term

Payment in advance/up to 90 days

Payment in advance/up to 90 days

Inventory turnover days has increased from 120 days for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 145 days for the nine-month ended September 30, 2016 due to the Company's strategy to take advantage of the lower purchase price of the raw materials and to stock up the inventory for the increasing demand from Sichuan plant. The   Company has the credit terms with major suppliers for 90 days in 2016, in order to better manage its operating cash flows.  Turnover days of payables have remained stable at 90 days for both the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine-month ended September 30, 2016. 

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities and financing activities will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. It is anticipated that the redemption will be funded by the Company's cash and bank deposits, existing credit facilities and other funding sources.

The majority of the Company's revenues and expenses were denominated primarily in Renminbi ("RMB"), the currency of the People's Republic of China. There is no assurance that exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. Dollar will remain stable.  Inflation has not had a material impact on the Company's business. 

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

The Company and certain of its officers and directors have been named as defendants in two putative securities class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  These actions, which allege violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, were filed on July 15, 2014 and July 16, 2014 and are captioned  Yang v. Han, et al ., No. 14-cv-5308 (GBD) and  Tompkins v. China XD Plastics Company Ltd., et al ., No. 14-cv-5359 (GBD), respectively.  On November 21, 2014, the Court consolidated the actions and appointed lead plaintiffs.  On February 17, 2015, the lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint on behalf of a class of all persons other than the defendants who purchased the common stock of China XD Plastics Company Limited between March 25, 2014 and July 10, 2014, both dates inclusive.  Specifically, the lead plaintiffs alleged that the Company and two of its officers made false or misleading statements and/or omitted material facts in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the Company's Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. They also asserted that the individual defendants are liable because they allegedly controlled the Company during the time the allegedly false and misleading statements and omissions were made.  The lead plaintiffs sought damages in unspecified amounts.  On April 3, 2015, the Company moved to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On March 23, 2016, the Court entered an Opinion and Order dismissing the Consolidated Class Action Complaint without prejudice.  On May 6, 2016, the lead plaintiffs moved the Court for leave to amend the Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On June 24, 2016, the Company filed its opposition to the lead plaintiffs' motion.  On August 8, 2016, in conjunction with filing the reply brief in support of their motion, the lead plaintiffs moved to strike certain documents referred to in the Company's opposition.  The Company filed its opposition to the lead plaintiffs' motion to strike on September 16, 2016.  The lead plaintiffs filed their reply on October 7, 2016.  Management believes the proposed amendment is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it. 
  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet transactions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short-term loans, long-term bank loans, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits. Although the interest rates, which are based on the banks' prime rates are fixed for the terms of the loans and deposits, increase in interest rates will increase our interest expense.

A hypothetical 1.0% increase in the annual interest rate for all of our credit facilities under which we had outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2016 would decrease income before income taxes by approximately US$5.4 million for the nine-month ended September 30, 2016. Management monitors the banks' prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

The majority of our revenues are collected in and our expenses are paid in RMB. We face foreign currency rate translation risks when our results are translated to U.S. dollars.  

The RMB was relatively stable against the U.S. dollar at approximately 8.28 RMB to the US$1.00 until July 21, 2005 when the Chinese currency regime was altered resulting in a 2.1% revaluation versus the U.S. dollar. From July 21, 2005 to June 30, 2010, the RMB exchange rate was no longer linked to the U.S. dollar but rather to a basket of currencies with a 0.3% margin of fluctuation resulting in further appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Since June 30, 2009, the exchange rate had remained stable at 6.8307 RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar until June 30, 2010 when the People's Bank of China allowed a further appreciation of the RMB by 0.43% to 6.798 RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar. The People's Bank of China allowed the RMB and U.S. dollar exchange rate to fluctuate within 1% on April 16, 2012 and 2% on March 17, 2014, respectively. On September 30, 2016, the RMB traded at 6.6778 RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar.

There remains international pressure on the Chinese government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy and the exchange rate of RMB is subject to changes in China's government policies which are, to a large extent, dependent on the economic and political development both internationally and locally and the demand and supply of RMB in the domestic market. There can be no assurance that such exchange rate will continue to remain stable in the future amongst the volatility of currencies, globalization and the unstable economies in recent years. Since (i) our revenues and net income of our PRC operating entities are denominated in RMB, and (ii) the payment of dividends, if any, will be in U.S. dollars, any decrease in the value of RMB against U.S. dollars would adversely affect the value of the shares and dividends payable to shareholders, in U.S. dollars.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company's management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operations of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

Notwithstanding management's assessment that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2015 due to one material weakness as identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report present fairly our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 in all material respects.

(b) Changes in internal controls.

During the nine-month ended September 30, 2016, our efforts to improve our internal controls over financial reporting include (1)  recruiting qualified accounting staff in Xinda CI (Beijing) Investment Holding Company Limited with requisite expertise and knowledge to help improve our internal control procedures, (2) adopting procedures to evaluate and assess performance of directors, officers and employees of the Company, (3) internal meetings, discussions, trainings and seminars periodically to review and improve our internal control procedures. We plan to improve on the above-referenced weakness by the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.
