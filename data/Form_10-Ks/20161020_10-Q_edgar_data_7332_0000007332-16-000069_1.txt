SOUTHWESTERN ENERG    Y COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1) BASIS OF PRESEN    TATION  

Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively  Southwestern  or the  Company ) is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and oil exploration, development and production ( E P ).      The Company is also focused on creating and capturing additional value through its natural gas gathering and marketing businesses ( Midstream ).  Southwestern conducts most of its   businesses through subsidiaries   and operates principally in   two   segments: E P and Midstream. 

Exploration and Production.      Southwestern s   primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil, with current operations principally focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas.    The Company s   operations in northeast Pennsylvania,   herein   refer  red   to as  Northeast Appalachia,  are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale.    O  perations in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania,   herein   refer  red   to as  Southwest Appalachia,  are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs.  Collectively,   Southwestern   refer  s   to   its   properties located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia as the  Appalachian Basin.     The Company s   operations in Arkansas are primarily focused on an unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Fayetteville Shale.    Southwestern   ha  s   exploration and production activities ongoing in Colorado and Louisiana, along with other areas in which   it     is   currently exploring for new development opportunities.    The Company   also ha  s   drilling rigs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas and provide  s   oilfield products and services, principally serving   its   E P operations. 

Midstream.        Through   the Company s   affiliated midstream subsidiaries,   Southwestern   engage  s   in natural gas gathering activities in Arkansas and Louisiana.      These activities primarily support   the Company s   E P operations and generate revenue from fees associated with the gathering of natural gas.        Southwestern s   marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of the natural gas, oil and NGLs produced in   its   E P operations. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.      Certain information relating to the Company s organization and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been appropriately condensed or omitted in this Quarterly Report.      The Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report include all normal and recurring material adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented herein.      It is recommended that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 201  5 ( 2015   Annual Report ). 

The Company s significant accounting policies, which have been reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors, are summarized in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement  s included in the Company s 2015   Annual Report. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation.  The effects of the reclassifications were not material to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

(3) REDUC    TION IN WORKFORCE 

In January 2016, the Company announced a   40%   workforce reduction of approximately   1,100   employees as a result of lower anticipated drilling activity.  This reduction was substantially complete  d     in the first quarter of 2016  .

The following table presents a summary of liabilities associated with the Company s restructuring activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which are reflected in accounts payable on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet (in millions):  

Severance payments and other separation costs related to restructuring will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter   and are not expected to be material  . 

(4) ACQUIS    ITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 

In September 2016, the Company sold approximately   55,000   net acres in West Virginia   to Antero Resources Corporation     for   approximately   $426     m  illion  , which reflects   customary adjustments at closing and is   subject to   customary   post-closing adjustments  .    Under full cost accounting rules,   the Company   accounted for the sale of these oil and natural gas properties as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of gain or loss as the sales did not involve a

Table of Contents  

significant change in proved reserves or significantly alter the relationship between costs and proved reserves.    In September 2016,   $48   million   of the net proceeds   was used to repay borrowings under the Company s term loan entered   into   in November 2015.    The Company intends to   use   the remaining net proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes, includin  g to fund capital projects. 

In May 2015, the Company sold conventional oil and gas assets located in East Texas and the Arkoma Basin for approximately $  211   million.    The Company   also accounted for the sale of these oil and natural gas properties as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of gain or loss as the sales did not involve a significant change in proved reserves or significantly alter the relationship between costs and proved reserves.    The proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce the Company s debt.  Approximately $  205   million of the proceeds received were recorded as a reduction of the capitalized costs of the Company s natural gas and oil properties in the United States pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.  

In April 2015, the Company sold its gathering assets located in Bradford and Lycoming counties in northeast Pennsylvania to Howard Midstream Energy Partners, LLC for an adjusted sales price of approximately $  489   million.  The net book value of these assets was   $206   million and was held in the Midstream segment as of the closing date.  A gain on sale of $  283   million was recognized and   wa  s included in gain on sale of assets, net on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.  The assets include  d   approximately   100   miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, with nearly   600   million cubic feet per day of capacity.  The proceeds from the transaction were used to substantially repay borrowings under the Company s   $500   million term loan facility that would have matured in   December 2016  .   

In January 2015, the Company completed an acquisition of certain natural gas and oil assets including approximately   46,700   net acres in northeast Pennsylvania from WPX Energy, Inc. for an adjusted purchase price of   $270   million (the  WPX Property Acquisition ).  This acreage was producing approximately   50   million net cubic feet of gas per day from   63   operated horizontal wells as of December 2014.  As part of this transaction, the Company assumed firm transportation capacity of   260   million cubic feet of gas per day predominantly on the Millennium pipeline.  The firm transport is being amortized over   19   years.  As of September     3  0  , 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company has   amortized   $15   million   and   $8   million, respectively.  This transaction was funded with the revolving credit facility and was accounted for as a business combination. 

In January 2015, the Company completed an acquisition of certain natural gas and oil assets from Statoil ASA   including   approximately 30,000   net   acres in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania   for $357 million, which   was   compris  ed     of   approximately 20% of Statoil s interests in   the properties   (the  Statoil Property Acquisition ).  All of these assets were also assets in which the Company had acquired interests under the Chesapeake Property Acquisition, as defined below.  This transaction was funded with the revolving credit facility and was accounted for as a business combination.  The Company allocated the purchase price to natural gas and oil properties, based on the respective fair values of the assets acquired. 

In December 2014, the Company completed an acquisition of certain oil and gas assets from Chesapeake Energy Corporation covering approximately 413,000 net acres in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania targeting natural gas, NG  Ls and crude oil contained in the Upper Devonian, Marcellus and Utica Shales for approximately   $5.0   billion (the  Chesapeake Property Acquisition ).  The transaction was temporarily financed using a $  4.5   billion   364  -day senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility and a $  500   million   two  -year unsecured term loan.  The Company repaid all principal and interest outstanding on the $4.5 billion bridge facility in January 2015 after permanent financing was finalized and, as a result, expensed   $47   million of short-term unamortized debt issuance costs related to the bridge facility in January 2015  ,   recognized in other interest charges on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.  The term loan facility was repaid in full in April 2015 with proceeds from the divestiture of the Company s northeastern Pennsylvania gathering assets and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 

(  5  ) NATURAL GA    S AND OIL PROPERTIES 

The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development an  d acquisition of natural gas and   oil   properties  .    Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities a  re capitalized on a country-by-  country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units-of-production method.      These capitalized costs     are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs  , net of applicable deferred taxes,   to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas  ,   oil   and NGL   reserves discounted at   10  %   (standardized measure)   plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties.      Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense.      The expense may not be reversed in future periods,   even though higher  

10   

Table of Contents  

natural gas,   oil   and NGL   prices may subsequently increase the ceiling.      Companies   using the full cost method are required to   use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, incl  uding the impact of derivatives designated     for   hedge   accounting  , to calculate the   ceiling value of their reserves. 

Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous   12   months for Henry Hub natural gas   of $  2.28   per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil of $  38.17   per barrel and NGLs of $  6.46   per barrel, adjusted for market differentials, the Company s net book value of its United States natural gas and oil properties exceeded   the ceiling   by   $506   million     (net of tax) at September 30  , 2016 and resulted in a non-cash ceiling test impairment.      The Company had   no hedge positions     that were designated for hedge   account  ing     as of September     3  0  , 2016.        Decreases in market prices as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and production costs could result in future ceiling test impairments. 

Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous   12   months for Henry Hub natural gas   of $  3.06   per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil   of $  55.73   per   barrel and   NGLs   of   $8.62   per barrel  , adjusted for market differentials, the net book value of the Company s United States natura  l gas and oil   properties exceeded the   ceiling   by   $1,746   million (net of tax) at September 30, 2015   and result  ed   in a   non-cash ceiling test impairment  .      Cash flow hedges of natural gas production in   place increased   the ceiling amount by   approximately   $40   million   as of September 30, 2015  .        In the first and second quarters of 2016, the Company s net book value of its United States and Canada natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $641 million (net of tax) at March 31, 2016 and $297 million (net of tax) at June 30, 2016, resulting in non-cash ceiling test impairments in each quarter. 

(  6  ) EARN    INGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net   income (loss) attributable   to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during   the reportable period  .    The diluted earnings per share calculation adds to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding: the incremental shares that would have been outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options, the vesting of unvested restricted shares of common stock  ,     performance units,   the assumed conversion of mandatory convertible preferred stock   and the shares of common stock declared as a preferred stock dividend  .    An antidilutive impact is an increase in earnings per share or a reduction in net loss per share resulting from the conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of certain securities.  

In July 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of   98,900,000   shares of its common stock, with an offering price to the public of   $13.00   per share.  Net proceeds, after underwriting discount and offering expenses, from the common stock offering were approximately   $1,247   million.  The proceeds from the offering were used to repay   $375   million of the   $750   million term loan entered into in November 2015 and to settle certain tender offers by purchasing an aggregate principal amount of approximately   $700   million of the Company s outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018.  The remaining proceeds of the offering will be used for general corporate purposes. 

In January 2015, the Company completed concurrent underwritten public offerings of   30,000,000   shares of its common stock and   34,500,000   depositary shares (both share counts include shares issued as a result of the underwriters exercising their options to purchase additional shares).      The common stock offering was priced at   $23.00   per share.      Net proceeds, after underwriting discount and expenses, from the common stock offering were approximately   $669   million.      Net proceeds, after underwriting discount and expenses, from the depositary share offering were approximately   $1.7   billion.      Each depositary share represents a   1/20th   interest in a share of the Company s mandatory convertible preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of   $1,000   per share (equivalent to a   $50   liquidation preference per depositary share).      The proceeds from the offerings were used to partially repay borrowings under the Company s   $4.5   billion   364  -day bridge facility with the remaining balance of the bridge facility fully repaid with proceeds from the Company s January 2015 public offering of   $2.2   billion in long-term senior notes.  

The mandatory convertible pref  erred stock entitles the holder   to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of the convertible preferred stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights.      Unless converted earlier at the option of the holders, on or around January 15, 2018 each share of convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into between   37.0028   and   43.4782   shares of the Company s common stock (and, correspondingly, each depositary share will convert into between   1.85014   and   2.17391   shares of the Company s common stock), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, depending on the volume-weighted average price of the Company s common stock over a   20   trading day averaging period immediately prior to that date.    The total potential shares of common stock resulting from the conversion will range from   63,829,830   to   74,999,895   shares.

The mandatory convertible preferred stock has the non-forfeitable right to participate on an as  -  converted basis at the conversion rate then in effect in any common stock dividends declared and as such, is considered a participating security.      A  ccordingly  , it is included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, pursuant to the two-class method.      In the calculation of basic earnings per share attributable to common shareholders, participating securities are allocated earnings based on actual dividend distributions received plus a proportionate share of undistributed net income attributable to common shareholders, if any, after recognizing distributed earnings.      The Company s participating securities do not participate in undistributed net losses because they are not contractually obligated to do so.  

On September     21  , 2016  , the Company declared its quarterly dividend, payable to holders of the mandatory convertible preferred stock  , and   announced that it would pay the   quarterly   dividend in common stock, in lieu of cash, to the extent permitted by the certificate of designations for the Series B preferred stock.    The Company   issued   2,043,780     shares of common stock on October 17, 2016 in payment for the dividend.  Dividends declared in the first and   second quarters of 2016 were settled in common stock, while the dividend declared in December 2015 was paid in cash in January 2016. 

The following table presents the computation of earnings per share for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

Due to   the net loss     for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016   and 2015  , the unvested stock options were not recognized in diluted earnings per share calculations as they would   have had an antidilutive effect  .       Options   for   3,409,596   shares   and   3,714,095     shares     were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016, respectively, because they would have had an antidilutive effect.  Options   for   3,796,778   shares   and   3,778,140   shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, because they would have had an antidilutive effect.

Due to   the   net loss for   the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,   the unvested share-based payments were not recognized in diluted earnings per share calculations as they would have had an antidilutive effect.  The calculation   excluded   599,372   shares and   993,576   sh  ares     of restricted stock   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, because they would have had an antidilutive effect.  The calculation   excluded   1,469,380   shares and   1,472,379   shares of restricted stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, because they would have had an antidilutive effect  .

(7  ) DERIVATIVES A    ND RISK MANAGEMENT 

The Company is exposed to volatility in market prices and basis di  fferentials for natural gas,   oil   and NGLs   which impacts the predictability of its cash flows related to the sale of   those commodities  .    These risks are managed by the Company s use of certain derivative financial instruments.  As of   September   3  0, 2016  , the Company s derivative financial instruments consisted of   fixed price swaps, purchased put options, two-way costless collars, three-way costless collars,     basis swaps, sold call options and interest rate swaps.  The Company had basis swaps and sold call options as of December 31, 2015.    A description of the Company s derivative financial instruments is provided below: 

Fixed price swaps  

The Company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to the counterparty.  

Purchased put options  

The Company purchases put options from the counterparty by payment of a cash premium.  If the market price is lower than the put s strike price at the time of settlement, the Company receives from the counterparty such difference on purchased put options.  If the market price settles above the put s strike price, no payment is due from either party.  

Two-way costless collars  

Arrangements that contain a fixed floor price (purchased put option) and a fixed ceiling price (sold call option) which, in aggregate, have no net cost.  At the contract settlement date, (1) if the index price is higher than the ceiling price, the Company pays the counterparty the difference between the index price and ceiling price, (2) if the index price is between the floor price and the ceiling price, no payments are due from either party, and (3) if the index price is below the floor price, the Company will receive the difference between the floor price and the index price.   

Three-way costless collars  

Arrangements that   contain a purchased put option, a sold call option and   a sold put option which, in aggregate, have no net cost.  At the contract settlement date, (1) if the index price is higher than the ceiling price, the Company pays the counterparty the difference between the index price and ceiling price, (2) if the index price is between the middle strike price and the ceiling price, no payments are due from either party, (3) if the index is between the lowest strike price and the middle strike price, the Company will receive the difference between the middle strike price and the index price, and (4) if the index price is below the floor price, the Company will receive the difference between the purchased put strike price and the sold put strike price.  

Basis swaps  

Arrangements that guarantee a price differential for natural gas from a specified delivery point.  The Company receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract.   

Sold   call options  

The Company sells call options in exchange for a premium.     I  f the market price exceeds the   strike   price of the call option     a  t the time of settlement, the Company pays the counterparty such excess on sold call options.      If the market price settles below the   call s strike price  , no payment is due from either party.  

Interest rate swaps  

Interest rate swaps are used to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness.      The purpose of these instruments is to manage the Company s existing or anticipated exposure to un  favorable interest rate changes.  

The Company utilizes counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are creditworthy at the time the transactions are entered into and the Company closely monitors the credit ratings of these counterparties.      Additionally, the Company performs both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable.      However, the events in the financial markets in recent years demonstrate there can be no assurance that a counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Company.

At September 30, 2016, the net fair value of the Company s financial instruments related to natural   gas was a   $42   million liability.  The net fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps was a  n     $8   million liability at Septem  ber 30, 2016. 

Derivative Contracts   not Designated for Hedge Accounting 

As of September 30  , 2016, the Company   had no   positions designated for hedge accounting treatment  .  G  ains and losses on derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment  ,   or that do not meet hedge accounting requirements  ,   are recorded as a component of gain (loss) on derivatives   on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations  .    Accordingly,   the gain (loss) on derivatives component of the statement  s   of operations   reflects the   gains   and losses   on   both settled and unsettled   derivatives.      The Company calculates gains   and   losses on   settled   derivatives as the summation of gains and losses on positions which have settled within the   reporting   period.    Only the settled gains and losses are included in the Company s realized commodity price calculations.  

The Company is a party to interest rate swaps that were entered into to mitigate the Company s exposure to volatility in interest rates.      The interest rate swaps   have   a notional amount   of   $170   million   and expire in   June 2020  .        The Company did not designate the interest rate swaps for hedge accounting   treatment  .  Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in gain (loss) on derivatives   o  n the   unaudited condensed   consolidated statements of operations.

Excluding interest rate swaps, t  hese amounts are included, along with gas sales revenues, in the calculation of the Company s realized natural gas price  .     

Derivative Contracts   Designated for Hedge Accounting 

A  ll derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and are measured at fair value other than transactions for which normal purchase/normal sale is applied.      Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be   designated for hedge accounting  .  Accounting guidance for qualifying hedges allows an unsettled derivative s unrealized gains and losses to be recorded either in earnings or as a component of other comprehensive income until settled.  In the period of settlement, the Company recognizes the gains and losses from these qualifying hedges in   gas sales   revenues.        As of   September 30  , 2016, the   Company   had no   positions designated for hedge accounting treatment  .    In 2015, the Company had certain fixed price swaps that were designated for hedge accounting.  For the three   and nine   months ended   September     3  0  , 2  015, the Company reported pre-tax   gain  s     in other comprehensive income   of   $14     million   and     $35   million  , respectively,   related to the effective portion of our unsettled fixed price swaps.  The ineffective portion of those fixed price swaps was recognized in earnings and had an inconsequential impact to the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three   and nine months ended September 30  , 2015.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,    pre-tax   gain  s   of     $50   million     and   $145   million  , respectively,   on settled fixed   p  rice swaps w  ere   transferred from other comprehensive income into gas sales revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.

(  9  ) FAIR VALU    E MEASUREMENTS 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of   September     3  0  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5   were as follows: 

(1) 

The maturity date will accelerate to   October 2019   if, by that date, the Company has not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least   $765   million   of its 2020 Senior Notes.     

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,   other current assets  ,     accounts payable   and   other   current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets approxim  ate fair value because of their short-term   nature.      For debt and derivative instruments, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value: 

Debt:      The fair values of the Company s senior notes were based on the market   value   of the Company s publicly traded debt as determined based on the yield of the Company s senior notes.  

The carrying values of the borrowings under the Company s   term loan facilities   approximate fair value because the interest rate is variable and reflective of market rates.      The Company considers the fair value of its debt to be a Level 2 measurement on the fair value hierarchy.   

17   

Table of Contents  

Derivative Instruments:        The fair value of all derivative instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties.      The amounts are based on quoted market prices, best estimates obtained from counterparties and an option pricing model, when necessary, for price option contracts. 

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.      As presented in the tables below, this hierarchy consists of three broad levels:  

Level   1   valuations   -   Consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority  . 

Level 2 valuations   -   Consist of quoted market information for the ca  lculation of fair market value. 

Level 3 valuations   -   Consist of internal estimates and have the lowest priority. 

The Company has classified its derivatives into these levels depending upon the data utilized to determine their fair values.      The Company s fixed price swaps (Level 2) are estimated using third-party discounted cash flow calculations using the NYMEX futures index.      The Company utilized discounted cash flow models for valuing its interest rate derivatives (Level 2).      The net derivative values attributable to the Company's interest rate derivative contracts as of   September 30, 2016   are based on (i) the contracted notional amounts, (ii) active market-quoted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) yield curves and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve.      The Company s   sold call options, purchased put options, two-way costless collars and three-way costless collars   (Level 3) are valued using the Black-Scholes model, an industry standard option valuation model that takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the NYMEX futures index, interest rates, volatility and credit worthiness.  The Company s basis swaps (Level 3) are estimated using   third-party   calculations based upon forward commodity price curves. 

Inputs to the Black-Scholes model, including the volatility input, which is the significant unobservable input for Level 3 fair value measurements, are obtained from a third-party pricing source, with independent verification of the most significant inputs on a monthly basis.      An increase (decrease) in volatility would result in an increase (decrease) in fair value measurement, respectively.

The table below presents reconciliations for the change in net fair value of derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobse  rvable inputs (Level 3) for the three and nine months   ended   September     3  0  , 201  6     and 2015.  The fair values of Level 3 derivative instruments are estimated using proprietary valuation models that utilize both market observable and unobservable parameters.  Level 3 instruments presented in the table consist of net derivatives valued using pricing models incorporating assumptions that, in the Company s judgment, reflect reasonable assumptions a marketplace partic  ipant would have used as of September   30, 2016 and 2015.

2016 Credit Facility    

In June 2016, the Company reduced its existing   $2.0   billion unsecured revolving credit facility to   $66   million and entered into a new credit agreement for   $1,934   million, consisting of a   $1,191   million secured term loan and a new   $743   million unsecured revolving credit facility, which   matures in   December 2020  .  The   maturity date will accelerate to October 2019 if, by that date, the Company has not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least   $765   million   of its 2020 Senior Notes.    The $1,191 million secured term loan is fully drawn, with approximately   $285   million of this balance used to pay down the previous revolving credit   facility bala  nce in its entirety.  As of September   30, 2016, there were   no   borrowings under   either revolving credit facilit  y  , however, there was   $174   million   in letters of credit outstanding against the 2016 revolving credit facility.   

Loans under the 2016 credit agreement are subject to varying rates of interest based on whether the loan is a Eurodollar loan or an alternate base rate loan.  Eurodollar loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate, which is adjusted LIBOR plus applicable margins ranging from   1.750%   to   2.500%  .  Alternate base rate loans bear interest at the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin ranging from   0.750%   to   1.500%  .    The interest rate on the term loan facility is determined based upon the Company s public debt ratings and   was   250   basis   points over the LIBOR as of September 30, 2016. 

The new term loan and revolving credit facility contain financial covenants that impose certain restrictions on the Company.  Under the new credit agreement, the Company must maintain a minimum interest coverage of   0.75x   in 2016, increasing by   0.25x   increments per year to   1.50x   in 2019 and   2020  .  The Company is also subject to a minimum liquidity requirement of   $300   million, which could be increased up to   $500   million upon certain conditions, as well as an anti-hoarding provision, requiring unrestricted cash in excess of   $100   million to pay down any amounts borrowed under the new revolving credit facility.  The financial covenant with respect to minimum interest coverage consists of EBITDAX divided by consolidated interest expense.  EBITDAX   excludes the effects of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, any non-cash impacts from impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on asset sales, unamortized issuance cost, unamortized debt discount and   certain restructuring costs.  Colla  teral for the new secured term loan is principally the Company s E P properties in the Fayetteville Shale area, and the new credit agreement requires a minimum collateral coverage ratio of   1.50x   the new secured term loan.  This collateral also may support all or a part of revolving credit extensions depending on restrictions in the Company s senior notes indentures. 

A  s of   September 30, 2016  , the   Company was in compliance with   all of the covenants of this credit agreement.  Although the Company does not anticipate any violations of the financial covenants, its ability to comply with these covenants is dependent upon the success of its exploration and development program and upon factors beyond the Company s control, such as the market prices for natural gas and oil.

2013 Credit Facility 

In December 2013,   the Company   entered into a credit agreement that exchanged   its   previous revolving credit facility.  Under the revolving credit facility,   the Company   had a borrowing capacity of   $2.0   billion.    The revolving credit facility was unsecured and was not guaranteed by any subsidiaries.  In June 2016, this credit facility was substantially exchanged for a new credit   facility   comprised of a   $1,191     m  illion secured term loan and a new   $743     m  illion revolving credit facility.  The borrowing capacity of the original 2013 credit agreement was reduced from $2.0 billion to   $66   million  , remains unsecured   and the maturity remain  s     December 2018  .  As of September   30, 2016, there   were   no   borrowings under this facility. 

The existing unsecured 2013 revolving credit facility includes a financial covenant under which the Company may not have total debt in excess of   60%   of its total adjusted book capital.  This financial covenant with respect to capitalization percentages excludes the effects of any full cost ceiling impairments, certain hedging activities and the Company s pension and other postretirement liabilities. 

2015 Term Facility    

In November 2015, the Company entered into a   $750   million unsecured   three  -year term loan credit agreement with various lenders that was utilized to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility.  The interest rate on the term loan facility is determined based upon the Company s public debt ratings from Moody s and S P and   was   250   basis   points over LIBOR as of September 30, 2016.  The term loan facility requires prepayment unde  r certain circumstances from the net cash proceeds of sales of equity or certain assets and borrowings outside the ordinary course of business.      In June 2016, the 2015 term loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity date   upon   a repayment threshold.  As a result of the July 2016 equity offering, the Company repaid   $375   million of the $750 million term loan, which had the effect of extending   the term loan   maturity from   November 2018   to   December 2020  , which will accelerate   to   October 2019   if, by that date, the Company has not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least   $765   million   of its 2020 Senior Notes.    As a result of the repayment, the Company   expensed   $3   million   of unamortized debt issuance costs, recognized in other interest charges on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .    In September 2016, the Company repaid a  n additional   $48   million   from the proceeds received from   the closing of the sale of approximately   55,000   net acres in West Virginia to Antero Resources Corporation,   resulting   in an additional   $0.4   million   of interest expense related to unamortized debt issuance costs. 

Senior Notes 

In January 2015, the Company completed a public offering of   $350   million aggregate principal amount of its   3.30%   senior notes due   2018   (the  2018 Notes ),   $850   million aggregate principal amount of its   4.05%   senior notes due   2020   (the  2020 Notes ) and   $1.0   billion aggregate principal amount of its   4.95%   senior notes due   2025   (the  2025 Notes  together with the 2018 and 2020 Notes, the  Notes ), with net proceeds from the offering totaling approximately   $2.2   billion after underwriting discounts and offering expenses.  The proceeds from this offering were used to repay the remaining principal and interest outstanding under the Company s   $4.5   billion   364  -day bridge term loan facility, which was first reduced with proceeds from the Company s concurrent underwritten public offerings of common and preferred stock, and were also used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility.    As a result of this repayment, the Company expensed   $47   million of short-term unamortized debt issuance costs related to the bridge facility in January 2015  ,   recognized in other interest charges on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the   three   months ended   March 31, 2015  .    The Notes were sold to the public at a price of   99.949%   of their face value for the 2018 Notes,   99.897%   of their face value for the 2020 Notes and   99.782%   of their face value for the 2025 Notes.  The interest rates on the Notes are determined based upon the public bond ratings from Moody s and S P.  Downgrades on the Notes from either rating agency increase interest costs by   25   basis points per downgrade level   and upgrades decrease interest costs by   25   basis points per upgrade level   on the following semi-annual bond interest payment.  In February and June 2016, Moody s and S P downgraded the Notes, increasing the interest rates   by   175   basis points   effective July 2016.  As a result of the downgrades, interest rates increased to   5.05%   for the 2018 Notes,   5.80%   for the 2020 Notes and   6.70%   for the 2025 Notes.  In the event of future downgrades, the coupons for this series of notes are capped at   5.30%  ,    6.05%   and   6.95%  , respectively.  T  he first coupon payment to bondholders   at the   higher interest rate  s     will be   paid in J  anuary   201  7.

In July 2016, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the July 2016 equity offering to settle certain tender offers by purchasing an aggregate principal amount of approximately   $700   million of the Company s outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in   a loss of   $51   million for the early retirement and redemption of these senior notes     includ  ing     $50   million of premi  ums paid. Additionally, the Company expensed   $2   million of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, recognized in other interest charges.  

(1  1  ) COMMIT    MENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Operating Commitments and Contingencies 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s contractual obligations for demand and similar charges under firm transportation and gathering agreements to guarantee access capacity on natural gas and liquids pipelines and gathering   systems totaled   approximately   $8.6 billion  ,   $3.4   billion   of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and additional construction efforts.  The Company also had guarantee obligations of   up to $  862   million   of   that amount.  As of September   30, 2016, future payments under non-cancelable firm transportation and gathering agreements are as follows:  

Environmental Risk 

The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.      Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated.      Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. 

Litigation   

The Company is subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties, and pollution, contamination or nuisance.      Management believes that such litigation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.      Many of these matters are in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inhe  rent uncertainties; therefore, m  anagement s view may change in the future.      If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.      The Company accrues for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  

Berry-Helfand (Tovah Energy) 

In February 2009, one of the Company s subsidiaries was added as a defendant in a case then styled Tovah Energy, LLC and Toby Berry-Helfand v. David Michael Grimes, et al., then pending in the 273rd District Court in Shelby County, Texas.  The plaintiff alleged that the subsidiary used information provided by the plaintiff under a confidentiality agreement, which she claimed, among other things, breached the agreement and constituted a misappropriation of a trade secret.  Following a trial in December 2010, the court awarded approximately   $11   million in actual damages and approximately   $24   million in disgorgement of profits.  Both sides appealed, and in July 2013 the Texas Court of Appeals for the Twelfth District reversed on all claims except misappropriation of trade secrets, reduced the judgment to the actual damages award and ordered the case remanded for an award of attorneys  fees to the Company s subsidiary on one of the claims on which judgment was reversed.  Both parties petitioned the Supreme Court of Texas for review.  On June 10, 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that insufficient evidence supported the damage award and remanded the case for a new trial.  The date for the new trial has not yet been set.

The Company s subsidiary continues to deny that it breached any obligation or misappropriated any trade secret, the only two remaining claims.  Based on the Company s understanding and judgment of the facts and merits of this case, and after considering the advice of counsel, the Company has determined that, although reasonably possible, a materially adverse final outcome to this action is not probable.  As such, the Company has not accrued any amounts with respect to this action.  The Company s assessment may change in the future depending on further court proceedings, and such a re-assessment could lead to the determination that the potential liability is probable and could be material to the Company s results of operations, fi  nancial position or cash flows. 

Arkansas Royalty Litigation 

Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are defendants in   three   cases,   two   filed in Arkansas state court in 2010 and 2013 and   one   in federal court in 2014, on behalf of putative classes of royalty owners on some of the Company s leases located in Arkansas.  The chief complaint in all three cases is that one of the Company s subsidiaries underpaid the royalty owners by, among other things, deducting from royalty payments costs for gathering, transportation, and compression of natural gas in excess of what is permitted by the relevant leases.  In September and October 2014, the judges in the two Arkansas state actions entered orders certifying classes of royalty owners who are citizens of Arkansas.  The Company s subsidiaries have appealed those orders.  Oral argument on both cases has been set for November 2016. 

On November 17, 2015, the court in the federal case denied the plaintiff s motion to certify a class of royalty owners not included in either of the two state cases.    On April 11, 2016, the court certified a broader class that includes Arkansas residents and citizens  .    The plaintiff in the federal case presented two alternative damages theories.  Under one theory, plaintiffs have asserted that obligations to affiliates are not  incurred  and therefore the exploration and production subsidiary was not entitled to deduct any post-production costs; the federal court has granted partial summary judgment for the Company s subsidiaries on this theory.  Under another theory, plaintiffs assert that the gathering and treating rates the Company deducted from royalty payments exceeded the affiliates  actual costs or otherwise were not reasonable.  The plaintiffs have not disclosed a specific damage calculation for any putative class, but based on the class representative s disclosure regarding the calculation of claimed damages, class-wide damages could exceed   $100   million.    The Company has moved for summary judgement.  A trial date has not been set. 

In addition, in September 2015   three   cases were filed in Arkansas state court on behalf of a total of   248   individually named plaintiffs.  Each case asserts complaints that are in substance virtually identical to the above-described case.  The Company and its subsidiaries have removed two of the cases to federal court, and those cases have been assigned to the court in which the above-described federal case is pending.  All three cases have been stayed. 

Management believes that, in all of the above cases, the deductions from royalty payments as calculated are permitted and intends to defend the cases vigorously.  The Company s assessment may change in the future due to the occurrence of certain events, such as adverse judgments, and such a re-assessment could lead to the determination that the potential liability is probable and could be material to the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Indemnifications 

The Company provides certain indemnifications in relation to dispositions of   assets.    These indemnifications typically relate to disputes, litigation or tax matters existing at the date of disposition.        No   liability has been recognized in connection with these indemnifications.

(1  2  ) PENSION     PLAN AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 

The Company has defined pension and postretirement benefit plans which cover substantially all of the Company s employees.      Net periodic pension costs include the following   components for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  :   

In January 2016, the Company initiated a reduction in workforce that was effectively completed by the end of the first quarter  .  As a result of the workforce reduction, the Company recognized   a     $1   million   non-cash curtailment loss related to its pension plan for both the curtailment-related decrease to the benefit obligation and the recognition of the proportionate share of unrecognized prior service cost and net loss from other comprehensive income (loss) in the second quarter of 2016.  Additionally, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement   loss of   $2   million and   $10   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, related to a   total of   $35   million   of lump sum payments from the pension plan during the second and third quarters of 2016.  

The Company s   other   postretirement benefit plan had a net periodic benefit cost   (gain)     of   $1  ,   $1  ,   ($4)   and     $3   million   for   the three months ended   September    3  0  , 2016 and 2015   and nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Included in the net peri  odic benefit cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   is a   curtailment gain of   $6   million, which more than offset the other components of net periodic benefit cost. 

As of September 30  , 2016, the Company has   contributed   $8   million   to the pension   and other postretirement benefit   plan  s   in 2016  .  The Company expects to contribute an   additional   $3   million   during the remainder of 2016.  The Company recognized a   liability of   $40   million and   $12   million   related to its pension and other postretirement be  nefits, respectively, as of September   30, 2016  ,   compared to a liability of   $31   million and   $20   million   as of December 31, 2015.  The Company updated the discount rate used in the measurement of the benefit obligation of the pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan to   4.20%   in the   second   quarter of 2016.  The Company used an assumption of   4.60%   from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016 for both the pension and   other   postretirement benefit plans.  

The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation supplemental retirement savings plan ( Non-Qualified Plan ) for certain key employees who may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their compensation, as permitted by the plan.      Shares of the Company s common stock purchased under the terms of the Non-Qualified Plan are presented as treasury stock   and   totaled   31,269   shares   at   September     3  0  , 2016  ,   compared to   47,149     s  hares at December 31, 2015  .

(1  3  ) STOCK-BASE    D COMPENSATION 

The Company recognized the following amounts in employee stock-based compensation costs for the three   and nine     months ended September 30, 2016   and 201  5  : 

(1) 

Includes   $16   million   and $3 million   related to the reduction in   workforce and executive management restructuring, respectively, for the nine months ended September   30, 2016.     

In January 2016, the Company announced a   40%   workforce reduction that was substantially concluded by the end of March 2016.  In April 2016, the Company also partially restructured executive management, which was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2016.  Affected employees were offered a severance package that included, if applicable, amendments to outstanding equity awards that modified forfeiture provisions on separation from the Company.  As a result, unvested stock-based equity awards became fully vested at the time of separation.  These shares were revalued and recognized immediately as a component of restructuring charges on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

As of September 30, 2016  ,   there   was $  55   million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company s unvested stock option grants, restricted stock grants and performance units.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2     y  ears  . 

Stock Options

Equity-Classified Performance Units 

The following table summarizes performance unit activity   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016     to be paid   out in Company stock   and provides information for unvested units as o  f September 30, 2016  .    The performance units   awarded in 2013 and 2014   inclu  ded a market condition based on r  elative Total Shareholder Return ( TSR ) and a performance condition based on the Company's Present Value Index ( PVI ), collectively the  Performance Measures  .         The fair value of the TSR market condition of the performance units is based on a Monte Carlo model and is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.      The fair value of the PVI performance condition of the p  erformance units is based on   economic analysis for each investment opportunity based upon the expected present value added for each dollar to be invested and amortized to com  pensation expense on a straight-  line basis over the vesting period of the award.    The performance units awarded in 2016 and 2015 are based exclusively on TSR.    The grant date fair value is calculated using the   applicable   Performance Measures and the closing price of the Company s common stock at the grant date.

These amounts reflect the number of performance units granted in thousands.  The actual payout of shares may range from a minimum of zero shares to a maximum of two shares contingent upon the actual performance against the applicable Performance Measures.     

Liability-Classified Performance Units 

Prior to 2013, c  ertain employees were provided performance units vesting equally over   three   yea  rs, payable in cash.  The payout of these units wa  s based on certain metrics, such as total shareholder return and reserve replacement efficiency, compared to a predetermined group of peer companies and Company goal  s  .  At the end of each performance period, the value of the vest  ed performance units, if any, would be     paid in cash.  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company     completed the final payout under these performance unit agreements  . 

(1  4  ) SEGM    ENT INFORMATION 

The Company s reportable business segments have been identified based on the differences in products or services provided. Revenues for the E P segment are derived from the production and sale of natural gas and liquids.      The Midstream segment generates revenue through the marketing of both Company and third-party produced natural gas and liquids volumes and through gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market. 

Summarized financial information for the Company s reportable segments is shown in the following table.      The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the 201  5   Annual Report.      Management evaluates the performance of its segments based on operating income, defined as operating revenues less operating costs.      Income before income taxes, for the purpose of reconciling the operating income amount shown below to consolidated income before income taxes, is the sum of oper  ating income, interest expense,   gain (loss) on derivatives,   loss on early extinguishment of debt   and other   income (loss  )  .    The    Other  column includes items not related to the Company s reportable segments including real estate and corporate items.

Other assets represent corporate assets not allocated to segments and assets for non-reportable segments.    At September 30, 2016, other assets includes   approximately   $1,443   million   in marketable securities.     

(5) 

Capital investments includes   increases of   $27   million and     $6   million   for the three months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,   and   decreases of   $24   million     and   $5   million   for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relating to the change in accrued expenditures between periods.  E P capital for t  he nine month period ended September   30, 2015 includes approximately   $516   million related to the WPX Property and Statoil Property Acquisitions.  Midstream capit  al for the nine months ended September   30, 2015 includes approximately   $119   million associated with the intangible asset related to the firm transportation acquired through the WPX Property Acquisition.

Corporate assets include cash and cash equivalents, furniture and fixtures and other costs.      Corporate general and administrative costs, depreciation expense and taxes other than income are allocated to the segments.       

(15)  INCOME     TAXES 

The Company s effective tax rate was   approximately   3%   and   1%   for   the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016,   respectively,   primarily as a result of the recognition of a valuation allowance.    A $20 million tax benefit was recognized in the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to   the   laps  e of the   statute   of   limitations on uncertain tax positions associated with alternative minimum tax  . 

A valuation   allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  To assess that likelihood, the Company uses estimates and judgment regarding future taxable income, and considers the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where such taxable income is generated, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required.  Such evidence can include current financial position, results of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as the current and forecasted business economic  s of the oil and gas industry. 

Due to the material write-downs of the carrying value of natural gas   and   oil properties and operating results, the Company is in a net deferred   tax asset po  sition.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax   assets   will not be realized     and recorded   a   $2  56   million and   $9  03   million     tax expense for the increase in our valuation allowance   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively  .  Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred   tax assets.    A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the projected cumulative loss incurred over the   three  -year period ending December 31, 2016.  Such objective negative evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective positive evidence, such as projections for future growth.      The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as future expected growth. 

(1  6  )  NEW ACCOUNTI    NG PRONOUNCEMENTS  

New Accounting Standards Implemented 

In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805) ( Update 2015-16 ), which seeks to reduce the complexity of amounts recognized in a business combination.  The amendments in Update 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The amendments in Update 2015-16 require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The amendments in Update 2015-16 require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount

recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The amendments in Update 2015-16 were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company adopted this update in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in no impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

In May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent) ( Update 2015-07 ), which amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement.  The standard removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and removes certain related disclosure requirements.  The amendments in Update 2015-07 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this update in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in no impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( Update 2015-03 ), in an effort to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs.  Update 2015-03 required that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs was not affected by the amendments in this Update.  Entities were required to apply the amendments in Update 2015-03 on a retrospective basis, with the balance sheet of each individual period presented adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance.  In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( Update 2015-15 ), which addressed the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, given the absence of authoritative guidance within Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.  For public entities, Update 2015-03 and Update 2015-15 were effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The Company adopted this update in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in an immaterial impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  At December 31, 2015, the Company had   $24   million in unamortized debt expense that was classified as a long-term asset which is now presented as a contra liability as a result of adoption.   

In November 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging   Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (Subtopic 815-15) ( Update 2014-16 ), addresses diversity in practice related to the determination of whether derivative features embedded in hybrid instruments issued in the form of a share should be bifurcated and accounted for separately.  For public entities, Update 2014-16 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The Company adopted this update in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in no impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) ( Update 2016-15 ), which seeks to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, Update 2016-15 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of Update 2016-15 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ( Update 2016-09 ), which seeks to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows.      For public entities, Update 2016-09 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.      The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of Update 2016-09 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( Update 2016-02 ), which seeks to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by, among other things, recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.      For public entities, Update 2016-02 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.      The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of Update 2016-02 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) ( Update 2015-11 ), which seeks to simplify the measurement of inventory.      Update 2015-11 requires that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, where net realizable value   is the estimated selling price   in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.      For public entities, the amendments in Update 2015-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.      The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of Update 2015-11 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( Update 2014-09 ), which seeks to provide clarity for recognizing revenue.      Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will supersede the revenue recognition requirement as in Topic 605 Revenue Recognition.      Update 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to those goods or services.      Entities may apply the amendments in Update 2014-09 either (a) retrospectively to each reporting period presented, and the entity may elect a practical expedient per the update, or (b) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying Update 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application   if an entity elects this transition method it also should provide the additional disclosures in reporting periods.      In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)     ( Update 2015-14 ).      Deferral of the Effective Date,   which finalized   proposed ASU No. 2015-240 of the same name and responds to stakeholders  request to defer the effective date   of the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09.

In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( Update 2016-10 ), which clarifies multiple aspects of Topic 606. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( Update 2016-12 ), which provides clarifying guidance in a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance.     For public entities, Upda  te 2014-09, Update 2015-14,   Update 2016-08  , Update 2016-10 and Update 2016-12   are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.      The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of Upd  ate 2014-09, Update 2015-14,   Update 2016-08  , Update 2016-10 and Update 2016-12   and assessing the impact, if any, they may have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The following updates information as to Southwestern Energy Company s financial condition provided in our 2015 Annual Report and analyzes the changes in the results of operations between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  For definitions of commonly used natural gas and oil terms used in this Quarterly Report, please refer to the  Glossary of Certain Industry Terms  provided in our 2015 Annual Report. 

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in the  Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements  in the forepart of this Quarterly Report, in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in Part I and elsewhere in our 2015 Annual Report, and Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in Part II in this Quarterly Report and any other quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed during the fiscal year.  You should read the following discussion with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report. 

OVERVIEW 

Background 

Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively,  we ,  our ,  us  or  Southwestern ) is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and     oil     exploration, development and production, which we refer to as  E P.   We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to as  Midstream.   We conduct most of our businesses through subsidiaries and we operate principally in two segments: E P and Midstream. 

Exploration and Production.    Our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil, with our current operations principally focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas.  Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania, which we refer to as  Northeast Appalachia,  are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale.  Our operations in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania, which we refer to as  Southwest Appalachia,  are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs.  Collectively, we refer to our properties located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia as the  Appalachian Basin.   Our operations in Arkansas are primarily focused on an unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Fayetteville Shale.  We have exploration and production activities ongoing in Colorado and Louisiana, along with other areas in which we are currently exploring for new development opportunities.  We also have drilling rigs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas and provide oilfield products and services, principally serving our E P operations. 

Midstream.        Through our affiliated midstream subsidiaries, we engage in natural gas gathering activities in Arkansas and Louisiana.      These activities primarily support our E P operations and generate revenue from fees associated with the gathering of natural gas.      Our marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of the natural gas, oil and NGLs produced in our E P operations. 

We are focused on providing long-term growth in the net asset value per share of our business.  Historically, the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow has been derived from the production associated with our E P business.  However, beginning in 2015 and continuing through the   first   nine months   of 2016  , depressed commodity prices significantly decreased our E P results   of   operations  .       The price we expect to receive for our production is a   critical factor in the capital investments we make to develop our properties.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we decreased activity in the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale as a result of the lower commodity price environment.  Based on current   forward pricing, along with the successful implementation of our debt reduction strategy, we   began increasing our activity in the third quarter   of 2016.  We expect to continue these operations for the remainder of the year.    Natural gas prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict.      These factors, which include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities, weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas, which in turn determines the sales prices for our production.        W  e   are     also   impacted by crude oil   and NGL   prices  ,   which have   been volatile and have declined significantly along with natural gas prices  .      In addition to the factors identified above, the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices, including basis   differentials  .      The current commodity price environment has resulted in the impairment of a significant portion of our natural gas and oil properties over recent reporting periods  .    Our current expected level of capital investment in the fourth

quarter, along with c  urrent forward pricing  ,     could   result in   an   additional impairment to our natural gas and oil properties in the fourth quarter of 2016 ranging from   approximately $100 million to $300 million,   net of taxes, with material impairments possible beyond the fourth quarter. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

We reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $7  35   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or ($1.5  2  ) per diluted share, compared   to net loss attributable to common stock   of $  1.8     b  illion, or   (  $  4.62)   per diluted share, for the   same period in 2015  .   

Our   natural gas and liquids   production decreased to   211 Bcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2016, down 15% from 249 Bcfe for the   same period in   2015.  The 38 Bcfe decrease was due to a 29 Bcfe decrease in net production from our Fayetteville Shale and other properties and a 9 Bcf decrease   in net production from our Northeast Appalachia   properties.  Net production for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from our Southwest Appalachia properties remained approximately flat, compared to the same period in 2015.  The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of derivatives, decreased 22% to $1.73 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.21 per Mcf for the same period in 2015.  The average price realized for our oil production increased 6% to $35.41 per barrel for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $33.50 per barrel for the same period in 2015.  The average price realized for our NGL production increased 49% to $7.04 per barrel for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4.72 per barrel for the same period in 2015.    We did not use derivatives to financially protect our 2016 or 2015 oil or NGL production. 

Our E P segment reported an operating loss of $7  77   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, down from an operating loss of $2.9 billion for the   same period in   2015.  This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the impairment of natural gas and oil properties to $8  17   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the $2.8 billion impairment recorded for the same period in 2015.  Excluding impairments, our E P segment reported operating income of $  40   million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016  ,    compared to an operating loss   of $71 million   for the same period in 2015,   primarily due   to a $22  1   million decrease in operating costs and expenses and increases in our realized oil and NGL prices, partially offset by a 22%, or $0.48 per Mcf  , decrease in our realized natural gas   price (including derivatives)     and a 38 Bcfe decrease in production  .   

Operating income for our Midstream   segment was $52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, down from $68 million for the   same period in   2015, primarily due to a $26 million decrease in gas gathering revenues and a $2 million decrease in our marketing margin, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in operating costs and expenses.       

Capital investments   were $18  0   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (including $41 million in capitalized interest and $21 million in capitalized   expenses)  ,   of   which $179 million   was invested in   our E P segment, compared to $468   million for the same period   of 201  5,   of which $  461     m  illion was invested in our E P segment. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

We   reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or ($6.0  2  ) per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to common stock of $2.5 billion, or ($6.65) per diluted share, for the   same period in 2015  .   

Our natural gas and   liquids     production decreased to 673 Bcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down 7% from 727 Bcfe for the   same period in   2015.  The 54 Bcfe decrease was due to a 71 Bcfe decrease in net production from our Fayetteville Shale and other properties, partially offset by 12 Bcfe and 5 Bcf increases in net production from our Southwest   Appalachia   and Northeast Appalachia properties, respectively.  The average price realized for our gas production, including the effects of derivatives, decreased 39% to $1.51 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.47 per Mcf for the same period in 2015.  The average price realized for our oil production decreased 19% to $28.53 per barrel for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $35.23 per barrel for the same period in 2015.  The average price realized for our NGL production decreased 5% to $6.11 per barrel for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6.43 per barrel for the same period in 2015.  We did not   use derivatives to   financially protect our 2016 or 2015 oil or NGL production. 

Our E P segment reported   an     operating loss of $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down from an operating loss of $4.5 billion for the   same period in   2015.     The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the impairment of natural gas and oil properties   to $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared  

32   

Table of Contents  

to the $4.4 billion   impairment   recorded for the same pe  riod   in 2015.  Excluding impairments, our E P segment operating loss increased to $16  5   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   from $97 million for the same period in 2015  , primarily due to a 39%, or $0.96 per Mcf, decrease in our realized natural gas price (including derivatives), a 54 Bcfe decrease in production and decreases in our realized oil and NGL prices.  These decreases were partially offset by a $56  7   million decrease in operating costs and expenses. 

Operating income for our Midstream segment   was $169 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down from $511 million for the   same period in   2015, primarily due to a $277 million gain on sale of assets, net in 2015.  Excluding the net gain on sale, our Midstream segment operating income decreased $65 million due to an $88 million decrease in gas gathering revenues and a $9 million decrease in marketing margin, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in operating costs and expenses.  In the second quarter of 2015, we sold our northeastern Pennsylvania and East Texas gathering assets that accounted for $13 million in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  A net gain on these sales of $277 million was recognized and   was   included   in gain on sale of assets, net in the unaudited condensed consolidating statement of operations.  

Capital   investments were $37  6   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (including $123 million in capitalized interest and $62 million in capitalized expenses), of which $372 million was invested in our E P segment, compared to $2.1 billion for the same period of 2015  ,   of which $  1.9     b  illion was invested in our E P segment   (including $635 million, in   total, related to the acquisitions from WPX Energy, Inc. and Statoil ASA)  . 

RESUL    TS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion of our results of operations for our segments is presented before intersegment eliminations.      We evaluate our segments as if they were stand-alone operations and accordingly discuss their results prior to any intersegment eliminations.      Interest expense and income tax expense are discussed on a consolidated basis.

Revenues 

Revenues for our E P   segment were down $110 million, or 23%, for the three   months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015  .    Revenues decreased   by $6  8   million and $50 million as a result   of decreased natural gas production volumes and   hedge settlement proceeds,   respectively, partially offset by an increase of $7 million as a result of increased   pricing and   NGL production and an increase of $1 million for increased realized natural   gas pricing, excluding the effects of derivatives  .      E P revenues   were $998   million for the nine months ended September     30, 2016, down $635 million, or 39%, compared to   the same period in 2015.  A decrease in the price realized  , excluding the effects of derivatives,   from the sale of our natural gas production decreased revenue by $351 million.  Additionally, there was a $145 million decrease in hedge settlement proceeds, a $138 million decrease due to lower natural gas production volumes, and a $15 million decrease as a result of decreased liquid  s   pricing, partially offset by a $1  4   million increase due to increased liquid  s   production volumes.    Natural gas, oil, and NGL prices are difficult to predict and are subject to wide price fluctuations.  Excluding basis swaps  , as of September 30, 2016   we had   protected     100   Bcf of our remaining 201  6   natural gas production to limit our exposure to price fluctuations.      We refer you to    Note 7    to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report and to the discussion of  Commodity Prices  provided below for additional information.      In May 2015, we sold our conventional oil and gas assets located in East Texas and the Arkoma Basin that accounted   for less than $1 million and $15   million of our   natural gas and oil   revenues for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015, respectively  . 

Production 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016  , our   natural gas and liquids   production decreased 15% to 211    B  cfe,   down from   249   Bcfe from the same   period in 2015, and was produced entirely by our properties in the United States.  The 38 Bcfe decrease was primarily due to a 29 Bcfe decrease in net production from our Fayetteville Shale and other properties and a 9 Bcf decrease in net production from   our Northeast Appalachia properties.      N  et production   for the three months ended September 30, 2016   from our   Southwest Appalachia properties remained approximately flat, compared to the same period in 2015  .    Net production from our Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and     Fayetteville Shale   properties was 84 Bcf, 37 Bcfe and 90 Bcf  ,   respectively  ,   for the three months ended September 30, 2016,   compared to   93   Bcf,   37   Bcf  e  , and   118 Bcf  , respectively, for the   same period in 2015  .  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our natural gas and liquids production decreased 7% to 673 Bcfe, down from 727 Bcfe from the same period in 2015, and was produced entirely by our properties in the United States.  The 54 Bcfe decrease was due to a 71 Bcfe decrease in net production from our Fayetteville Shale and other properties, partially offset by 12 Bcfe and 5 Bcf increases in net production from our Southwest   Appalachia   and Northeast Appalachia properties, respectively.  Net production   from our   Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and   Fayetteville Shale   properties   was 268 Bcf, 115 Bcfe and 289   Bcf  ,   respectively,   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   compared to   263   Bcf,   103   Bcf  e  , and   354 Bcf  , respectively, for the   same period in 2015. 

Commodity Prices 

The average price realized for our natural gas production, including the   effects of derivatives, decreased to $1.73 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.21 per Mcf for the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to the   significant benefit from   our derivative program during the three months ended September 30, 201  5,   compared to   a slight loss for   the same period in 201  6  , partially offset by a $0.01 per Mcf increase in the average realized natural gas price, excluding the effects of derivatives.  The average price realized for our natural gas production, excluding the effects of derivatives, increased 1% to $1.78 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  Our derivatives decreased the average realized natural gas price by $0.05 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an increase of $0.44   per Mcf for the same period in 2015.      The average price realized for our natural gas production, including the effects of   derivatives, decreased to $1.51 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.47 per Mcf for the same period in 2015.  The decrease was the result of a $0.58 per Mcf decrease in the average natural gas price, excluding derivatives, and a decrease in proceeds from our derivative program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  The average price realized for our natural gas production, excluding the effects of derivatives, decreased 28% to $1.47 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  Our derivatives increased the average realized natural gas price by $0.04 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an increase of $0.42 per Mcf for the same period in 2015.

Our E P segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a   differential   to average monthly NYMEX settlement prices due to heating content of the gas, locational basis differentials, transportation and fuel charges.      Additionally, we receive a sales price for our oil and NGLs at a   differential   to average monthly West Texas Intermediate settlement and Mont Belvieu NGL composite prices, respectively, due to a number of factors including product quality, composition and types of NGLs sold, locational basis differentials, transportation and fuel charges. 

We enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials.      We refer you to    Item 3   ,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  and    Note 7    to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion   about our derivatives and risk management activities  . 

Excluding the impact of   derivatives  , the average price received for our natural gas production for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     of $1.47 per   Mcf was   approximately $0.82   per Mcf   lower than the   average   monthly NYMEX settlement price, primarily due to locational basis differentials and transportation costs.  We protected   approximately 37  % of our   natural gas production for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from the impact of widening basis   differentials through our   sales arrangements     and   hedging activities  .  For the nine   mo  nths ended September 30, 2016, we   protected the basis   on approximately 216 Bcf of   our natural gas production through physical sales arrangements.      We have protected basis on   approximately   59   Bcf and   120   Bcf of our remaining 2016 and 2017   expected natural gas production through physical sales arrangements at a basis differential to NYMEX natural gas prices of approximately ($0.11) per Mcf and ($0.1  7  ) per Mcf for the remainder of 2016 and 2017, respectively  , and   have also financially protected a portion our remaining 2016 and 2017 expected natural gas production.  We refer you to    Note 7    to the unaudited   condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterl  y Report for additional details about our derivative instruments.    

We realized an average sales   price of $35.41   per barrel for   our oil production   for the three months ended September   30,   2016, up 6% from     $  33.50   per barrel for the same period in 2015.      Oil   accounted for 2% and 1  %   of our total production   for the three months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We realized an average sales price   of $28.53   per barrel fo  r our oil production for the nine months ended September   30  , 2016, down 19% from $35.2  3   per barrel for the same period in 2015.      Oil   accounted   for 2%   and 1% of   our total production for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We did not   use derivatives to   financially protect our 2016 or 2015 oil production.       

We realized an average   sales price of $7.04 per barrel for our NGL production for the three months ended September 30, 2016, up 49% from $4.72 per barrel for the same period in 2015.  NGLs accounted for 9% and 7% of our total production for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We realized an average sales price of $6.11 per barrel for our NGL production for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down 5% from $6.43 per barrel for the same period in 2015.  NGLs accounted for 9% and 7% of our total production for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We did not   use derivatives to   financially protect our   2016 or 2015 NGL production.       

Operating Income  

Our E P segment   reported an   operating loss of $7  77   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, down     from an   operating loss of $2.9 billion for the   same period in   2015.  The E P segment recorded a  n   $8  17   million impairment of natural gas and oil properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a $2.8 billion impairment for the same period in 2015.  Excluding impairments, our E P segment reported operating income of $  40   million for the three months   ended September 30, 2016  ,   compared to an operating loss of $71 million for the same period in 2015,   primarily due to   a $22  1   million decrease   in operating costs and expenses result  ing   primarily   from a $172   million   decrease   in DD A,   a $47   million   decrease   in operating expenses and   a $4 million decrease   in taxes other than   income, partially offset by a $  2   million increase in general and administrative expenses.  Additionally, we had an increase of $8 million as a   result of increased liquids pricing.    These were partially offset   by a 22%, or $0.48 per Mcf, decrease   in our realized natural gas price  ,   including derivatives  , and   a   38 Bcfe decrease in   our production.    For the three months ended September   30, 2016, general and administrative expenses included   $2   million related to restructuring charges.

Table of Contents  

Our   E P segment reported an operating loss of $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down from an operating loss of $4.5 billion for the   same period in     2015.  The E P segment recorded a $2.3 billion impairment of natural gas and oil properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a $4.4 billion impairment for the same period in 2015.    Excluding impairments, our E P segment reported an operating loss of $16  5   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an operating loss of $97 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due to a 39%, or $0.96 per Mcf, decrease in our realized natural gas price  ,   including derivatives, a 54 Bcfe decrease in production and decreases in our realized oil and NGL prices.  These decreases were partially offset by a $56  7   million decrease in operating costs and expenses, resulting primarily from a $524 million decrease in DD A, an $84 million decrease in operating expenses and a $12 million decrease in taxes other than income, partially offset by a $5  4   million increase in general and administrative expenses.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses and taxes other than income inc  luded $71 million and $3 million  , respectively, rel  ated to restructuring charges. 

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Lease opera  ting expenses per Mcfe for the E P segment   were $0.86 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.92   for the same period in 2015  .    Lease operating expenses per Mcfe decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015  ,     primarily due to the successful renegotiation of our existing gathering and processing rates in Southwest Appalachia  .    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   lease operating expenses decreased to $0.87, compared to $0.92 for the same period in 2015.  Lease operating expenses per Mcfe decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015  ,     primarily due to the successful renegotiation of our existing gathering and processing rates in Southwest Appalachia   as well as   decreased workover activity and contract services  . 

Excluding the restructuring charges associated primarily with our workforce reduction, g  eneral and administrative expenses for the E P segment   increased to   $0.23 per   Mcfe for   the three months ended September 30, 2016, co  mpared to $0.20   per Mcf   for the same period in 2015  , as a result of decreased production volumes  .  In total, excluding the 2016 restructuring charges, general and administrative expenses for the E P segment were $50 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .    Including restructuring charges, general and administrative costs for three months ended   September   30, 2016   were $5  2   million   for our E P segment.  F  or the nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,     general and administrative expenses for the E P segment  ,     excluding the restructuring   charges  , were $0.21 per Mcfe, compared to $0.22 per Mcfe for the same period in 2015, primarily due to the decrease in employee costs  , partially offset by decreased production volumes  .  In total, excluding restructuring charges, general and administrative expenses for the E P segment were $14  1   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $158 million for the   same period in   2015.  Including restructuring charges, general and administrative costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $21  2   million   for our E P segment.  

Taxes other than income   taxes per Mcfe were $0.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015.  Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.09 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (excluding $3 million related to restructuring charges), compared to $0.11 for the same period in 2015.  Taxes other than income taxes per   Mcfe vary from period to period due to changes in   ad valorem and   severance taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. 

Our full cost pool amortization rate   averaged $0.35 per Mcfe   and   $0.98 per Mcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015  ,   respectively, and   $0.40 per Mcfe   and   $1.08 per Mcfe for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015  ,   respectively  .    The decreases in the average amortization rates resulted primarily from our full cost ceiling impairments over the respective periods.    The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and   the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write-downs that result from full cost ceiling   impairments  , proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the level of costs subject to amortization.  We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability   of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the am  ount of future reserve changes.   

Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $  2.2 billion at September   30, 2016, compared to $3.7 billion at December 31,   2015.  The decrease in unevaluated costs primarily resulted from the   evaluation of a portion of our Southwest Appalachia assets, of which 55,000 net acres were sold to Antero Resources Corporation   during the third quarter of 2016  , along with the evaluation of a portion of our New Ventures assets  .

Revenues 

Revenues from our marketing activities were down 6% to $591 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and were down 24% to $1,571 million   for the nine months ended September   30, 2016  ,   compared to the same period in 2015.      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the volumes marketed decreased 8% and the price received for volumes marketed increased 3%, compared to the same period in 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the price received for volumes decreased 22% and     the volumes marketed decreased 3%  , compared to the same period in 2015  .  Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity price  s are largely offset by corresponding changes in marketing purchase expenses.  Of the total natural gas volumes marketed, production from our affiliated E P operated wells   accounted for 91% and 97% of the natural gas marketed volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, production from our affiliated E P operated wells accounted for 94% and   97%, respectively  , of our total natural gas volumes marketed  .      Our Midstream segment marketed   approximately 63% and 64% of our combined oil and NGL production for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 65% and   58  % of our combined oi  l and NGL production for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Revenues from our gathering activities were down 22% to $91 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and down 23% to $291 million   for the nine months ended September   30, 2016  ,   compared to the same period in 2015.    The decrease in the gathering   revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the decreased volumes in the Fayetteville Shale.  The decrease in gathering revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to decreased volumes in the Fayetteville Shale and the divestiture of our northeast Pennsylvania and East Texas gathering assets in 2015  .  The divested gathering assets accounted for $21 million of our gathering revenues for the   nine months ended September   30,   2015. 

Operating Income 

Operating income from   our Midstream segment decreased to $52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $68 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due   to   a $26 million decrease in gas gathering revenues and a $2 million decrease in marketing margin, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in operating costs and expenses.  Operating income decreased to $169 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $511 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due to a $277 gain on sale of assets, net in 2015.  Excluding the net gain on sale, our Midstream segment operating income decreased 28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to an $88 million decrease in gas gathering revenues and a $9 million decrease in marketing margin, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in operating costs and expenses.  The divested northeastern Pennsylvania and East Texas gathering assets accounted for $13 million of our operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    

The margin generated from marketing activities   was $13 million and $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  .  The margin generated from marketing activities was $38 million   and $47 million for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Margins are driven primarily by volumes marketed and may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities.  We enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our natural gas marketing activities to provide   margin protection.    For more information about our derivatives and risk management activities, we   refer you to    Item 3   ,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  included in this Quarterly Report for additional information. 

Restructuring Charges 

In January 2016, we announced a 40% workforce reduction that was substantially concluded by the end of March 2016.    In April 2016, we also partially restructured executive management.    Affected employees were offered a severance package   that   included a one-time   cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, accelerated vesting of outstanding stock-based   equity awards.  As a result of the workforce reduction and executive management restructuring, we recognized restructuring charges of $2 million and $77 million   for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016  , respectively  . 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense, net of capitalization,   was $  26   million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to no interest expense, net of capitalization, for the same peri  od in 2015, and $  57 million for the nine months ended September   30, 2016, compared to $52 million for the same period in 2015.      Gross interest   expense increased to $67 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $53 million for the same period in 2015, primarily   due to an increase in our cost of debt.   Included in the gross interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is $6 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with extinguished debt.        For the nine month  s ended September   30, 2016, gross i  nterest   expense increased to $180 million, up from   $160 million for the same period in   2015, excluding a $  47   million charge for unamortized fees associated with the repayment of our bridge facility in the first quarter of 2015.    Included in the gross interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $6 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with extinguished debt.    We capitalized   interest of $41 million and $53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and capitalized interest of $123 million   and $155 million for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    The decrease in capitalized   interest for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2016  ,   compared to the same periods in 2015  ,   was primarily due to the evaluation of a portion of our Southwest Appalachia assets acquired in December 2014. 

Gain (Loss) on Derivatives 

In   general, our   derivatives   are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in gain (loss) on derivatives.      We recorded a $  71   million net   gain   on our derivatives   for the three months ended September   30, 2016  ,   consisting of a  n     $  81   million   gain   on unsettled derivatives  ,   partially   offset by a $10 million loss on   settled derivatives.    For the three months ended September   30, 2015, we recorded   a $15   million net gain on our derivatives, consisting of a $  49   million gain on settled derivatives, partially offset by a $  34   million loss on unsettled derivativ  es.      We   recorded a $28 million net loss on our derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisting of a $48 million loss on unsettled derivatives, partially offset by a $20 million gain on settled derivatives.  For the nine months ended September   30, 2015, we recorded a $  30   million net gain on our derivatives  , consisting of a     $  135   million gain on settled derivatives  ,   partially offset by a $  105   million loss on unsettled derivatives.  We refer you to    Note 7    to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional detail  s   about our gain (loss) on derivatives.  In general and without consideration of volatility or duration, as natur  al gas prices increase from September   30, 2016 levels, we will recognize losses in future periods and, likewise, as natu  ral gas prices decline from September   30, 2016 levels, we will recognize gains in future periods on our derivative contracts not   designated for   hedge accounting   treatment   prior to settlement. 

Loss on   Early Extinguishment of Debt 

During the   third   quarter of 2016,   we   used proceeds from   our     $  1,247     m  illion   July   2016   equity offering   to purchase and retire   $700 million of our outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018 and retire $375 million of our $750 million term loan     entered into in November 2015  .        For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we   recognized a loss of $  51   million for   the   redemption of   these   senior notes, which included $  50   million of premiums paid.    Unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with the extinguished debt totaled $6 million and were included in other interest charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    In September 2016,   we used $48 million of the proceeds received from the   West Virginia   asset sale to Antero Resources Corporation to further decrease the balance of the term loan entered into in November 2015.

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was   approximately   3% and 1%   for the   three and nine months ended September   30, 2016, respectively  , and 38% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  We recorded an income tax benefit   of     $  20     m  illion   for the three and nine months ended September   30, 201  6, and a     $  1.1     b  illion   and $1.5 billion income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2015  , respectively  .  The   low e  ffective income tax rate at September   30, 2016 was the result of our recognition of a valuation allowance   that reduced   the deferred tax asset primarily related to our current net operating loss carryforward.  A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

LIQUID    ITY AND CAPI    TAL RESOURCES 

We depend primarily on internally generated funds, our cash and cash equivalents balance, our $809 million revolving credit facilities and capital markets as our primary sources of liquidity. 

During the first nine months of 2016, we took significant steps in managing our maturities and liquidity.  In June 2016, we entered into amendments of our bank credit facilities, which had the effect of extending the maturities by two   years until late 2020  .      The maturity date will accelerate to October 2019 if, by that date,   we have   not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least $765   million   of   our   2020 Senior Notes.      In July 2016, we completed   a public offering of 98,900,000 shares of our common stock, with net proceeds totaling approximately $1,247 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses.  Of the funds received from the common stock offering, $375 million was used to pay down a portion of our $750 million term loan     entered into in November 2015   and   $750 million   was   used to settle certain tender offers by purchasing an aggregate principal amount of approximately $700 million of our outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018.  The repayment of $375 million on the $750 million term loan had the effect of extending its maturity date to December 2020, which   will accelerate to October 2019 if, by that date,   we   ha  ve   not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least $765   million   of   our   2020 Senior Notes.      In September 2016,   we completed the sale of   55,000 net acres in West Virginia for $426 million   to Antero Resources Corporation, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, and used $48 million of the proceeds to further decrease the balance of the term loan entered into in November 2015.  A portion of the remaining funds from the equity issuance and the sale of the West Virginia acreage enabled us to increase our capital activity.  

In the first half of 2016, we decreased activity in the Appalachian Basin and Fayetteville Shale as a result of the commodity price environment.  After the successful implementation of our debt reduction strategy, we began increasing our activity   in third quarter   of 2016, which will continue throughout the remainder of the year.    Although we have the financial flexibility to draw on the funds available under our revolving credit facility as necessary, we are committed to our capital discipline strategy of investing within our cash flow from operations, supplemented by   the remaining funds from the July 2016 equity issuance and asset sale in West Virginia  .    We refer you to    Note 10    of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report and the section below under  Financing Requirements  for additional discussion of our credit facilities. 

We believe that our operating cash flow and available cash and cash equivalents along with our funds under our revolving credit facilities will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for the remainder of 2016.  The credit status of the financial institutions participating in our revolving credit facilities could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the revolving credit facilities.  Although we believe all of the lenders under the facilities have the ability to provide funds, we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet their obligation to us.  We refer you to the section below under  Financing Requirements  for additional discussion of our compliance with the covenants of our term loans and revolving credit facilities.

Net cash provided by operating activities   decreased 73% to $337 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down from $1,227 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due   to a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working c  apital accounts.  During the nine months ended September   30, 2016, requirements for our capital investments were funded primarily from our cash generated by operating activities,   cash and cash equivalents,   net proceeds from borrowings under   our 2013 revolving credit facility and   commercial paper  .  N  et cash generated from operating activities   provided 89%   of our cash requirements for cap  ital investments     for the nine months ended September   30, 2016,   compared to 60% for the same period in 2015, reflecting our commitment to   our capital discipline strategy of investing within our cash flow from operations  , supplemented by the recent equity issuance and asset sales, during the current commodity price environment. 

Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the sales prices that we receive for our natural gas and liquids production.  Natural gas, oil and NGL prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand, which is impacted by many factors.  The sales price we receive for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities.  See  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks  in    Item 3    and    Note 7    to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for further details.  Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction.  We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions.  However, any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities. 

Additionally, our short-term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and joint interest partners.  We actively manage this risk through credit management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced any significant write-offs for non-collectable amounts.  However, any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and joint interest partners could adversely impact our cash flows.  

Due to these above factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations.  Accordingly, we w  ill adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow.  Further, we may from time to time seek to retire or rearrange some or all of our outstanding debt or preferred stock through cash purchases, and/or exchanges, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.  Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 

Capital Investments 

Our capital investments   were $37  6   million and $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Capital investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $635 million, in total, related to acquisitions from WPX Energy, Inc. and Statoil ASA.  Our E P segment investments were $372 million   and $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our E P segment capitalized internal costs   of $78 million   for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 compared to $  244   million for the   same   period in 2015.  These internal costs were directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities and are included as part of the cost of natural gas and oil properties. 

The remaining funds, after debt reduction, from the equity issuance and West Virginia acreage sale enabled us to supplement our 2016 capital budget, allowing us the opportunity to complete many of our drilled but uncompleted wells and resume drilling on our high PVI projects.      Although our 2016 capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations along with our cash and cash equivalents, we have the financial flexibility to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. 

Financing Requirements 

Our total debt outstanding was $4.7 billion at September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015.    Our   total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $3.2 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2015.  Our efforts to reduce our total debt outstanding are further discussed below. 

At October 18, 2016, we had a long-term issuer credit rating of Ba3 by Moody s, a long-term debt rating of BB- by S P and a long-term issuer default rating of BB by Fitch Ratings.  Any downgrades in our public debt ratings by Moody s or S P could increase our cost of funds and decrease our   liquidity under our revolving credit facilities.

At September 30, 2016, our capital structure   consisted of   74  % net debt     (including $  1.5 b  illion in cash and cash equivalents)   and   26  % equity, compared to 67% net debt     (including $15 million in cash and cash equivalents)   and 33% equity at December 31, 2015. 

In July 2016, we consummated an underwritten offering of 98,900,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with net proceeds of the offering totaling approximately $1,247 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses.  The proceeds from the offering were used to repay $375 million of the $750 million term loan entered into in November 2015 and to settle certain tender offers by purchasing an aggregate principal amount of approximately $700 million of our outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018.  The remaining net proceeds of the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of wells already drilled or the funding of other capital projects. 

In June 2016, we reduced our existing $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to $66 million and entered into a new credit agreement for $1,934 million, consisting of a $1,191 million secured term loan and a new unsecured $743 million revolving credit facility, which   matures   i  n December 2020.      The maturity date will accelerate to October 2019 if, by that date,   we have   not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least $765   million   of   our   2020 Senior Notes.    The $1,191 million secured term loan is fully drawn, with approximately $285 million of this balance used to pay down the previous revolving credit   facility bala  nce in   its entirety.  As of September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings under either revolving credit facility; however, there was $174 million   in letters of credit outstanding against the 2016 revolving credit facility.   

Loans under the 2016 credit agreement are subject to varying rates of interest based on whether the loan is a Eurodollar loan or an alternate base rate loan.  Eurodollar loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate, which is adjusted LIBOR plus applicable margins ranging from 1.750% to 2.500%.  Alternate base rate loans bear interest at the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin ranging   from 0.750% to 1.500%.    The interest rate on the term loan facility is determined based upon our public debt ratings and was 250 basis   points over LIBOR as of September 30, 2016. 

Our 2016 credit agreement contains financial covenants that impose certain restrictions on us.  Under our revolving credit and term loan facilities, we must keep a minimum interest coverage of 0.75x in 2016, increasing by 0.25x increments per year to 1.50x in 2019 and 2020.  We are also subject to a minimum liquidity requirement of $300 million, which could be increased up to $500 million upon certain conditions, as well as an anti-hoarding provision, requiring unrestricted cash in excess of $100 million to pay down any amounts borrowed under the new revolving credit facility.  The financial covenant with respect to minimum interest coverage consists of EBITDAX divided by consolidated interest expense.  EBITDAX   excludes the effects of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, any non-cash impacts from impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on asset sales, unamortized issuance cost, unamortized debt discount and certain restructuring costs.  Collateral for the new secured term loan is principally our E P properties in the Fayetteville Shale area.  This collateral also may support all or a part of revolving credit extensions depending on restrictions in our senior notes indentures, and requires a minimum collateral coverage ratio of 1.50x. 

The existing unsecured 2013 revolving credit facility includes a financial covenant under which we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total adjusted book capital.  This financial covenant with respect to capitalization percentages excludes the effects of any full cost ceiling impairments, certain hedging activities and our pension and other postretirement liabilities. 

In November 2015, we entered into a $750 million unsecured three-year term loan credit agreement with various lenders that was used to repay borrowings under the existing revolving credit   facility.  The interest rate on the term loan facility is determined based upon our public debt ratings from   Moody s and   S P   and was 250 basis     points over   LIBOR as of September   30, 2016.  The term loan facility requires prepayment under certain circumstances from the net cash proceeds of sales of equity or certain assets and borrowings outside the ordinary course of business.  In June   2016, the 2015 term loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity date, pending a certain repayment threshold.  As a result of our July 2016 equity offering, we repaid $375 million of the $750 million term loan, which had the effect of extending its maturity from November 2018 to December 2020  .      The maturity date will accelerate to October 2019 if, by that date,   we have   not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least $765   million   of   our   2020 Senior Notes.    In September 2016, we repaid an additional $48 million of the term loan with proceeds from the sale of our West Virginia acreage.  

A  s of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the term loans and revolving credit facilities.  Although we do not anticipate any violations of the financial covenants, our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and liquids.

Table of Contents  

In January 2015, we completed concurrent underwritten public offerings of 30,000,000 shares of common stock and 34,500,000 depositary shares (both share counts include shares issued as a result of the underwriters exercising their options to purchase additional shares).  Net proceeds from the offerings totaled approximately $2.3 billion after underwriting discount and expenses.  Each depositary share represents a 1/20th interest in a share of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to a $50 liquidation preference per depositary share).  The proceeds from the offerings were used to partially repay borrowings under a $4.5 billion 364-day bridge facility that we entered into in December 2014 in connection with our acquisition of assets in Southwest Appalachia, with the remaining balance fully repaid with proceeds from our January 2015 public offering of $2.2 billion in senior notes. 

The mandatory convertible preferred stock entitles the holders to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of the convertible preferred stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights.  Dividends are to be paid at a rate of 6.25% per annum on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and can be paid in cash, common stock or a combination of both.  Unless converted earlier at the option of the holders, on or around January 15, 2018 each share of convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into between 37.0028 and 43.4782 shares of our common stock (and, correspondingly, each depositary share will convert into between 1.85014 and 2.17391 shares of our common stock), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, depending on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock over a 20 trading-day period immediately prior to that date. 

Our mandatory convertible preferred stock has the non-forfeitable right to participate on an as-converted basis at the conversion rate then in effect in any common stock dividends declared and as such, is considered a participating security.  As such, it is included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, pursuant to the two-class method.  In the calculation of basic earnings per share attributable to common shareholders, participating securities are allocated earnings based on actual dividend distributions received plus a proportionate share of undistributed net income attributable to common shareholders, if any, after recognizing distributed earnings.  

In January 2015, we completed a public offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.30% senior notes due 2018 (the  2018 Notes ), $850 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.05% senior notes due 2020 (the  2020 Notes ) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.95% senior notes due 2025 (the  2025 Notes  and together with the 2018 and 2020 Notes, the  Notes ), with net proceeds from the offering totaling approximately $2.2 billion after underwriting discounts and offering expenses.  The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to repay all principal and interest remaining outstanding under our $4.5 billion 364-day bridge facility, which was first reduced with proceeds from our concurrent underwritten public offerings of common stock and depositary shares.  Proceeds from the sale of the Notes were also used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility.  The Notes were sold to the public at a price of 99.949% of their face value for the 2018 Notes, 99.897% of their face value for the 2020 Notes and 99.782% of their face value for the 2025 Notes.  The interest rates on the Notes are determined based on our public bond ratings from Moody s and S P.  Downgrades on the Notes from either rating agency increase our interest   costs by 25 basis points per downgrade level on the following semi-annual bond interest payment.  Based on the February and June 2016 downgrades from Moody s and S P, our interest rates on these Notes increased by 175 basis points in July 2016.  In July     2016  ,     we used a portion of the proceeds from the July 2016 equity offering to settle certain   tender offer  s     by purchasing an aggregate principal amount of approximately $700 million of our outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018. 

Our derivative contracts allow us to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations.  Excluding basis swaps, at October 18, 2016, we had commodity price derivatives in place on 99 Bcf of our remaining targeted 2016 natural gas production, and 535 Bcf and 160 Bcf on our targeted 2017 and 2018 natural gas production, respectively.  We also had commodity derivatives in place on 365 MBbls of our targeted ethane production for 2017 and 2018.  The amount of long-term debt we incur will be largely dependent upon   commodity prices and our capital investment plans. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material   off-balance sheet obligations.    As of   September 30, 2016  , our material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements.  There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of our capital resources.  For more information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements, we refer you to  Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments  in our   2015   Annual Report.

Table of Contents  

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 

We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing   activities.    Other than the firm transportation and gathering agreements discussed below, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report.    

Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 

As of September 30, 2016, our contractual obligations for demand and similar charges under firm transportation and   gathering agreements to guarantee access capacity on natural gas and liquids pipelines and gathering systems totaled approximately $  8.6 billion, $3.4   billion of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and/or additional construction efforts.  This amount also included guarantee obligations of up to   $862   million.      As of September   30, 2016, future payments under non-cancelable firm transportation and gathering agreements are as follows:  

Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans.    For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we have   contributed $  8   million   to the pension   and postretirement benefit   plan  s.  We expect to contribute an additional $3 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans during the remainder of 2016.      As of     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,   we recognized liabilit  ies     of   $52 million   and $51 million, respectively, as a   result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  .  See    Note 12    to   the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion   about our pension and other postretirement benefits. 

We are subject to litigation, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business  , such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties and pollution, contamination or nuisance.  Management believes that   such lit  igation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to   have a material adverse impact on our financial   position, results of operations or cash flows.  Many of   these matters are   in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all   subjec  t to inherent uncertainties; therefore,   management s view may change in the future.      If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.      We accrue for such items when a liability is both probable and the amou  nt can be reasonably estimated.    For further information, we refer you to  Legal Proceedings  in Item 1 of Part II of this Quarterly Report.  

We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.  Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated.  Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.   

Working Capital  

We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our   cash and cash equivalents and our   revolving credit facilit  ies,   described in  Financi  ng     Requirements  above.  We had positive working capital of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2016 and negative working capital of $314 million at December 31, 2015.  The positive working capital as of September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents resulting from our new term loan   and proceeds from the sale of our West Virginia acreage  .  The negative working capital as of December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in derivative assets in 2015.

ITEM 3. Q    UANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations.  We use fixed price swap agreements, fixed price options, basis swaps and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and interest rates.  Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk.  Utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.  These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. 

Credit Risk 

Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading.  Concentrations of credit risk   with   respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our purchasers and their dispersion across geographic areas.  No single purchaser accounted for greater than 10% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  See  Commodities Risk  below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading. 

Interest Rate Risk 

At September     30, 2016, we had approximately $3.2 billion of outstanding senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of   5.68  %   and   $1  .5     b  illion of term loan facility debt with a variable interest rate of 2.9  6  %  .    We   currently have an interest rate swap in effect to mitigate a portion of our exposure to volatility in interest rates. 

(1) 

Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts  .     

(2) 

The maturity date will accelerate to October 2019 if, by that date,   we have   not amended, redeemed or refinanced at least $765   million   of   our   2020 Senior Notes  .     

Commodities Risk 

We use over-the-counter fixed price swap agreements and options to protect sales of our production against the inherent risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market.  These swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps) and transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps).  For additional information on our derivatives and risk management, see    Note 7    in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas.  However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas that is financially protected.  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties.  The counterparties are primarily major banks and integrated energy companies that management believes present minimal credit risks.  The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure.  Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable.  We have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non-performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently.  However, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future.

Ite    m 4. Controls and   Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that we have designed to ensure that we record, process, accumulate and communicate information to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and submission within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those determined to be effective can provide only a level of reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  Based on the evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016 at a reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.    

Refer to    Litigation    and  Environmental Risk    in    Note 11    to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of the Company s legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  .    

Other than the following additional risk factor, there   were no additions or material changes to   our   risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A of Part I in the Company s 201  5   Annual Report. 

Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. 

The elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies has been proposed in recent years by members of the U.S. Congress and by the President in his fiscal year 2017 budget proposal.  These changes have included, among other proposals: 

repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties;     

elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs;     

elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities; and     

extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.     

In addition, the President s fiscal year 2017 budget proposal includes the imposition of a new $10.25 per barrel fee on certain oil production, to be paid by certain oil companies (without precise details regarding the implementation of such fee).  It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted.  The passage of these or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws to eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 CEO CERTIFICATION - SECTION 302

Exhibit 31.1       Exhibit 31.1    CERTIFICATION                            I, William J. Way, certify that:                1. I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Southwestern Energy Company;                           2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;                           3.

The table that follows reflects citations, orders, violations and proposed assessments issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (the  MSHA ) to SWN Production (Arkansas), LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Southwestern Energy Company.  The disclosure is with respect to the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Due to timing and other factors, the data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by the MSHA at www.MSHA.gov.

Unless otherwise indicated, any of these other items associated with a single mine have been aggregated in the totals for that mine.                                 (2)              The whole-dollar amounts included are the total dollar value of proposed or outstanding assessments received from MSHA on or before September 30, 2016 regardless of whether the assessment has been challenged or appealed, for alleged violations occurring during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are sometimes reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders, and proposed assessments vary by inspector and also vary depending on the size and type of the operation.
