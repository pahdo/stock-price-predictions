  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

1.  
  ORGANIZATION  
   
 Taxus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (formerly Little Neck Health Connection, Inc.) (the  Company ) is a New York Corporation organized on January 2, 2002.  The Company is a specialty retailer, located in Little Neck, New York, selling vitamins, minerals, herbs, supplements, sports nutrition items and other health and wellness products. 
   
 On August 5, 2014, the sole stockholder (the  Seller ) of the Company entered into an Agreement with an outside individual (the  Buyer ) pursuant to which he sold all of the Company s outstanding common stock.  The purchase price was $105,000.   
   
 On September 22, 2014, the Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name to Taxus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. and increase the number of authorized shares to 1,500,000,000, with par value $0.00001 per share.  The Company has issued 80,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share on September 30, 2014, and issued 1,500,000 shares at $0.001 per share in October 2014. 
   
 On September 10, 2015, Mr. Jiayue Zhang, the sole officer and director and the largest shareholder of the Company, transferred his 41,619,800 shares of common stock of the Company which represents 51.07% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company, to Shanxi Taxus Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, a Chinese limited liability company ( Shanxi Taxus ). Mr. Jiayue Zhang is also the general manager, director and controlling equity owner of Shanxi Taxus. Therefore, upon the completion of the share transfer, Mr. Zhang is still the beneficial owner of the 41,619,800 shares of common stock of the Company.  
   
  2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   
  Basis of Accounting and Presentation   
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting.   
   
 The unaudited interim financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the SEC which apply to interim financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements.  In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented.

  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Basis of Accounting and Presentation (Continued)  
   
 The interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company s Form 10-k filed with the SEC.  The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or for the year ending June 30, 2016. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents.   
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
  The Company s revenues are primarily derived from the sales of vitamins, minerals, herbs, supplements, sports nutrition items and other health and wellness products. Revenue recognition policies comply with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605,    Revenue Recognition   , when persuasive evidence of arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  
   
  Concentration of Credit Risk  
   
 The Company maintains its cash accounts at a commercial bank.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insures up to $250,000 per bank for substantially all depository accounts.  At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have cash balances which were in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.

  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share  
   
 The Company computes net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  ( ASC 260 ).  Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of any dilutive shares outstanding during the period.  Potential dilutive shares are not included when the Company has a loss because their inclusion would be antidilutive. Accordingly, the number of weighted average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net (loss) per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations for the periods reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no dilutive shares outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Section 740,  Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 
   
 The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Section 740-10, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  The guidance also prescribes direction on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties in the financial statements and related disclosures. The Company classifies interest and any related penalties related to income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense.  No interest or penalties have been recognized as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
   
 Management has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company s financial statements as of September 30, 2016.  The Company does not expect any significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date.

2.  
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Fair Value  
   
 FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement , specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs).  In accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy: 
   
 Level 1 Inputs   Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. 
   
 Level 2 Inputs   Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. 
   
 Level 3 Inputs   Inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements. 
   
 FASB ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements.  When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurements.  Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.   
   
 The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented at fair value on a recurring basis.  The carrying value of non-derivative financial instruments including cash, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their fair values due to their short term nature.  
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Inventory  
   
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using a weighted average method which approximates first-in, first-out ( FIFO ).  The Company marks down its inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about the age of the inventory, future demand and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory markdowns may be required.  There were no inventory markdowns for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
  Property and Equipment  
   
 Property and equipment are stated at cost.  The cost of property and equipment was depreciated over their estimated useful lives.  Depreciation was computed on the straight-line method for both financial reporting and income tax purposes.  The estimated useful life for furniture and fixtures was three years.  All assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.

  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  
   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows. 
   
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)  
   
 In May, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, to allow entities to exclude amounts collected from customers from all sales taxes from the transaction price, to specify the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception, variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration, and clarification on contract modifications at transition. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09. 
   
 In April, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the aspects of identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementing guidance, while retaining the related principles within those areas. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09.In March 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2015-03   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). This ASU addressed the simplification of debt issuance costs presentation by presenting debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
   
 In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus net), which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that improved the operability and understandability of implementation guidance versus agent considerations by clarifying the determination of principal versus agent. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect on the financial statements. 
   
 In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2015-17- Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU addressed the simplification of the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position.

  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)  
   
 The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.

  COMMITMENTS  
   
 In August 2016, the Company entered into a new lease, effective on August 1, 2016 to July 31, 2018, with an unrelated third party. The lease provides for renewal options for a period of two years. The old lease was terminated on July 31, 2016. Future minimum rental payments under the lease subsequent to September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

Total rent expense charged to operations was $5,099 and $10,587 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
  7.    INCOME TAXES  
   
 The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following for the three months ended September 30:

7.    INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)  
   
 Deferred tax assets (liabilities) are comprised of the following:  

At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $626,000 of Federal net operating carryforward losses that may be available to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire through 2036. The amount and availability of prior net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to limitations set forth by the Internal Revenue Code.   
   
 The Company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. Management believes that it is more likely than not that future benefits of the deferred tax asset will not be realized principally due to its continuing operating losses and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. 
   
  8.   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company continues to incur net losses from its operations.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  
   
 While management is attempting to execute its strategy, the Company does not have the cash to support the Company s daily operations and requires significant additional capital contributions from one of its major shareholders.  While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase sales volume and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, further implement its business plan and to eventually generate sufficient revenues and net income to meet its obligations.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company is operating a retail store, located in Little Neck, New York, selling dietary supplement products such as vitamins, minerals, calcium, fibers, and proteins, etc. 
   
 On September 22, 2014, the Company filed the amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name to Taxus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. and increased the number of authorized shares to 1,5000,000,000 and changed the par of each share to each share to $0.00001. The Company sold 80,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share on September 30, 2016 and sold 1,500,000 shares at $0.001 per share on October 14, 2014. 
   
 The Company filed a registration statement on form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration and resale of 1,500,000 shares at $0.10 per share. The proceeds from the sale of these shares will go to the selling shareholders. The Company will receive no proceeds. 
   
   Plan of Operation   
   
  The Company plans to open more retail stores in the Borough of Queens, New York City, New York. The new stores will be selling the same   dietary supplement products   that the current store is selling, including   vitamins, minerals, and proteins. In order to open new stores, the Company needs to find new locations appropriate for dietary supplement stores, negotiate leases with the potential landlords, hire additional managers to operate the new stores, and purchase more merchandise for the new stores  inventory. So far the Company is still searching for a suitable new location. The Company has not been able to develop a time frame on when it will find the suitable new location. Besides, the Company has not made any plan to raise the funds necessary to expand the operations. Therefore, there is the possibility that the Company may not be able to open any new stores or at all if the Company cannot find the suitable new locations and cannot raise the necessary funds for the business expansion.  
   
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies.  We believe that understanding the  

18 

basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 The Company s revenues are primarily derived from the sales of vitamins, minerals, herbs, supplements, sports nutrition items and other health and wellness products. Revenue recognition policies comply with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of services has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonable assured. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 The Company s stockholder has elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, wherein the Company s income is taxed directly to the stockholder. Thus, there is no provision or liability for Federal or state income taxes reflected in the accompanying financial statements. The Company s 2015, 2014 and 2013 tax years are open and subject to examination by the taxing authorities.  
   
 The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (the  FASB ASC ) 740-10-25,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.  Under FASB ASC 740-10-25, an organization must recognize the tax benefits associated with tax positions taken for tax return purposes when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. The Company does not believe there are any material uncertain tax positions and, accordingly, it did not recognize any liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
   
  Inventory  
   
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using a weighted average method which approximates first-in, first-out ( FIFO ). The Company marks down its inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about the age of the inventory, future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory markdowns may be required. There were no inventory markdowns for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Results of Operations   
   
  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
   
 The following table sets forth information from our unaudited statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Revenues  
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we generated $ 5,488  of revenues, significantly decreased compared to revenues of $18,275 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Such decrease was mainly due to that the neighboring fitness center was closed and therefore we lost main customer sources.  
   
  Cost of Revenues  
   
 Our cost of revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $ 4,117 , significantly decreased compared to $12,792 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Such decrease was mainly due to that the neighboring fitness center was closed and therefore we lost main customer sources and therefore, the volume of our sales and the products sold dropped significantly. 
   
  Gross Profit  
   
 As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit decreased from $5,483 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $ 1,371  for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in gross profit is mainly due to that the neighboring fitness center was closed and therefore we lost main customer sources and therefore, the volume of our sales and the products sold dropped significantly. 
   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 our total selling, general and administrative expenses were decreased to $ 40,517 , as compared to $68,343 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of selling, general and administrative expenses is due to the decrease in professional services and the decrease in rent in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

20 

Net Loss  
   
 We had a net loss of $ 39,146  for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased from a net loss of $68,343 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss is due to the decrease in our gross profit and the decrease of our operating expenses. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

As of September 30, 2016 we had cash of $ 6,873  in our bank accounts. 
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we used net cash of $ 22,437  in operating activities, compared to the net cash of $85,694 used in operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net cash used in the operating activities was mainly due to the decrease in our sales and our operating expenses. 
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we received net cash of $ 0  in financing activities, as compared to net cash received of  $130,000 in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to that we did not receive additional capital contribution from our sole director and officer Mr. Jiayue Zhang. 
   
 Our net cash decreased by $22,437 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash increase of $44,306 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to that we did not receive the additional capital contribution sole director and Officer Mr. Jiayue Zhang in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cash during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the additional capital contribution we received from our sole director and Officer Mr. Jiayue Zhang in the three months ended September 30, 2015.

    Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).  Based on the evaluation performed, our management concluded that during the period covered by this report, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective based on those criteria and due to the deficiency described below. 
   
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our management identified a material weakness in our controls and procedures regarding our failure to timely prevent loan transactions made to related parties in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Section 402 ).  
   
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
   
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) have concluded, based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2016, that the design and operation of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )) were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated, recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding whether or not disclosure is required due to the deficiency described above. 
   
   Changes in internal control over financial reporting   
   
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. However, our management is currently seeking resolutions to improve our controls and procedures in an effort to remediate the deficiency described above. 
     
    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  
   
      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
   
 We are not aware of any legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which our property is the subject. None of our directors, officers, affiliates, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of our voting securities, or any associate of any such director, officer, and affiliate or security holder are (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceedings, or (ii) have a material interest adverse to us in any legal proceedings. We are not aware of any other legal proceedings that have been threatened against us.
