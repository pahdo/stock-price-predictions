TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Presentation   All references to Tribune Media Company or Tribune Company in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements encompass the historical operations of Tribune Media Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ). 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  In the opinion of management, the financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to state fairly the financial position of the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and the results of operations and cash flows for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . All adjustments reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which management believes necessary to state fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows, have been reflected and are of a normal recurring nature. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  
  On April 16, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ) approved the change of the Company s fiscal year end from the last Sunday in December of each year to December 31 of each year and to change the Company s fiscal quarter end to the last calendar day of each quarter. This change in fiscal year end was effective with the Company s second fiscal quarter of 2015, which ended on June 30, 2015. 
  Change in Accounting Principles   In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 prospectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and present all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowances as of December 31, 2015, as noncurrent on the Company s audited     Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  In   April 2015  , the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  and in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update).  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 retrospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and presented debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of an associated debt liability, with the exception of debt issuance costs related to the Company s Revolving Credit Facility which continue to be presented as an asset and amortized over the appropriate term. As a result of this reclassification, the carrying value of the Company s debt as of December 31, 2015 decreased by   $50 million   (see Note   7   for additional information). 
  Broadcast Rights   The Company amortizes its broadcast rights costs over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the timing of the usage and benefit from such programming. Newer licensed/acquired programming and original produced programming are generally amortized on an accelerated basis as the episodes are aired. For certain categories of licensed programming and feature films that have been exploited through previous cycles, amortization expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. The Company also has commitments for network and sports programming that are expensed on a straight-line basis as the programs are available to air. Management s judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, and includes analyses of historical and estimated future revenue and ratings patterns for similar programming. The Company regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its revenue estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization. Amortization of broadcast rights are expensed to programming in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company carries its broadcast rights at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company evaluates the net realizable value of broadcast rights on a daypart, series, or title-by-title basis, as appropriate. Changes in management s intended usage of a specific daypart, series, or program would result in a reassessment of the net realizable value, which could result in an impairment. The Company determines the net realizable value and estimated fair value, as appropriate, based on a projection of the estimated advertising revenues and carriage/retransmission revenues, less certain direct costs of delivery, expected to be generated by the program material, all of which are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. If the Company s estimates of future revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or impairment adjustments may be required. The Company assesses future seasons of syndicated programs that the Company is committed to acquire for impairment as they become available to the Company for airing. Any impairments of programming rights are expensed to programming in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with broadcast rights, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $  37   million for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America in the third quarter of 2016. 
  As a result of an updated analysis completed in the first quarter of 2016, the Company updated its amortization model for certain categories of programming effective January 1, 2016. Program amortization for these programs is now calculated on either an accelerated or straight-line basis based upon the greater amortization resulting from either the number of episodes aired or the portion of the license period consumed. 
  No other significant accounting policies and estimates have changed from those detailed in Note 1 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  . 
  Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  Dreamcatcher   Dreamcatcher Broadcasting LLC ( Dreamcatcher ) was formed in 2013 specifically to comply with the cross-ownership rules of the Federal Communications Commission (the  FCC ) related to the Company s acquisition of Local TV, LLC on December 27, 2013 (the  Local TV Acquisition ). See Note 5 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for additional information. The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   include the results of operations and the financial position of Dreamcatcher, a fully-consolidated variable interest entity ( VIE ). Net revenues of the Dreamcatcher stations (WTKR-TV, Norfolk, VA, WGNT-TV, Portsmouth, VA and WNEP-TV, Scranton, PA) included in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $17 million   and   $16 million  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , were   $52 million   and   $48 million  , respectively. Operating profits of the Dreamcatcher stations included in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $3 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , were   $10 million   and   $9 million  , respectively.

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include the following assets and liabilities of the Dreamcatcher stations (in thousands):    

(1)   December 31, 2015 balances have been reclassified to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of an associated debt liability in accordance with ASU 2015-03.  
  New Accounting Standard  s In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).  The standard addresses several specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash activities are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The cash flow issues addressed include debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investees and cash receipts and payments that may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326).  The standard requires entities to estimate loss of financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade receivables, debt securities and loans, using an expected credit loss model. The expected credit loss differs from the previous incurred losses model primarily in that the loss recognition threshold of  probably  has been eliminated and that expected loss should consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in addition to the previously considered past events and current conditions. Additionally, the guidance requires additional disclosures related to the further disaggregation of information related to the credit quality of financial assets by year of the asset s origination for as many as five years. Entities must apply the standard provision as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718).  The new guidance requires companies to record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, which will eliminate additional paid-in capital pools. Companies are to apply this amendment prospectively. The guidance also requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows, which can be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The guidance in ASU  

11 

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

2016-09 will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employees  shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. Additionally, the guidance requires companies to make a policy election to account for forfeitures of share-based payments by either recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur or estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting the estimate when it is likely to change. The election must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Subtopic 842).  The new guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases as well as extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures. A lessee will need to recognize on its balance sheet a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the majority of its leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The lease liabilities will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use asset will be measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayment, lease incentives received and the lessee s initial direct costs. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 is required to be applied using the modified retrospective approach for all leases existing as of the effective date and provides for certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10).  The new guidance requires entities to measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income and requires entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. Further, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale in other comprehensive income and they will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. The guidance has additional amendments to presentation and disclosure requirements of financial instruments. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In   May 2014  , the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The amendments in ASU 2014-09 create Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after   December 15, 2016  , including interim periods within that reporting period. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Deferral of the Effective Date,  which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, while allowing early adoption as of the original public entity date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which amends the revenue recognition guidance on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations as well as clarifies when a promised good or service is separately identifiable. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas such as an assessment of collectibility,

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition as well as adds some practical expedients. The amendments in ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 may be applied either retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 on its consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Company expects that the new revenue recognition standard will have an impact on revenue recognition under certain contracts in both the Television and Entertainment and Digital and Data segments. 
   
  NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS 
  2015 Acquisitions

The total purchase price for the Infostrada Sports, SportsDirect, Covers and Enswers acquisitions assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of these companies is as follows (in thousands): 

The allocation presented above is based upon management s estimate of the fair values using income, cost, and market approaches. In estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, the fair value estimates are based on, but not limited to, expected future revenue and cash flows, expected future growth rates and estimated discount rates. The definite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over a total weighted average period of   12   years that include weighted average periods of   11   years for customer relationships,   14   years for content databases,   8   years for technologies,   15   years for trade name and trademarks, and   5   years for non-competition agreements. The acquired property and equipment will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated remaining useful lives. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including assembled workforce, and noncontractual relationships, as well as expected future cost and revenue synergies.

The Company recorded a loss of   $37 million   on the extinguishment of the Former Term Loans in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a portion of the facility was considered extinguished for accounting purposes. The loss included the write-off of unamortized transaction costs of   $30 million  , an unamortized discount of   $4 million   and other transaction costs of   $4 million  . The Company s unamortized transaction costs related to the Term Loan Facility were   $27 million   and   $32 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These deferred costs are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of an associated debt liability in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the Term Loan Facility. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the election of the Company, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) Adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin in the range of   2.75%   to   3.0%   or (ii) the Alternative Base Rate plus an applicable margin in the range of   1.75%   to   2.0%  , based on the Company s net first lien senior secured leverage ratio for the applicable period. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a fee on letters of credit equal to the applicable margin for Adjusted LIBOR loans and a letter of credit issuer fronting fee equal to   0.125%   per annum, in each case, calculated based on the stated amount of letters of credit and payable quarterly in arrears, in addition to the customary charges of the issuing bank. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is also required to pay a commitment fee, payable quarterly in arrears, calculated based on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility; the commitment fee will be   0.25%  ,   0.375%   or   0.50%   based on the Company s net first lien senior secured leverage ratio for the applicable period. Overdue amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to additional interest of   2.0%   per annum.  
  Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and payable on   December 27, 2018  , but the Company may repay outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, subject to breakage costs in certain circumstances. The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility also must be prepaid and the letters of credit cash collateralized or terminated to the extent the extensions of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed the amount of the revolving commitments.

The Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant which requires the Company to maintain a net first lien leverage ratio of no greater than   5.25   to   1.00   for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended. The covenant is only required to be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter if the aggregate amount of revolving loans, swingline loans and letters of credit (other than undrawn letters of credit and letters of credit that have been fully cash collateralized) outstanding exceed   25%   of the amount of revolving commitments. This covenant was not required to be tested for the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility; however, there were   $23 million  , as of both periods, of standby letters of credit outstanding, primarily in support of the Company s workers  compensation insurance programs. 
  5.875% Senior Notes due 2022   On June 24, 2015, the Company issued   $1.100 billion   aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the  Notes ) under an Indenture, dated as of June 24, 2015 (the  Base Indenture ), among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (in such capacity, the  Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 24, 2015, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee (the  First Supplemental Indenture ), the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 8, 2015, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto and the Trustee (the  Second Supplemental Indenture ), and the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 8, 2015, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto and the Trustee (the  Third Supplemental Indenture  and, together with the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, the  Indenture ). The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to make the Prepayment discussed above. 
  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company incurred and deferred transaction costs of   $19 million  , which are classified as a debt discount in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes. During the first half of 2016, the Company incurred and deferred an additional   $1 million   of transaction costs related to filing an exchange offer registration statement (as discussed below) for the Notes. The Company s unamortized transaction costs related to the Notes were   $16 million   and   $17 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Notes bear interest at a rate of   5.875%   per annum and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2016. The Notes mature on July 15, 2022. The Notes are unsecured senior indebtedness of the Company and are effectively subordinated to the Company s and the Subsidiary Guarantors  existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Secured Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Indenture provides that the guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor is an unsecured senior obligation of that Subsidiary Guarantor. The Notes are, subject to certain exceptions, guaranteed by each of the Company s domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s obligations under the Secured Credit Facility.  
  The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to July 15, 2018, at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date, plus the applicable make-whole premium. The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time (i) on and after July 15, 2018 and prior to July 15, 2019, at a price equal to   102.938%   of the principal amount of the Notes, (ii) on or after July 15, 2019 and prior to July 15, 2020, at a price equal to   101.469%   of the principal amount of the Notes, and (iii) on or after July 15, 2020, at a price equal to   100.000%   of the principal amount of the Notes, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to July 15, 2018, the Company may redeem up to   40%   of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of   105.875%  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the date of redemption.

The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and the Company s restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock; repurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; make loans and investments; create restrictions on the ability of the Company s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event, the Company is required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes (unless otherwise redeemed) at a purchase price equal to   101%   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any to (but excluding) the repurchase date. If the Company sells assets under certain circumstances, it must use the proceeds to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to   100%   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the repurchase date. 
  Notes Registration Rights Agreement  
  In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into an exchange and registration rights agreement, dated as of June 24, 2015, with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the  Notes Registration Rights Agreement ). Pursuant to the Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors filed an exchange offer registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) to exchange the Notes and the Guarantees for substantially identical securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). The exchange offer registration statement on Form S-4 was declared effective on April 1, 2016, and on May 4, 2016, the Company completed the exchange of   $1.100 billion   of the Notes and the Guarantees for   $1.100 billion   of the Company s 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and the related guarantees, which have been registered under the Securities Act.  
  Dreamcatcher   The Company and the Guarantors guarantee the obligations of Dreamcatcher under its senior secured credit facility (the  Dreamcatcher Credit Facility ) entered into in connection with Dreamcatcher s acquisition of the Dreamcatcher stations (see Note 5 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  ). The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility are secured on a pari passu basis with its obligations under the Secured Credit Facility. 
   
  NOTE 8: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Company measures and records in its consolidated financial statements certain assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures,  establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). This hierarchy consists of the following three levels: 
             
    Level 1   Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.  
                
    Level 2   Assets and liabilities whose values are based on inputs other than those included in Level 1, including quoted market prices in markets that are not active; quoted prices of assets or liabilities with similar attributes in active markets; or valuation models whose inputs are observable or unobservable but corroborated by market data. 
                
    Level 3   Assets and liabilities whose values are based on valuation models or pricing techniques that utilize unobservable inputs that are significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
     The Company holds certain marketable equity securities which are traded on national stock exchanges. These securities are recorded at fair value and are categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value and cost basis of the Company s investment in tronc was   $6 million   and   $0  , respectively. As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value and  

26 

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

cost basis was   $4 million   and   $0  , respectively. The fair value and the cost basis of other marketable equity securities held by the Company as of   September 30, 2016   was not material. 
  Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).  
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short term to maturity. 
  Estimated fair values and carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in thousands): 

(1)   December 31, 2015 balances have been reclassified to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of an associated debt liability in accordance with ASU 2015-03. See Note 1 for further information. 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each category of financial instruments. 
  Cost Method Investments   Cost method investments in private companies are recorded at cost, net of write-downs resulting from periodic evaluations of the carrying value of the investments. No events or changes in circumstances occurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that suggested a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the Company s investments. The carrying value of the cost method investments at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   approximated fair value. The cost method investments would be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  
  Term Loan Facility   The fair value of the outstanding principal balance of the term loans under the Company s Term Loan Facility at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is based on pricing from observable market information in a non-active market and would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
  5.875% Senior Notes due 2022   The fair value of the outstanding principal balance of the Company s   5.875%   Senior Notes due 2022 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is based on pricing from observable market information in a non-active market and would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
  Dreamcatcher Credit Facility   The fair value of the outstanding principal balance of the Company s Dreamcatcher Credit Facility at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is based on pricing from observable market information for similar instruments in a non-active market and would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE 9: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  Chapter 11 Reorganization    On   December 8, 2008   (the  Petition Date ), Tribune Company and   110   of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the  Chapter 11 Petitions ) under chapter 11 ( Chapter 11 ) of title 11 of the United States Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Bankruptcy Court ). On   October 12, 2009  , Tribune CNLBC, LLC (formerly known as Chicago National League Ball Club, LLC) ( Tribune CNLBC ), which held the majority of the assets and liabilities related to the businesses of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball franchise (the  Chicago Cubs ), also filed a Chapter 11 Petition and thereafter became a Debtor. As further described in Note 3 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , a plan of reorganization for the Debtors became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on   December 31, 2012   (the  Effective Date ).   On March 16, 2015, July 24, 2015, May 11, 2016, and August 12, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered final decrees collectively closing     106   of the Debtors  Chapter 11 cases. The remaining Debtors  Chapter 11 proceedings continue to be jointly administered under the caption   In re Tribune Media Company, et al.  , Case No. 08-13141  . 
  From the Petition Date and until the Effective Date, the Debtors operated their businesses as  debtors-in-possession  under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court. See Note 3 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for additional information regarding the Debtors  Chapter 11 cases. 
  Where appropriate, the Company and its business operations as conducted on or prior to   December 30, 2012   are also herein referred to collectively as the  Predecessor.  The Company and its business operations as conducted on or subsequent to the Effective Date are also herein referred to collectively as the  Successor,   Reorganized Debtors  or  Reorganized Tribune Company.  
  On   April 12, 2012  , the Debtors, the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the Debtors  Chapter 11 cases, and creditors under certain of the Predecessor s prepetition debt facilities filed the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization for Tribune Company and its Subsidiaries with the Bankruptcy Court (as subsequently modified, the  Plan ). On   July 23, 2012  , the Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming the Plan (the  Confirmation Order ). The Plan constitutes a separate plan of reorganization for each of the Debtors and sets forth the terms and conditions of the Debtors  reorganization. See the  Terms of the Plan  section in Note 3 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for a description of the terms and conditions of the confirmed Plan. 
  Since the Effective Date, Reorganized Tribune Company has substantially consummated the various transactions contemplated under the Plan. In particular, the Company has made all distributions of cash, Common Stock and Warrants (each as defined and described in Note   12  ) that were required to be made under the terms of the Plan to creditors holding allowed claims as of   December 31, 2012  . Claims of general unsecured creditors that become allowed claims on or after the Effective Date have been or will be paid on the next quarterly distribution date after such allowance.  
  Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Company is also obligated to make certain additional payments to certain creditors, including certain distributions that may become due and owing subsequent to the Effective Date and certain payments to holders of administrative expense priority claims and fees earned by professional advisors during the Chapter 11 proceedings. On the Effective Date, Reorganized Tribune Company held restricted cash of   $187 million   which was estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , restricted cash held by the Company to satisfy the remaining claim obligations was   $18 million   and is estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such obligations. If the aggregate allowed amount of the remaining claims exceeds the restricted cash held for satisfying such claims, the Company would be required to satisfy the allowed claims from its cash on hand from operations.

Confirmation Order Appeals   Notices of appeal of the Confirmation Order were filed on   July 23, 2012   by (i) Aurelius Capital Management, LP ( Aurelius ), on behalf of its managed entities that were holders of the Predecessor s senior notes and Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures due 2029 ( PHONES ) and (ii) Law Debenture Trust Company of New York ( Law Debenture ), successor trustee under the indenture for the Predecessor s prepetition   6.61%   debentures due   2027   and the   7.25%   debentures due   2096  , and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ( Deutsche Bank ), successor trustee under the indentures for the Predecessor s prepetition medium-term notes due   2008  ,   4.875%   notes due   2010  ,   5.25%   notes due   2015  ,   7.25%   debentures due   2013   and   7.5%   debentures due   2023  . Additional notices of appeal were filed on   August 2, 2012   by Wilmington Trust Company ( WTC ), as successor indenture trustee for the PHONES, and on   August 3, 2012   by EGI-TRB, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by Sam Investment Trust (a trust established for the benefit of Samuel Zell and his family) (the  Zell Entity,  and, together with Aurelius, Law Debenture, Deutsche Bank and WTC, the  Appellants ). The confirmation appeals were transmitted to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the  Delaware District Court ) and were consolidated, together with two previously-filed appeals by WTC of the Bankruptcy Court s orders relating to certain provisions in the Plan, under the caption   Wilmington Trust Co. v. Tribune Co.   (  In re Tribune Co.  ), and under lead Case No. 12-cv-128 (GMS). 
  The Appellants sought, among other relief, to overturn the Confirmation Order and certain prior orders of the Bankruptcy Court embodied in the Plan, including the settlement of certain claims and causes of action related to the series of transactions (collectively, the  Leveraged ESOP Transactions ) consummated by the Predecessor, the Tribune Company employee stock ownership plan, the Zell Entity and Samuel Zell in 2007. See  Terms of the Plan  in Note 3 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for a description of the terms and conditions of the confirmed Plan and  Certain Causes of Action Arising From the Leveraged ESOP Transactions  in Note 3 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for a description of the Leveraged ESOP Transactions. WTC and the Zell Entity also sought to overturn determinations made by the Bankruptcy Court concerning the priority in right of payment of the PHONES and the subordinated promissory notes held by the Zell Entity and its permitted assignees, respectively. There is currently no stay of the Confirmation Order in place pending resolution of the confirmation-related appeals. In   January 2013  , the Company filed a motion to dismiss the appeals as equitably moot, based on the substantial consummation of the Plan. On   June 18, 2014  , the Delaware District Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. The effect of the order was to dismiss all of the appeals, with the exception of the relief requested by the Zell Entity concerning the priority in right of payment of the subordinated promissory notes held by the Zell Entity and its permitted assignees with respect to any state law fraudulent transfer claim recoveries from a creditor trust that was proposed to be formed under a prior version of the Plan, but was not formed under the Plan as confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. The Delaware District Court vacated the Bankruptcy Court s ruling to the extent it opined on that issue. On   July 16, 2014  , Aurelius, Law Debenture and Deutsche Bank timely appealed the Delaware District Court s order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On August 19, 2015, the Third Circuit affirmed the Delaware District Court s dismissal of Aurelius s appeal of the Confirmation Order. The Third Circuit, however, reversed the Delaware District Court s dismissal of Law Debenture s and Deutsche Bank s appeals of the Confirmation Order, and remanded those appeals to the District Court for further proceedings on the merits. On September 11, 2015, the Third Circuit denied Aurelius s petition for en banc review of the court s decision and on January 11, 2016, Aurelius filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. That petition was denied on March 31, 2016. If the remaining Appellants succeed on their appeal, our financial condition may be adversely affected.  
  Resolution of Outstanding Prepetition Claims   As of the Effective Date, approximately   7,400   proofs of claim had been filed against the Debtors. Additional claims were filed after the Effective Date, including to amend or supplement previously filed claims. Additional claims were also included in the Debtors  respective schedules of assets and liabilities which were filed with the Bankruptcy Court. Amounts and payment terms for these claims, if applicable, were established in the Plan. As of   October 31, 2016  , approximately   3,295   proofs of claim had been withdrawn or expunged as a result of the Debtors  evaluation of the filed proofs of claim and their efforts to reduce  

29 

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

and/or eliminate invalid, duplicative and/or over-stated claims. In addition, approximately   3,755   proofs of claim had been settled or otherwise satisfied pursuant to the terms of the Plan.  
  As of   October 31, 2016  , approximately   403   proofs of claim remain subject to further evaluation and adjustments. The majority of the remaining proofs of claim were filed by certain of the Company s former directors and officers, asserting indemnity and other related claims against the Company for claims brought against them in lawsuits arising from the Leveraged ESOP Transactions. Those lawsuits are pending in multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  NY District Court ) in proceedings captioned   In re Tribune Co. Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation  , under the consolidated docket numbers 1:11-md-02296 and 1:12-mc-02296. See  Certain Causes of Action Arising From the Leveraged ESOP Transactions  in Note 3 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for a description of the MDL proceedings in the NY District Court as of February 29, 2016. On March 24, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the  Second Circuit ) issued a decision upholding the NY District Court s dismissal of the state law constructive fraudulent transfer causes of action commenced by Deutsche Bank, Law Debenture and WTC, as indenture trustees for the Predecessor s senior noteholders and PHONES, and, separately, certain retirees (collectively and as subsequently amended, the  SLCFC Actions ), on the alternative grounds set forth in the cross-appeal of the defendants  liaison counsel on behalf of the defendants. The Second Circuit issued a corrected opinion upholding the dismissal of the SLCFC Actions on March 29, 2016. On September 9, 2016, the plaintiffs in the SLCFC Actions filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Second Circuit s decision. The remaining lawsuits pending in the MDL proceedings are asserted by the litigation trust formed, pursuant to the Plan, to pursue certain causes of action arising from the Leveraged ESOP Transactions for the benefit of certain creditors that received interests in the litigation trust as part of their distributions under the Plan (the  Litigation Trust ). Under the Plan, such indemnity-type claims against the Company must be set off against any recovery by the Litigation Trust against any of the directors and officers, and the Litigation Trust is authorized to object to the allowance of any such indemnity-type claims. 
  Adjustments to prepetition claims may result from, among other things, negotiations with creditors, further orders of the Bankruptcy Court and, in certain instances, litigation. The ultimate amounts to be paid in settlement of each of these claims, including indemnity claims, will continue to be subject to uncertainty for a period of time after the Effective Date. 
  Reorganization Items, Net   ASC Topic 852,  Reorganizations,  requires that the financial statements for periods subsequent to the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the operations of the business. Reorganization items, net included in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily include professional advisory fees and other costs related to the resolution of unresolved claims and totaled   $1 million   for each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . The Company expects to continue to incur certain expenses pertaining to the Chapter 11 proceedings throughout   2016   and in future periods.  
  FCC Regulation   Various aspects of the Company s operations are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the United States. The Company s television and radio broadcasting operations are subject to FCC jurisdiction under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. FCC rules, among other things, govern the term, renewal and transfer of radio and television broadcasting licenses, and limit the number of media interests in a local market that a single entity can own. Federal law also regulates the rates charged for political advertising and the quantity of advertising within children s programs. 
  Television and radio broadcast station licenses are granted for terms of up to   eight   years and are subject to renewal by the FCC in the ordinary course, at which time they may be subject to petitions to deny the license renewal applications. As of   November 9, 2016  , the Company had FCC authorization to operate   39   television stations and   one   AM radio station.  
  Under the FCC s  Local Television Multiple Ownership Rule  (the  Duopoly Rule ), the Company may own up to two television stations within the same Nielsen Designated Market Area ( DMA ) (i) provided certain specified signal contours of the stations do not overlap, (ii) where certain specified signal contours of the stations  

30 

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

overlap but, at the time the station combination was created, no more than one of the stations was a top-4-rated station and the market would continue to have at least eight independently-owned full power stations after the station combination is created or (iii) where certain waiver criteria are met. In a report and order issued in August 2016 (the  2014 Quadrennial Review Order ), the FCC, among other things, adopted a rule applying the  top-4  ownership limitation within a market to  affiliation swaps,  that will prohibit transactions between networks and their local station affiliates pursuant to which affiliations are reassigned in a way that results in common ownership or control of two of the top-four rated stations in the DMA. The prohibition is prospective only and does not apply to multiple top-4 network multicast streams broadcast by a single station. The new rule has not yet become effective. The Company owns duopolies permitted under the  top-4/8 voices  test in the Seattle, Denver, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Oklahoma City and New Orleans DMAs. The Indianapolis duopoly is permitted under the Duopoly Rule because it met the top-4/8 voices test at the time we acquired WTTV(TV)/WTTK(TV) in July 2002. Duopoly Rule waivers granted in connection with the FCC s approval of the Company s plan of reorganization (the  Exit Order ) or the Local TV Acquisition (the  Local TV Transfer Order ) authorize the Company s ownership of duopolies in the New Haven-Hartford and Fort Smith-Fayetteville DMAs, and full power  satellite  stations in the Denver and Indianapolis DMAs. 
  Under the FCC s  Newspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule  (the  NBCO Rule ), the Company and holders of  attributable interests  in the Company generally are prohibited from owning or holding attributable interests in both daily newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market. On August 4, 2014, the Company completed the Publishing Spin-off and retained   381,354   shares of tronc common stock, then representing   1.5%   of the outstanding common stock of tronc (see Note 2 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for further information). The Company determined that it does not have an attributable interest in the daily newspaper business or operations of tronc. As a result of the pro rata distribution of tronc stock to shareholders of the Company, the three attributable shareholders of the Company (collectively, the  Attributable Shareholders ) became attributable shareholders of tronc. The residual common attributable interests of the Attributable Shareholders in the Company and tronc maintain the status quo with respect to these shareholders  interests in the companies. 
  The Company s television/newspaper interests are subject to a temporary waiver of the NBCO Rule which was granted by the FCC in conjunction with its approval of the Plan (the  Exit Order ). On November 12, 2013, the Company filed with the FCC a request for extension of the temporary NBCO Rule waivers granted in the Exit Order. That request is pending. In the 2014 Quadrennial Order the FCC modified the NBCO Rule by providing an exception for failed or failing entities and allowing for consideration of waivers of the rule on a case-by-case basis. The new rules have not yet become effective. 
  The FCC s  National Television Multiple Ownership Rule  prohibits the Company from owning television stations that, in the aggregate, reach more than   39%   of total U.S. television households, subject to a   50%   discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the  UHF Discount ). The Company s current national reach exceeds the   39%   cap on an undiscounted basis. In August 2016, the FCC adopted rules eliminating the UHF Discount except for  grandfathered  existing combinations that exceeded the   39%   cap as of September 26, 2013. Under the new rule (effective November 23, 2016), absent a waiver, a grandfathered station group would have to come into compliance with the modified cap upon a sale or transfer of control. The elimination of the UHF Discount will affect the Company s ability to acquire additional television stations (including the Dreamcatcher stations that are the subject of certain option rights held by the Company, see Note 5 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for further information). 
  The Company provides certain operational support and other services to Dreamcatcher pursuant to shared services agreement ( SSA ). In the 2014 Quadrennial Order, the FCC adopted reporting requirements for SSAs. Meanwhile, in a public notice released on March 12, 2014, the FCC announced that pending and future transactions involving SSAs will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny if they include a combination of certain operational and economic features. Although the Company currently has no transactions pending before the FCC that would be subject to such higher scrutiny, this policy could limit the Company s future ability to enter into SSAs or similar arrangements.

In a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued on March 31, 2014, the FCC sought comment on whether to eliminate or modify its  network non-duplication  and  syndicated exclusivity  rules, pursuant to which local television stations may enforce their contractual exclusivity rights with respect to network and syndicated programming. That proceeding remains pending. Pursuant to the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 ( STELA ) Reauthorization Act, enacted in December 2014 ( STELAR ), the FCC has adopted regulations prohibiting a television station from coordinating retransmission consent negotiations or negotiating retransmission consent on a joint basis with a separately owned television station in the same market. The Company does not currently engage in retransmission consent negotiations jointly with any other stations in its markets. In response to Congress s directive in STELAR, on September 2, 2015, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ( NPRM ) seeking comment on whether the FCC should make changes to its rules requiring that commercial broadcast television stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( MVPDs ) negotiate in  good faith  for the retransmission by MVPDs of local television signals. On July 14, 2016, Chairman Wheeler announced that the FCC will not adopt additional rules governing parties  good faith negotiation obligations, (however, the FCC has not yet formally terminated the proceeding). 
  Federal legislation enacted in February 2012 authorizes the FCC to conduct voluntary  incentive auctions  in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to  repack  television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band and to require television stations that do not participate in the auction to modify their transmission facilities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs up to an industry-wide total of   $1.750 billion  . If any of the Company s television stations are required to change frequencies or otherwise modify their operations, the stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams. The FCC adopted rules to implement the incentive auction and repacking through a number of orders and public notices. Applications to participate in the auction, were due January 12, 2016. The Company has filed applications to participate in the auction and the auction is currently underway. The Company cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of the incentive auction, or any related FCC regulatory action. The FCC has adopted strict communications prohibitions with respect to the auction, which went into effect on January 12, 2016, and will remain in effect until the FCC publicly announces that the auction has ended (which could be as late as fourth quarter 2016 or later). During such time, the Company and its agents, employees, officers and directors are prohibited from directly or indirectly communicating (both internally and externally) certain information regarding the Company s auction participation. 
  As described in Note 5 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , the Company completed the Local TV Acquisition on   December 27, 2013   pursuant to FCC staff approval granted on   December 20, 2013   in the Local TV Transfer Order. On   January 22, 2014  , Free Press filed an Application for Review seeking review by the full Commission of the Local TV Transfer Order. The Company filed an Opposition to the Application for Review on   February 21, 2014  . Free Press filed a reply on   March 6, 2014  . The matter is pending.  
  On January 27, 2016, the FCC announced the initiation of a proceeding entitled  Proposal to Unlock the Set-Top Box: Creating Choice   Innovation.  On February 18, 2016, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making that proposed, among other things, to require program providers to pass through information about what programming is available, such as channel and program information and  entertainment identifier register IDs.  Adoption of this requirement without, among other things, adequately protecting proprietary and intellectual property rights in program guide content of which we are a major producer and distributor, and respecting contracts between entertainment data providers and their customers could negatively affect our entertainment data licensing business. This proceeding is currently pending and the Company cannot predict its outcome or timing. 
  From time to time, the FCC revises existing regulations and policies in ways that could affect the Company s broadcasting operations. In addition, Congress from time to time considers and adopts substantive amendments to the governing communications legislation. The Company cannot predict such actions or their resulting effect upon the Company s business and financial position.

  NOTE 10: INCOME TAXES 
  In the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded income tax expense of   $66 million   and   $289 million  , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the domestic production activities deduction, other non-deductible expenses, a   $9 million   benefit related to the resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters, a   $3 million   benefit to adjust the Company s deferred taxes, as described below, and a   $4 million   benefit resulting from a change in the Company s state tax rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to state income taxes (net of federal benefit), a   $102 million   charge to establish a reserve net of federal and state tax benefit for interest on the Newsday transaction, and a related   $88 million   charge to adjust the Company s deferred taxes, as described below, the domestic production activities deduction, other non-deductible expenses, a   $10 million   benefit related to the resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters and other adjustments, a   $5 million   charge related to the write-off of unrealized deferred tax assets related to stock-based compensation and a   $4 million   benefit resulting from a change in the Company s state tax rates. 
  In the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded income tax expense of   $11 million   and   $33 million  , respectively. The rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the domestic production activities deduction, and other non-deductible expenses. In addition, the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   had favorable adjustments totaling   $4 million   related to the resolution of certain federal income tax matters and other adjustments.  
  Newsday and Chicago Cubs Transactions   As further described in Note 9 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , the Company consummated the closing of the Newsday Transactions on   July 29, 2008  . As a result of these transactions, CSC, through NMG Holdings, Inc., owned approximately   97%   and the Company owned approximately   3%   of NHLLC. The fair market value of the contributed Newsday Media Group business ( NMG ) net assets exceeded their tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the IRC and related regulations. In   March 2013  , the IRS issued its audit report on the Company s federal income tax return for   2008   which concluded that the gain should have been included in the Company s   2008   taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS proposed a   $190 million   tax and a   $38 million   accuracy-related penalty. After-tax interest on the proposed tax and penalty through   September 30, 2016   would have been approximately   $48 million  . The Company disagreed with the IRS s position and timely filed a protest in response to the IRS s proposed tax adjustments. The Company would have also been subject to approximately   $22 million  , net of tax benefits, of state income taxes, interest and penalties through   September 30, 2016  .  
  During the second quarter of 2016, as a result of extensive discussions with the IRS administrative appeals division, the Company reevaluated its tax litigation position related to the Newsday transaction and re-measured the cumulative most probable outcome of such proceedings. As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a   $102 million   charge which was reflected as a   $125 million   current income tax reserve and a   $23 million   reduction in deferred income tax liabilities. The income tax reserve included federal and state taxes, interest and penalties while the deferred income tax benefit is primarily related to deductible interest expense. In connection with the potential resolution of the matter, the Company also recorded   $91 million   of income tax expense to increase the Company s deferred income tax liability to reflect the estimated reduction in the tax basis of the  

33 

TRIBUNE MEDIA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Company s assets. The reduction in tax basis is required to reflect the expected negotiated reduction in the amount of the Company s guarantee of the Newsday partnership debt which was included in the reported tax basis previously determined upon emergence from bankruptcy. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS administrative appeals division regarding the Newsday transaction which applies for tax years 2008 through 2015. Under the terms of the agreement reached with the IRS appeals office, which were materially consistent with the Company s reserve at June 30, 2016, the Company paid   $115 million   for federal tax, interest and penalties in the third quarter of 2016. The tax payment was recorded as a reduction in the Company s current income tax reserve described above. The Company expects to make payments of an additional   $10 million   by the end of the first quarter of 2017 for state tax, interest and penalties. In connection with the agreement, the Company also recorded an income tax benefit of   $3 million   to adjust the previously recorded estimate of the deferred tax liability adjustment described above. 
  Through December 31, 2015, the Company also made approximately   $136 million   of federal and state tax payments through its regular tax reporting process which included   $101 million   that became payable upon closing of the sale of the Newsday partnership interest as further described in Note   6  .  
  As further described in Note 9 to the Company s   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , the Company consummated the closing of the Chicago Cubs Transactions on   October 27, 2009  . As a result of these transactions, Ricketts Acquisition LLC owns   95%   and the Company owns   5%   of the membership interests in New Cubs LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the IRC and related regulations. On June 28, 2016, the IRS issued the Company a Notice of Deficiency ( Notice ) which presents the IRS s position that the gain should have been included in the Company s 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS has proposed a   $182 million   tax and a   $73 million   gross valuation misstatement penalty. After-tax interest on the proposed tax and penalty through   September 30, 2016   would be approximately   $38 million  . The Company continues to disagree with the IRS s position that the transaction generated a taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS s calculation of the gain. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS s determination. If the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions is deemed to be taxable in   2009  , the Company estimates that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately   $225 million   before interest and penalties. However, if the IRS prevails in their position, any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by any tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009. Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company has paid approximately   $39 million   through its regular tax reporting process. The Company does not maintain any tax reserves relating to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016   includes a deferred tax liability of   $160 million   related to the future recognition of taxable income related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions.  
  Other   Although management believes its estimates and judgments are reasonable, the resolutions of the Company s tax issues are unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by the Company. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, which addresses the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $23 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $34 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately   $8 million   within the next twelve months due to the resolution of tax examination issues and statute of limitations expirations.

Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares in open-market purchases in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased   2,364,173   shares for   $88 million   at an average price of   $37.35   per share and   4,179,085   shares for   $158 million   at an average price of   $37.70   per share, respectively, inclusive of   229,407   shares, valued at   $8 million  , for which the Company placed trades on or prior to September 30, 2016 that were not settled until the fourth quarter of 2016.

  Special Cash Dividend   On   March 5, 2015  , the Board authorized and declared a special cash dividend of   $6.73   per share of Common Stock (the  Special Cash Dividend ), which was paid on   April 9, 2015   to holders of record of Common Stock at the close of business on   March 25, 2015  .

The DEUs will be reinvested in RSUs and PSUs and settled concurrently with the vesting of associated RSUs and PSUs. Pursuant to the Company s policy, the forfeitable DEUs and dividends payable in cash are treated as a reduction of retained earnings or, if the Company is in a retained deficit position, as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

  On   March 1, 2013  , the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Equity Incentive Plan ) for the purpose of granting stock awards to directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Stock awarded pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan was limited to   five   percent of the outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis as of the Effective Date. There were   5,263,000   shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan. Prior to the adoption of the 2016 Equity Plans, the Company had   616,332   shares of Class A Common Stock available for grant under the Equity Incentive Plan. Subsequent to the approval of the 2016 Equity Plans by the Company s shareholders, no additional awards will be granted under the Equity Incentive Plan. 
  The Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options ( NSOs ), incentive stock options ( ISOs ), stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance share units ( PSUs ), restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards (collectively  Equity Awards ). The Directors Plan provides for the granting of shares, stock options and other stock-based awards (collectively  Director Equity Awards ). Pursuant to ASC Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation,  the Company measures stock-based compensation costs on the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The Company s equity plans allow employees and directors to surrender to the Company shares of vested common stock upon vesting of their stock awards or at the time they exercise their NSOs in lieu of their payment of the required withholdings for employee taxes. The Company does not withhold taxes on Equity Awards in excess of minimum required statutory requirements. 
  Holders of RSUs and PSUs also receive DEUs until the RSUs or PSUs vest. See Note   12   for further information. The number of DEUs granted for each RSU or PSU is calculated based on the value of the dividends per share paid on the Company s Common Stock and the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on the dividend payment date. The DEUs vest with the underlying RSU or PSU. 
  NSO and RSU awards generally vest   25%   on each anniversary of the date of the grant. Under the 2016 Equity Plans, the exercise price of an NSO award cannot be less than the market price of the Class A Common Stock at the time the NSO award is granted and has a maximum contractual term of   10 years  .  
  PSU awards generally cliff vest at the end of the   three  -year performance periods, depending on the period specified in each respective PSU agreement. The number of PSUs that ultimately vest depends on the Company s performance relative to specified financial targets for fiscal years   2016  ,   2017   and   2018  . In the second quarter of 2016, the Company granted   214,416   supplemental PSU awards ( Supplemental PSUs ) to certain executive officers. A portion of the Supplemental PSUs will be eligible to vest until March 1, 2018 if a closing stock price of the Company s Class A Common Stock is maintained for   10   consecutive trading days that equals or exceeds   $44   and each increment of   $2   thereafter, up to a maximum of   $64  , as adjusted for dividends declared (each such increment, a  Stock Price Hurdle ). No Stock Price Hurdle will be counted twice, and none of the Supplemental PSUs will vest unless the minimum   $44   Stock Price Hurdle is achieved by March 1, 2018.  
  Unrestricted stock awards have been issued to certain members of the Board as compensation for retainer fees and long-term awards. The Company intends to facilitate settlement of all vested awards in common stock, with the exception of certain RSUs granted to non-US based employees which the Company expects to settle in cash.  
  The Company estimates the fair value of NSO awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including the expected term of the awards, volatility of the stock price, risk-free rates of return and dividend yield. The Company determines the fair value of PSU, RSU and unrestricted and restricted stock awards by reference to the quoted market price of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. The Company determined the fair value of Supplemental PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

NOTE 14: EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  The Company computes earnings (loss) per common share ( EPS ) under the two-class method which requires the allocation of all distributed and undistributed earnings to common stock and other participating securities based on their respective rights to receive distributions of earnings or losses. The Company s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock equally share in distributed and undistributed earnings. The Company accounts for the Warrants as participating securities, as holders of the Warrants, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Warrant Agreement, are entitled to receive ratable distributions of the Company s earnings concurrently with such distributions made to the holders of Common Stock, subject to certain restrictions relating to FCC rules and requirements. Under the terms of the Company s RSU and PSU agreements, unvested RSUs and PSUs contain forfeitable rights to dividends and DEUs. Because the DEUs are forfeitable, they are defined as non-participating securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   39,628   DEUs outstanding, which will vest at the time that the underlying RSU or PSU vests. 
  The Company computes basic EPS by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. In accordance with the two-class method, undistributed earnings applicable to the Warrants are excluded from the computation of basic EPS. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period as adjusted for the assumed exercise of all outstanding stock awards. The calculation of diluted EPS assumes that stock awards outstanding were exercised at the beginning of the period. The stock awards are included in the calculation of diluted EPS only when their inclusion in the calculation is dilutive.

ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share,  states that the presentation of basic and diluted EPS is required only for common stock and not for participating securities. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   159,243   and   194,943  , respectively, of the weighted-average Warrants outstanding, have been excluded from the below table. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   308,612   and   1,069,798  , respectively, of the weighted-average Warrants outstanding, have been excluded from the below table.  
  The calculation of basic and diluted EPS is presented below (in thousands, except for per share data):   

  Since the Company was in a net loss position for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was no difference between the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted loss per share in the period. Because of their anti-dilutive effect,   1,714,643   and   2,148,796   common share equivalents, comprised of NSOs, PSUs, Supplemental PSUs and RSUs, have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Because of their anti-dilutive effect,   2,189,552   and   1,489,698   common share equivalents, comprised of NSOs, PSUs and RSUs, have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.

  OVERVIEW 
  We are a diversified media and entertainment company comprised of 42 television stations, which we refer to as  our television stations,  that are either owned by us or owned by others, but to which we provide certain services, along with a national general entertainment cable network, a radio station, a production studio, a digital and data technology business, a portfolio of real estate assets and investments in a variety of media, websites and other related assets. We believe our diverse portfolio of assets distinguishes us from traditional pure-play broadcasters through our high-quality original and syndicated programming, our ability to capitalize on revenue growth from our Digital and Data assets, cash distributions from our equity investments and revenues from our real estate assets. 
  Our business operates in the following two reportable segments: 
             
    Television and Entertainment:   Provides audiences across the country with news, entertainment and sports programming on Tribune Broadcasting local television stations and distinctive, high quality television series and movies on WGN America, including content produced by Tribune Studios and its production partners, as well as news, entertainment and sports information via our websites and other digital assets. Our Television and Entertainment reportable segment consists of 42 television stations and related websites, including 39 owned stations and 3 stations to which we provide certain services (the  SSAs ) with Dreamcatcher Broadcasting LLC ( Dreamcatcher  WGN America, a national general entertainment cable network; Tribune Studios, a production company that sources and produces original and exclusive content for WGN America and our local television stations; Antenna TV and THIS TV, national multicast networks; www.screenertv.com (formerly www.Zap2it.com); and WGN, a radio station in Chicago.  

56 

Digital and Data:   Provides innovative technology and services that collect and distribute video, music, sports and entertainment data primarily through wholesale distribution channels to consumers globally. Our Digital and Data reportable segment consists of several businesses driven by our expertise in collection, creation and distribution of data and innovation in unique services and recognition technology that use data, including Gracenote Video, Gracenote Music and Gracenote Sports.  
     We also hold a variety of investments in cable and digital assets, including equity investments in Television Food Network, G.P. ( TV Food Network ) and CareerBuilder, LLC ( CareerBuilder ). In addition, we report and include under   Corporate and Other   the management of certain real estate assets, including revenues from leasing our owned office and production facilities and any gains or losses from the sales of our owned real estate, as well as certain administrative activities associated with operating corporate office functions and managing our predominantly frozen company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans.  
  Our results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the historical seasonality of our advertising revenues. Typically, second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues. Results for the second quarter usually reflect spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter includes advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuations from political advertising as political spending is usually significantly higher in even numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections. For additional information on the businesses we operate, see  Item 1. Business  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ) and our other filings with the SEC. 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 
  Exploration of Strategic and Financial Alternatives 
  On February 29, 2016, we announced that the Board of Directors (the  Board ) and the Company have retained financial advisors and initiated a process to explore a full range of strategic and financial alternatives to enhance shareholder value. The strategic and financial alternatives under consideration include, but are not limited to, the sale or separation of select lines of business or assets, strategic partnerships, programming alliances and return of capital initiatives. We continue to work with our financial advisors on a strategic review of our assets. In this regard, we are pleased with the closing of several real estate transactions and with the announcement by TEGNA Inc. ( TEGNA ) of its decision to evaluate strategic alternatives for CareerBuilder. In addition, we are considering a variety of other actions, including but not limited to returns of capital to shareholders and debt repayment, but have nothing definitive to report at this time. 
   
  Monetization of Real Estate Assets 
  As previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report, we have accelerated the monetization of a significant portion of our real estate portfolio. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold several properties for net pretax proceeds totaling $473 million and $505 million, respectively, and recognized a net pretax gain of $213 million in the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as further described below. We define net proceeds as pretax cash proceeds on the sale of properties, net of associated selling costs.    
  On May 2, 2016, we sold our Deerfield Beach, FL property for net proceeds of $24 million, and on June 2, 2016, we sold our Allentown, PA property for net proceeds of $8 million. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a net pretax loss of less than $1 million on the sale of these properties that is included in selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ).  
  On July 7, 2016, we sold our Seattle, WA property for net proceeds of $19 million and entered into a lease retaining the use of more than a minor portion of the property. We recorded a deferred pretax gain of $8 million on this sale which will be amortized over the life of the lease due to the transaction being a sale-leaseback. On July 12, 2016, we sold two of our Orlando, FL properties for net proceeds of $34 million and recorded a net pretax gain of $2 million on the sale of these properties. On July 14, 2016, we sold our Arlington Heights, IL property for net proceeds  

57 

of $0.4 million. On September 26, 2016, we sold the Tribune Tower in Chicago, IL ( Tribune Tower ) and the north block of the Los Angeles Times Square property in downtown Los Angeles, CA ( LA Times Property ) for net proceeds of $200 million and $102 million, respectively, and recognized a pretax gain of $93 million and $59 million, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreements, we could receive contingent payments of up to an additional $35 million related to the Tribune Tower transaction and an additional $10 million related to the LA Times Property transaction. For both the Tribune Tower and LA Times Property sales, the contingent payments become payable if certain conditions are met pertaining to development rights related to the respective buyer s plans for development of portions of the two properties. The contingency period for both properties ends five years from the sale date with the possibility of extension in certain circumstances. On September 27, 2016, we sold the Olympic Printing Plant facility in the Arts District of downtown Los Angeles, CA for net proceeds of $119 million and recognized a pretax gain of $59 million.    
  As of November 9, 2016, we have agreements for the sales of certain broadcasting real estate properties located in Chicago, IL, Denver, CO and Portsmouth, VA, some of which will qualify as sale-leasebacks. All of these transactions are expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2016. The closing of these transactions is subject to certain adjustments and customary closing conditions and there can be no assurance that these sales will be completed in a timely manner or at all. We expect to broaden this sales activity to other properties depending on market conditions.    
   
  DISH Network Programming Agreement 
  On June 12, 2016, Tribune Broadcasting s programming agreement with DISH Network expired and as a result our local television stations and WGN America were temporarily off DISH Network. On September 3, 2016, we announced that a long-term, comprehensive agreement with DISH Network on carriage and retransmission consent fees had been signed, covering our local television stations and WGN America.  
   
  Chapter 11 Reorganization 
  On December 8, 2008 (the  Petition Date ), Tribune Company and 110 of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the  Chapter 11 Petitions ) under chapter 11 ( Chapter 11 ) of title 11 of the United States Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Bankruptcy Court ). As further described and defined in Note 3 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , a plan of reorganization (the  Plan ) for the Debtors became effective and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 on   December 31, 2012   (the  Effective Date ).   On March 16, 2015, July 24, 2015, May 11, 2016, and August 12, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered final decrees collectively closing     106   of the Debtors  Chapter 11 cases. The remaining Debtors  Chapter 11 proceedings continue to be jointly administered under the caption   In re: Tribune Media Company, et al.  , Case No. 08-13141. 
  From the Petition Date and until the Effective Date, the Debtors operated their businesses as  debtors-in-possession  under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court. 
  On the Effective Date, all of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived, the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11, and the settlements, agreements and transactions contemplated by the Plan to be effected on the Effective Date were implemented, including, among other things, the appointment of a new board of directors and the initiation of distributions to creditors. As a result, our ownership changed from the employee stock ownership plan ( ESOP ) to certain of our creditors on the Effective Date (as defined and described in Note 3 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  ). On January 17, 2013, our Board appointed a chairman of the board and a new chief executive officer. Such appointments were effective immediately. 
  Since the Effective Date, we have substantially consummated the various transactions contemplated under the Plan. In particular, we have made all distributions of cash, common stock and warrants that were required to be  

58 

made under the terms of the Plan to creditors holding allowed claims as of December 31, 2012. Claims of general unsecured creditors that become allowed claims on or after the Effective Date have been or will be paid on the next quarterly distribution date after such allowance. At   September 30, 2016  , restricted cash held by us to satisfy the remaining claim obligations was   $18 million   and is estimated to be sufficient to satisfy such obligations. If the aggregate allowed amount of the remaining claims exceeds the restricted cash held for satisfying such claims, we will be required to satisfy the allowed claims from our cash on hand from operations. See Note   9   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and Note 3 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for further information regarding the Chapter 11 proceedings. 
   
  Secured Credit Facility 
  On   December 27, 2013  , in connection with our acquisition of Local TV, we as borrower, along with certain of our operating subsidiaries as guarantors, entered into a   $4.073 billion   secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPMorgan ) (the  Secured Credit Facility ). The Secured Credit Facility consists of a   $3.773 billion   term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) and a   $300 million   revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ). The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used to pay the purchase price for Local TV and refinance the existing indebtedness of Local TV and the Term Loan Exit Facility. On June 24, 2015, we, the Guarantors (as defined below) and JPMorgan, as administrative agent, entered into an amendment (the  Amendment ) to the Secured Credit Facility. Prior to the Amendment and the Prepayment (as defined below), $3.479 billion of term loans (the  Former Term Loans ) were outstanding under the Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Amendment, certain lenders under the Secured Credit Facility converted their Former Term Loans into the new tranche of term loans (the  Converted Term B Loans ), along with term loans advanced by certain new lenders, of $1.802 billion (the  New Term B Loans  and, together with the Converted Term B Loans, the  Term B Loans ). The proceeds of Term B Loans advanced by the new lenders were used to prepay in full all of the Former Term Loans that were not converted into Term B Loans. In addition, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes (as defined below), together with cash on hand, to prepay (the  Prepayment ) $1.100 billion of Term B Loans. After giving effect to the Amendment and all prepayments contemplated thereby (including the Prepayment), there were $2.379 billion of Term B Loans outstanding under the Secured Credit Facility. All amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility are due and payable on December 27, 2020. We may repay the term loans at any time without premium penalty, subject to certain breakage costs. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and payable on   December 27, 2018  , but we may repay outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, subject to breakage costs in certain circumstances. We recorded a loss of   $37 million   on the extinguishment of the Former Term Loans in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a portion of the facility was considered extinguished for accounting purposes. 
  Our obligations under the Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ). The Secured Credit Facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the personal property and assets of our Company and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The Secured Credit Facility contains customary limitations, including, among other things, on the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and liens, sell assets, make investments and pay dividends to our shareholders. 
  The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are available for working capital and other purposes not prohibited under the Secured Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as  swingline loans.  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of defaults and accuracy of representations and warranties. Under the terms of the Secured Credit Facility, the amount of the Term Loan Facility and/or the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased and/or one or more additional term or revolving facilities may be added to the Secured Credit Facility by entering into one or more incremental facilities, subject to a cap equal to the greater of (x)   $1.000 billion   and (y) the maximum amount that would not cause our net first lien senior secured  

59 

leverage ratio (treating debt incurred in reliance of this basket as secured on a first lien basis whether or not so secured), as determined pursuant to the terms of the Secured Credit Facility, to exceed   4.50  :  1.00  , subject to certain conditions. See Note   7   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   for further information and significant terms and conditions associated with the Secured Credit Facility, including but not limited to interest rates, repayment terms, fees, restrictions, and affirmative and negative covenants. 
   
  5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 
  On June 24, 2015, we issued $1.100 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the  Notes ) under an Indenture, dated as of June 24, 2015 (the  Base Indenture ), among us, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (in such capacity, the  Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 24, 2015, among us, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee (the  First Supplemental Indenture ), the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 8, 2015, among us, the Subsidiary Guarantors parties thereto and the Trustee (the  Second Supplemental Indenture ), and the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 8, 2015, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto and the Trustee (the  Third Supplemental Indenture  and, together with the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, the  Indenture ). We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to prepay $1.100 billion of Term B Loans under the Secured Credit Facility. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per annum and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2016. The Notes mature on July 15, 2022. The Notes are unsecured senior indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to our and the Subsidiary Guarantors  existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Secured Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Indenture provides that the guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor is an unsecured senior obligation of that Subsidiary Guarantor. The Notes are, subject to certain exceptions, guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Secured Credit Facility. 
  In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into an exchange and registration rights agreement, dated as of June 24, 2015, with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the  Notes Registration Rights Agreement ). Pursuant to the Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors filed an exchange offer registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to exchange the Notes and the Guarantees for substantially identical securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). The exchange offer registration statement on Form S-4 was declared effective on April 1, 2016, and on May 4, 2016, we completed the exchange of   $1.100 billion   of the Notes and the Guarantees for   $1.100 billion   of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and the related guarantees, which have been registered under the Securities Act.  
  See Note   7   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   for further information and significant terms and conditions associated with the Notes, including but not limited to repayment terms, fees, restrictions, and affirmative and negative covenants. 
   
  Newsday and Chicago Cubs Transactions 
  As further described in Note 9 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , we consummated the closing of the Newsday Transactions on July 29, 2008. As a result of these transactions, CSC Holdings, LLC ( CSC ), formerly CSC Holdings, Inc., through NMG Holdings, Inc., owned approximately 97% and we owned approximately 3% of Newsday Holdings LLC ( NHLLC ). The fair market value of the contributed Newsday Media Group business  net assets exceeded their tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) and related regulations. In March 2013, the IRS issued its audit report on our federal income tax return for 2008 which concluded that the gain should have been included in our 2008 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS proposed a   $190 million   tax and a   $38 million   accuracy-related penalty. After-tax interest on the proposed tax and penalty through   September 30, 2016   would have been approximately   $48 million  . We disagreed with the IRS s position and timely filed a protest in response to the IRS s proposed tax adjustments. We  

60 

would have also been subject to approximately   $22 million  , net of tax benefits, of state income taxes, interest and penalties through   September 30, 2016  .  
  During the second quarter of 2016, as a result of extensive discussions with the IRS administrative appeals division, we reevaluated our tax litigation position related to the Newsday transaction and re-measured the cumulative most probable outcome of such proceedings. As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $102 million charge which was reflected as a $125 million current income tax reserve and a $23 million reduction in deferred income tax liabilities. The income tax reserve included federal and state taxes, interest and penalties while the deferred income tax benefit is primarily related to deductible interest expense. In connection with the potential resolution of the matter, we also recorded $91 million of income tax expense to increase our deferred income tax liability to reflect the estimated reduction in the tax basis of the our assets. The reduction in tax basis is required to reflect the expected negotiated reduction in the amount of the Company s guarantee of the Newsday partnership debt which was included in the reported tax basis previously determined upon emergence from bankruptcy. During the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with the IRS administrative appeals division regarding the Newsday transaction which applies for tax years 2008 through 2015. Under the terms of the agreement reached with the IRS appeals office, which were materially consistent with our reserve at June 30, 2016, we paid $115 million for federal tax, interest and penalties in the third quarter of 2016. The tax payment was recorded as a reduction in our current income tax reserve described above. We expect to make payments of an additional $10 million by the end of the first quarter of 2017 for state tax, interest and penalties. In connection with the agreement, we also recorded an income tax benefit of $3 million to adjust the previously recorded estimate of the deferred tax liability adjustment described above. Through December 31, 2015, we also made approximately $136 million of federal and state tax payments through our regular tax reporting process which included $101 million that became payable upon closing of the sale of the Newsday partnership interest as further described in Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    
  As further described in Note 9 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , we consummated the closing of the Chicago Cubs Transactions on October 27, 2009. As a result of these transactions, Ricketts Acquisition LLC owns 95% and we own 5% of the membership interests in New Cubs, LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the IRC and related regulations.   On June 28, 2016, the IRS issued to us a Notice of Deficiency ( Notice ) which presents the IRS s position that the gain should have been included in our 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS has proposed a $182 million tax and a $73 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. After-tax interest on the proposed tax and penalty through September 30, 2016 would be approximately $38 million. We continue to disagree with the IRS s position that the transaction generated a taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS s calculation of the gain. During the third quarter of 2016, we filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS s determination. We continue to pursue resolution of this disputed tax matter with the IRS. If the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions is deemed to be taxable in 2009, we estimate that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately $225 million before interest and penalties. However, if the IRS prevails in their position, any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by any tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009.   Through   September 30, 2016  , we have paid approximately   $39 million   of federal and state tax payments through our regular tax reporting process. We do not maintain any tax reserves relating to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   include a deferred tax liability of   $160 million   related to the future recognition of taxable income related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. 
   
  TV Food Network 
  On October 24, 2016, Tribune (FN) Cable Ventures, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an extension of the partnership agreement governing TV Food Network, which extended the term of the partnership until December 31, 2020.

CareerBuilder 
  On September 7, 2016, TEGNA announced that it is evaluating strategic alternatives for CareerBuilder, including a possible sale. There are no guarantees that any of the options under review will result in a transaction. 
   
  2015 Acquisitions 
   
  In May 2015, we completed the acquisitions of all issued and outstanding equity interests in Infostrada Sports, SportsDirect and Covers. In conjunction with these acquisitions, we launched Gracenote Sports, which is a part of the Digital and Data segment s product offerings. Infostrada Sports and SportsDirect provide us with in-depth sports data, including schedules, scores, play-by-play statistics, as well as team and player information for the major professional leagues around the world including the National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, European Football League, and the Olympics. Covers is the operator of Covers.com, a North American online sports gaming destination for scores, odds and matchups, unique editorial analysis, and industry news coverage. In May 2015, we also completed an acquisition of all issued and outstanding equity interests in Enswers, a leading provider of automatic content recognition technology and systems based in South Korea, which expanded our Digital and Data segment s product offerings. The total acquisition price for Infostrada Sports, SportsDirect, Covers and Enswers totaled   $70 million  , net of cash acquired. See Note   2   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   for additional details on these acquisitions. 
   
  Employee Reductions 
  We recorded pretax charges, mainly consisting of employee severance costs and associated termination benefits, totaling $8 million in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, we recorded pretax charges for severance and related expenses totaling $3 million and $4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. These charges are included in direct operating expenses or SG A, as appropriate, in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The accrued liability for severance and related expenses is reflected in employee compensation and benefits in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and was   $9 million   and   $4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  On April 16, 2015, the Board approved the change of our fiscal year end from the last Sunday in December of each year to December 31 of each year and to change our fiscal quarter end to the last calendar day of each quarter. This change in fiscal year end was effective with the second fiscal quarter of 2015, which ended on June 30, 2015. As a result of this change, the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   have two fewer days compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  The following discussion and analysis presents a review of our operations as of and for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  

62 

CONSOLIDATED 
  Consolidated operating results for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   are shown in the table below: 

* 
    Represents positive or negative change equal to, or in excess of 100% 
     Operating Revenues and Operating Profit (Loss)   Consolidated operating revenues and operating profit (loss) by business segment for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

* 
    Represents positive or negative change equal to, or in excess of 100% 
     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Consolidated operating revenues   increased     6%  , or   $29 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to an increase of   $29 million   in Television and Entertainment revenues, driven by higher advertising revenue, retransmission consent fees and carriage fees and an increase of   $3 million   in Digital and Data revenues, partially offset by a   $2 million   decline in Corporate and Other primarily due to the loss of revenue as a result of the sales of certain real estate properties during 2016. Consolidated operating profit   increased     $184 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to   $213 million   of gains recorded on the sales of real estate, partially offset by lower Television and Entertainment operating profit, primarily due to a $37 million program impairment charge for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America and higher severance expense, a higher operating loss in Digital and Data driven by increased costs and a higher operating loss in Corporate and Other (excluding real estate gains). 

63 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Consolidated operating revenues   increased     7%  , or   $102 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to an increase of   $95 million   in Television and Entertainment revenues, driven by higher advertising revenue, retransmission consent fees, and carriage fees, partially offset by lower copyright royalties and an increase of   $9 million   in Digital and Data revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Infostrada Sports, SportsDirect, Covers and Enswers, which were acquired in May 2015 (the  2015 Acquisitions ) and higher video revenues, partially offset by a decline in music revenue. Consolidated operating profit   increased     $176 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to   $213 million   of gains recorded on the sales of real estate, partially offset by slightly lower Television and Entertainment operating profit as higher revenues were mostly offset by the $37 million program impairment charge, higher severance expense and other cost increases, a higher operating loss in Digital and Data driven by increased costs and a higher Corporate and Other operating loss (excluding real estate gains) primarily due to $12 million of impairment charges associated with certain real estate properties. 
  Operating Expenses   Consolidated operating expenses for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

* 
    Represents positive or negative change equal to, or in excess of 100% 
     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Programming expense, which represented   29%   of revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   24%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   increased     29%  , or   $33 million  , primarily due to a $37 million impairment charge for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America and an increase in network affiliate fees, partially offset by a reduction in outside production expenses and lower amortization of license fees. 
  Direct operating expenses, which represented   23%   of revenues for both the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  ,   increased     7%  , or   $8 million  . Compensation expense   increased     7%  , or   $6 million  , primarily due to higher direct pay and benefits and increased Digital and Data staffing as the business enters new markets. All other direct operating expenses, such as outside services, occupancy expense and royalty expense,   increased     10%  , or   $2 million  . 
  SG A expenses, which represented   33%   of revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   31%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   increased     12%  , or   $18 million  , due mainly to higher compensation and outside services expenses. Compensation expense   increased     16%  , or   $12 million  , due to a $5 million increase in severance, a $2 million increase in incentive compensation primarily at Corporate and Other, a $2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense across all segments and a $1 million decrease in the amount of labor capitalized for software and content development at Digital and Data. Outside services   increased     32%  , or   $7 million  , primarily related to costs for operating the websites of our television stations associated with  

64 

higher digital revenues, higher professional and legal fees and license fees related to technology application implementations.  
  Gain on sales of real estate, net of   $213 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to the sales of Tribune Tower, the LA Times Property and the Olympic Printing Plant facility. 
  Depreciation expense   fell     2%  , or less than $1 million, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The decrease in depreciation expense is primarily due to property sales and the real estate properties classified as assets held for sale which are no longer depreciable. 
  Amortization expense   decreased     1%  , or less than $1 million, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Programming expenses, which represented   25%   of revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   24%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   increased     14%  , or   $49 million  , primarily due to a $37 million impairment charge for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America and higher amortization of license fees and network affiliate fees, partially offset by lower outside production costs.  
  Direct operating expenses, which represented   22%   of revenues for both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  ,   increased     7%  , or   $22 million  . Compensation expense   increased     4%  , or   $11 million  , due to a $5 million increase at Television and Entertainment driven by merit increases and a $6 million increase at Digital and Data primarily due to the 2015 Acquisitions and higher direct pay and benefits due to an increase in staffing levels. All other direct operating expenses, such as outside services, occupancy expense and royalty expense increased by   18%  , or   $11 million  , primarily due to the absence of a $6 million payment received in the first quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of a music license fee class action lawsuit, a $3 million increase in royalty expense at Digital and Data and a $3 million increase in costs for data processing related to the development of Automatic Content Recognition ( ACR ) services at Digital and Data. 
  SG A expenses, which represented   34%   of revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   32%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   increased     14%  , or   $66 million  , due mainly to higher compensation, promotion expenses, outside services and other expenses. Compensation expense   increased     11%  , or   $25 million  , due to a $5 million increase in severance related to employee reductions, a $5 million increase at Television and Entertainment driven by merit increases, an $8 million increase at Digital and Data primarily due to higher direct pay and benefits due to an increase in staffing levels and the 2015 Acquisitions, as well as a $4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense across all segments.

TELEVISION AND ENTERTAINMENT  
  Operating Revenues and Operating Profit   The table below presents Television and Entertainment operating revenues, operating expenses and operating profit for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .    

  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Television and Entertainment operating revenues   increased     7%  , or   $29 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   largely due to increases in advertising revenue, retransmission consent fees and carriage fees. 
  Television and Entertainment operating profit   decreased     28%  , or   $18 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   mainly due to higher programming expenses resulting from a $37 million program impairment charge for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America and higher compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in operating revenue of   $29 million  , as further described below. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Television and Entertainment operating revenues   increased     7%  , or   $95 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   largely due to increases in advertising revenue, retransmission consent fees and carriage fees.  
  Television and Entertainment operating profit   decreased     $2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as an increase in operating revenues of   $95 million   was more than offset by higher programming expenses of   $49 million   resulting from a $37 million program impairment charge for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America along with higher original programming content and network fees and higher compensation of   $17 million   and other expenses of   $33 million  , as further described below.  
  Operating Revenues   Television and Entertainment operating revenues, by classification, for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

66 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Advertising Revenues   Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions,   increased     3%  , or   $10 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to a $26 million increase in net political advertising revenue and a $2 million increase in digital advertising revenue. The increase was partially offset by lower net core advertising revenues (comprised of local and national advertising, excluding political and digital) of $18 million primarily due to the 2016 Summer Olympics which negatively impacted advertising revenues for stations other than NBC affiliates. Net political advertising revenues, which are a component of total advertising revenues, were $31 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $6 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   due to 2016 being an election year.  
  Retransmission Consent Fees   Retransmission consent fees   increased     13%  , or   $9 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to an $18 million increase from higher rates included in retransmission consent renewals of our MVPD agreements, partially offset by a decline in revenue due to a decrease in the number of subscribers resulting from a move to alternative platforms for media consumption. Additionally, there was a decline in revenue due to the blackout of our stations by DISH Network from June 12, 2016 to September 3, 2016. 
  Carriage Fees   Carriage fees   increased     48%  , or   $9 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   mainly due to a $6 million increase from higher rates for the distribution of WGN America and additional revenue of $3 million resulting from an increase in the number of subscribers due to expanded distribution. 
  Barter/Trade Revenues   Barter/trade revenues   declined     2%  , or less than $1 million, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Copyright Royalties   Copyright royalties   decreased     14%  , or less than $1 million, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as the full conversion of WGN America from a superstation to a cable network occurred in 2015. As a cable network, WGN America no longer generates copyright royalties revenue. 
  Other Revenues   Other     revenues are primarily derived from profit sharing and revenue on syndicated content. Other revenues   increased     28%  , or   $2 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   mainly due to profit sharing from   Outsiders   and   Manhattan  .

The increase was partially offset by lower net core advertising revenues (comprised of local and national advertising, excluding political and digital) of $20 million primarily due to the 2016 Summer Olympics which negatively impacted advertising revenues for stations other than NBC affiliates. Net political advertising revenues, which are a component of total advertising revenues, were $60 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $12 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to 2016 being an election year. 
  Retransmission Consent Fees   Retransmission consent fees   increased     18%  , or   $37 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to a $54 million increase from higher rates included in retransmission consent renewals of our MVPD agreements, partially offset by a decline in revenue due to a decrease in the number of subscribers resulting from a move to alternative platforms for media consumption. Additionally, there was a decline in revenue due to the blackout of our stations by DISH Network, as noted above. 
  Carriage Fees   Carriage fees   were up     44%  , or   $28 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due mainly to a $19 million increase from higher rates for the distribution of WGN America and additional revenue of $9 million resulting from an increase in the number of subscribers. 

67 

Barter/Trade Revenues   Barter/trade revenues   increased     1%  , or less than $1 million, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Copyright Royalties   Copyright royalties   decreased     55%  , or   $6 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The decrease was attributable to the full conversion in 2015 of WGN America from a superstation to a cable network. As a cable network, WGN America no longer generates copyright royalties revenue. 
  Other Revenues   Other     revenues are primarily derived from profit sharing and revenue on syndicated content. Other revenues   increased     19%  , or   $4 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to additional profit sharing from   Outsiders   and   Manhattan.

  Television and Entertainment operating expenses   were up     13%  , or   $47 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period largely due to a $37 million program impairment charge and higher compensation expenses, as further described below.

The increase was primarily due to a $5 million increase in direct pay and benefits mainly due to higher staffing levels at various television stations and merit increases, along with a $6 million increase in severance expense. Severance expense was $7 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $1 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Programming Expense   Programming expense   increased     29%  , or   $33 million  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to a $37 million impairment charge for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America and an increase in network affiliate fees, partially offset by a reduction in outside production expenses and lower amortization of license fees. The reduction in outside production expenses primarily related to the first seasons of the original programs   Underground   and   Outsiders,   which premiered in 2016 but were produced in 2015 with no comparable productions in 2016. Amortization of license fees decreased primarily due to the cancellation of   Manhattan  , partially offset by the syndicated program   Person of Interest  .

Other expenses increased   7%  , or   $4 million  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   resulting from a $4 million increase in outside services, primarily related to costs for operating the websites of our television stations. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Television and Entertainment operating expenses   were up     9%  , or   $97 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period largely due to a $37 million program impairment charge and higher programming, compensation and other expenses, as further described below.  
  Compensation Expense   Compensation expense, which is included in both direct operating expenses and SG A expense,   increased     4%  , or   $17 million  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to higher direct pay and benefits of $9 million, a $5 million increase in severance expense and an increase of $3 million for incentive compensation and stock-based compensation expenses. Severance expense was $7 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $2 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

The increase in network affiliate fees was mainly related to renewals of certain network affiliation agreements in the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, as well as other contractual increases. The increase in amortization of license fees was primarily due to first-run original programs   Outsiders   and   Underground   and syndicated programs   Person of Interest   and   Elementary  , partially offset by the delay in airing   Salem   season 3 to fall of 2016 and the cancellation of   Manhattan  . The reduction in outside production expenses was related to the first seasons of the original programs   Underground   and   Outsiders  , which premiered in 2016 but were produced in 2015 with no comparable productions in 2016.

  Although management believes its estimates and judgments are reasonable, the resolutions of our income tax issues are unpredictable and could result in income tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by us. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Cash flows generated from operating activities is our primary source of liquidity. We expect to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program (see   Repurchases of Equity Securities  below), interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, income tax payments, potential payments related to our uncertain tax positions, dividend payments on our common stock (see   Cash Dividends  below) and related distributions to holders of Warrants and other operating requirements in the next twelve months through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on our balance sheet, distributions from or sales of our investments, sales of real estate assets, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, and any refinancings thereof, additional debt financing, if any, and disposals of assets or operations, if any. We have recently decided to accelerate the monetization of our real estate portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   8   real estate properties held for sale, as further described in Note   4   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We expect to broaden this sales activity to other properties to take advantage of robust market conditions although there can be no assurance that any such divestitures can be completed in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. 
  For our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to these sources, we may rely upon the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of non-core assets. 
  Our financial and operating performance remains subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and, despite our current liquidity position, no assurances can be made that cash flows from operations and investments, future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and any refinancings thereof, or dispositions of assets or operations will be sufficient to satisfy our future liquidity needs.

Sources and Uses 
  The table below details the total operating, investing and financing activity cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

Operating activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $187 million   compared to net cash provided of   $8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to lower cash paid for income taxes and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher cash payments for broadcast rights. Cash paid for income taxes, net of income tax refunds, decreased by   $172 million   to   $159 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $331 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to the payment of taxes in 2015 on the gain from the sale of our equity interest in CV in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by the payment of taxes in the third quarter of 2016 related to the Newsday settlement. Distributions from equity investments decreased by   $13 million   to   $144 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $156 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Investing activities 
  Net cash provided by investing activities totaled   $442 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Our capital expenditures in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $62 million  . In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received net proceeds of   $507 million   related to the sale of real estate and other assets, as further described in Note   4   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Net cash used in investing activities totaled   $114 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Our acquisitions totaled $75 million, net of cash acquired, and included the 2015 Acquisitions. Our capital expenditures in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   totaled   $64 million  . In the nine months of 2015, we received net proceeds of approximately $22 million from the sales of our investments and real estate of which $8 million related to the sale of our investment in Newsday Holdings LLC, $8 million related to a cash distribution pursuant to CV s collection of a contingent receivable and $5 million related to the sale of two real estate properties which were held for sale as of December 28, 2014. 
  Financing activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $248 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling   $69 million  . Cash paid for the Class A Common Stock repurchases, which were made pursuant to our $400 million stock repurchase program authorized on February 26, 2016, totaled   $149 million   (see   Repurchases of Equity Securities  below for further information). We also repaid   $21 million   of borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. 

76 

Net cash used in financing activities was   $1.0 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In conjunction with the Amendment of our Secured Credit Facility on June 24, 2015, we issued   $1.1 billion   aggregate principal amount of the Notes and used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to prepay   $1.100 billion   of Term B Loans under the Secured Credit Facility, as further described below. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we paid dividends of   $696 million  , including the quarterly cash dividends of $48 million and the special cash dividend of $649 million. During the first nine months of 2015, cash paid for the Class A Common Stock repurchases pursuant to our $400 million stock repurchase program authorized on October 13, 2014 totaled $273 million (see   Repurchases of Equity Securities  below for further information). 
   
  Debt   
  Our debt consisted of the following (in thousands): 

(1)   December 31, 2015 balances have been reclassified to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of an associated debt liability in accordance with ASU 2015-03. See Note 1 for further information.    
  Secured Credit Facility   On   December 27, 2013  , in connection with our acquisition of Local TV, we as borrower, along with certain of our operating subsidiaries as guarantors, entered into a   $4.073 billion   Secured Credit Facility. The Secured Credit Facility consisted of the   $3.773 billion   Term Loan Facility and a   $300 million   Revolving Credit Facility. On June 24, 2015, we, the Guarantors and JPMorgan, as administrative agent, entered into the Amendment to the Secured Credit Facility. Prior to the Amendment and the Prepayment, $3.479 billion of Former Term Loans were outstanding under the Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Amendment, certain lenders under the Secured Credit Facility converted their Former Term Loans into the Converted Term B Loans in an aggregate amount, along with term loans advanced by certain new lenders, of $1.802 billion. The proceeds of Term B Loans advanced by the new lenders were used to prepay in full all of the Former Term Loans that were not converted into Term B Loans. In addition, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to make the Prepayment of $1.100 billion of Term B Loans. After giving effect to the Amendment and all prepayments contemplated thereby (including the Prepayment), there were $2.379 billion of Term B Loans outstanding under the Secured Credit Facility. We recorded a loss of   $37 million   on the extinguishment of the Former Term Loans in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations in the second quarter of 2015 as a portion of the facility was considered extinguished for accounting purposes. The Term B Loans mature on December 27, 2020. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and payable on   December 27, 2018  . See Note   7   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   for further information and significant terms and conditions associated with the Secured Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, interest rates, repayment terms, fees, restrictions, and affirmative and negative covenants. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are available for working capital and other purposes not prohibited under the Secured Credit Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility; however, there were   $23 million   of standby letters of credit outstanding primarily in support of our workers compensation insurance programs.  

77 

5.875% Senior Notes due 2022   On June 24, 2015, we issued $1.100 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to prepay $1.100 billion of Term B Loans under the Secured Credit Facility. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per annum and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2016. The Notes mature on July 15, 2022. 
  Dreamcatcher Credit Facility   We and the Guarantors guarantee the obligations of Dreamcatcher under its Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. See Note 9 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for the description of the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility. Our obligations and the obligators of the Guarantors under the Dreamcatcher Credit Facility are secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under the Secured Credit Facility. 
   
  Repurchases of Equity Securities 
  On October 13, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $400 million of our outstanding Class A Common Stock in open-market purchases in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 1,101,160 shares in open market transactions for $68 million at an average price of $61.58 per share which includes 125,566 shares, valued at $8 million, for which we placed trades prior to December 28, 2014 that were not settled until the first three days of the first fiscal quarter of 2015. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 6,569,056 shares of Class A Common Stock in open market transactions for $332 million at an average price of $50.59 per share, of which 4,724,463 shares were repurchased in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, at an average price of $56.14 per share. As of December 31, 2015, we repurchased the full $400 million, totaling 7,670,216 shares, authorized under the repurchase program. 
  On February 24, 2016, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $400 million of our outstanding Class A Common Stock. Under the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase shares in open-market purchases in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The extent to which we repurchase our shares and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by our management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to finance the purchases with available cash, cash flows from operations or debt facilities. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   4,179,085   shares of Class A Common Stock in open market transactions for   $158 million   at an average price of   $37.70   per share, inclusive of   229,407   shares, valued at   $8 million  , for which the Company placed trades on or prior to   September 30, 2016   that were not settled until the fourth quarter of 2016. See  Part II. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Repurchases of Equity Securities  for the table summarizing monthly repurchases of our Class A Common Stock during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining authorized amount under the current authorization totaled approximately   $242 million  . 
   
  Cash Dividends 
  The Board declared quarterly cash dividends on Common Stock to holders of record of Common Stock and Warrants as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

78 

On November 3, 2016, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on Common Stock of $0.25 per share to be paid on December 6, 2016 to holders of record of Common Stock and Warrants as of November 21, 2016. 
  On April 9, 2015, we paid a special cash dividend of $6.73 per share to holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on March 25, 2015. The total aggregate payment on April 9, 2015 totaled   $649 million  , including the payment to holders of Warrants.  
  Any determination to pay dividends on our common stock, and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates and payment dates, is subject to the discretion of our Board and will depend upon various factors then existing, including our earnings and cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions (including the restricted payment covenant contained in the credit agreement governing the Secured Credit Facility and the Indenture governing the Notes, as further described in Note   7   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ), restrictions imposed by applicable law, general business conditions and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, concurrently with any cash dividend made to holders of our common stock, holders of Warrants are entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of the dividend paid per share of common stock for each Warrant held. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  There have been no material changes from the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements discussion previously disclosed in our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   contained in our 2015 Annual Report. 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  There were no changes to critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in  Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  of our   2015   Annual Report. 
  New Accounting Standards   See Note   1   to our   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   for a discussion of new accounting guidance. 
  Broadcast Rights   We amortize broadcast rights costs over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the timing of the usage and benefit from such programming. Newer licensed/acquired programming and original produced programming are generally amortized on an accelerated basis as the episodes are aired. For certain categories of licensed programming and feature films that have been exploited through previous cycles, amortization expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. We also have commitments for network and sports programming that are expensed on a straight-line basis as the programs are available to air. Management s judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, and includes analyses of historical and estimated future revenue and ratings patterns for similar programming. We regularly review, and revise when necessary, our revenue estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization. Amortization of broadcast rights are expensed to programming in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  We carry the broadcast rights at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate the net realizable value of broadcast rights on a daypart, series, or title-by-title basis, as appropriate. Changes in management s intended usage of a specific daypart, series, or program would result in a reassessment of the net realizable value, which could result in an impairment. We determine the net realizable value and estimated fair value, as appropriate, based on a projection of the estimated advertising revenues and carriage/retransmission revenues, less certain direct costs of delivery, expected to be generated by the program material, all of which are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. If our estimates of future revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or impairment adjustments may be required. We assess future seasons of syndicated programs that we are committed to acquire for impairment as they become available to us for airing. Any impairments of  

79 

programming rights are expensed to programming in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  As a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with broadcast rights, we recognized an impairment charge of $37 million for the syndicated program   Elementary   at WGN America in the third quarter of 2016. We have commitments to acquire additional seasons produced of   Elementary   in future periods. Additional impairments may be required when these seasons become available to air if estimates of future revenues for these programs have not improved. 
  As a result of an updated analysis completed in the first quarter of 2016, we updated our amortization model for certain categories of programming effective January 1, 2016. Program amortization for these programs is now calculated on either an accelerated or straight-line basis based upon the greater amortization resulting from either the number of episodes aired or the portion of the license period consumed. 
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   We review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount (a  Triggering Event ), in accordance with ASC Topic 350. The estimated fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated are determined using many critical factors, including projected future operating cash flows, revenue and market growth, market multiples, discount rates and consideration of market valuations of comparable companies. The estimated fair value of other intangible assets subject to the annual impairment review, which include FCC licenses and trade name, are generally calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analyses. The development of estimated fair values requires the use of assumptions, including assumptions regarding revenue and market growth as well as specific economic factors in the broadcasting and media entertainment industries. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside our control. 
  We did not identify any Triggering Events during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Adverse changes in expected operating results and/or unfavorable changes in other economic factors used to estimate fair values could result in additional non-cash impairment charges. 
   
  ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  There have been no material changes from the quantitative and qualitative discussion about market risk previously disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms such that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A,  Controls and Procedures  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, management identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting  .   Because of this material weakness, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2015. 

80 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the date of their evaluation, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   September 30, 2016   due to the previously identified material weakness, which continued to exist as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Notwithstanding such material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that our consolidated financial statements in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )  . 
  Remediation Plan 
  Our management has made progress in remediating the previously identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The remediation efforts that are continuing to be executed include the following: 
             
    Enhancing processes and procedures across all information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
                
    Improving existing program change management control activities and policies, including processes to maintain sufficient documentation evidencing the execution of these policies.  
                
    Implementing additional tools to better capture and monitor changes to relevant financial systems. 
                
    Improving the design and operation of control activities and procedures associated with user and administrator access to the affected IT systems, including both preventive and detective control activities.  
                
    Educating and re-training control owners regarding risks, controls and maintaining adequate evidence.  
                
    Clarifying and communicating appropriate roles and responsibilities for controls and systems for both IT and business users. 
                
    Increasing resources dedicated to monitoring IT general controls to ensure compliance with policies, procedures, and processes.  
     Management believes the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. Because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful remediation of the material weakness will require review and evidence of effectiveness prior to management concluding that the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The previously identified material weakness will not be considered fully addressed until the enhanced internal controls over the design and operating effectiveness of IT general controls for information systems have been in operation for a sufficient period of time for our management to conclude that the material weakness has been fully remediated. Management will continue to test and evaluate the implementation of these new processes and internal controls to ascertain whether they are designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that they will prevent or detect a material error in our financial statements. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the remediation plan described above. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

81 

PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The legal entities comprising our operations are defendants from time to time in actions for matters arising out of their business operations. In addition, the legal entities comprising our operations are involved from time to time as parties in various regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies.  
  On December 31, 2012, the Debtors that had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court on December 8, 2008 (or on October 12, 2009, in the case of Tribune CNLBC, LLC) emerged from Chapter 11. The Company and certain of the other legal entities included in our consolidated financial statements were Debtors or, as a result of the restructuring transactions undertaken at the time of the Debtors  emergence, are successor legal entities to legal entities that were Debtors.   On March 16, 2015, July 24, 2015, May 11, 2016, and August 12, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered final decrees collectively closing     106   of the Debtors  Chapter 11 cases. The remaining Debtors  Chapter 11 cases have not yet been closed by the Bankruptcy Court, and certain claims asserted against the Debtors in the Chapter 11 cases remain unresolved. As a result, we expect to continue to incur certain expenses pertaining to the Chapter 11 proceedings in future periods, which may be material. See Note 3 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015   for further information.  
  In March 2013, the IRS issued its audit report on our federal income tax return for 2008 which concluded that the gain from the Newsday Transactions should have been included in our 2008 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS proposed a $190 million tax and a $38 million accuracy-related penalty. After-tax interest on the proposed tax through   September 30, 2016   would have been approximately   $48 million  . We disagreed with the IRS s position and timely filed a protest in response to the IRS s proposed tax adjustments. We also would have been subject to approximately   $22 million  , net of tax benefits, of state income taxes, interest and penalties through   September 30, 2016  .  
  During the second quarter of 2016, as a result of extensive discussions with the IRS administrative appeals division, we reevaluated our tax litigation position related to the Newsday transaction and re-measured the cumulative most probable outcome of such proceedings. As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $102 million charge which was reflected as a $125 million current income tax reserve and a $23 million reduction in deferred income tax liabilities. The income tax reserve included federal and state taxes, interest and penalties while the deferred income tax benefit is primarily related to deductible interest expense. In connection with the potential resolution of the matter, we also recorded $91 million of income tax expense to increase our deferred income tax liability to reflect the estimated reduction in the tax basis of the our assets. The reduction in tax basis is required to reflect the expected negotiated reduction in the amount of the Company s guarantee of the Newsday partnership debt which was included in the reported tax basis previously determined upon emergence from bankruptcy. During the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with the IRS administrative appeals division regarding the Newsday transaction which applies for tax years 2008 through 2015. Under the terms of the agreement reached with the IRS appeals office, which were materially consistent with our reserve at June 30, 2016, we paid $115 million for federal tax, interest and penalties in the third quarter of 2016. The tax payment was recorded as a reduction in our current income tax reserve described above. We expect to make payments of an additional $10 million by the end of the first quarter of 2017 for state tax, interest and penalties. In connection with the agreement, we also recorded an income tax benefit of $3 million to adjust the previously recorded estimate of the deferred tax liability adjustment described above. Through December 31, 2015, we also made approximately $136 million of federal and state tax payments through our regular tax reporting process which included $101 million that became payable upon closing of the sale of the Newsday partnership interest as further described in Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

82 

As further described in Note 9 to our   audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , we consummated the closing of the Chicago Cubs Transactions on October 27, 2009. As a result of these transactions, Ricketts Acquisition LLC owns 95% and we own 5% of the membership interests in New Cubs, LLC. The fair market value of the contributed assets exceeded the tax basis and did not result in an immediate taxable gain because the transaction was structured to comply with the partnership provisions of the IRC and related regulations.   On June 28, 2016, the IRS issued to us a Notice of Deficiency ( Notice ) which presents the IRS s position that the gain should have been included in our 2009 taxable income. Accordingly, the IRS has proposed a $182 million tax and a $73 million gross valuation misstatement penalty. After-tax interest on the proposed tax and penalty through September 30, 2016 would be approximately $38 million. We continue to disagree with the IRS s position that the transaction generated a taxable gain in 2009, the proposed penalty and the IRS s calculation of the gain. During the third quarter of 2016, we filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court to contest the IRS s determination. We continue to pursue resolution of this disputed tax matter with the IRS. If the gain on the Chicago Cubs Transactions is deemed to be taxable in 2009, we estimate that the federal and state income taxes would be approximately $225 million before interest and penalties. However, if the IRS prevails in their position, any tax, interest and penalty due will be offset by any tax payments made relating to this transaction subsequent to 2009.   Through   September 30, 2016  , we have paid approximately   $39 million   through our regular tax reporting process. 
  We do not maintain any tax reserves related to the Chicago Cubs Transactions. In accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016   includes deferred tax liabilities of   $160 million   related to the future recognition of taxable income and gain from the Chicago Cubs Transactions. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $23 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $34 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  We do not believe that any other matters or proceedings presently pending will have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, legal matters and proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters and proceedings will not materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
   
  ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS 
  We discuss in our filings with the SEC various risks that may materially affect our business. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report. The materialization of any risks and uncertainties identified in forward-looking statements contained in this report together with those previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See  Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking Statements.  
   
  ITEM 2.   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities  
  On December 31, 2012, we emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and pursuant to the Plan, issued 78,754,269 shares of Class A Common Stock, 4,455,767 shares of Class B Common Stock, and 16,789,972 Warrants, which are governed by the Warrant Agreement. The Warrants are exercisable at the holder s option into Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, or a combination thereof, at an exercise price of $0.001 per share or through  cashless exercise,  whereby the number of shares to be issued to the holder is reduced, in lieu of a cash payment for the exercise price.  
  Since the initial issuance of the Warrants on December 31, 2012 through   September 30, 2016  , we have issued   16,487,199   shares of Class A Common Stock and   143,477   shares of our Class B Common Stock upon the exercise of   16,630,729   Warrants. Of these exercises, we issued   12,589,212   shares of Class A Common Stock and   25,244   shares of Class B Common Stock, respectively, for cash, receiving total proceeds of   $12,615   from the exercises.  

83 

In addition, we issued   3,897,987   shares of Class A Common Stock and   118,233   shares of Class B Common Stock, respectively, upon  cashless exercises.  
  The issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and Warrants at the time of emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrants, were exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code, which generally exempts distributions of securities in connection with plans of reorganization. 
  None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions.  
  Repurchases of Equity Securities  
  The following table summarizes repurchases of our Class A Common Stock in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   pursuant to the $400 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board on February 24, 2016: 

(1)   Excludes 69,719 shares of Class A Common Stock for which the Company placed trade orders valued at $3 million prior to June 30, 2016 but which were not settled until the third quarter of 2016.

  (ii)  Except as expressly provided for herein (i.e. breach of a representation), from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall look solely to the title company issuing such title insurance policy for any loss, damage or claim attributable to any matter pertaining to the status of title to the Premises.  The provisions of this   Section 5(a)(ii)   shall survive the Closing and the recording of the Deed.  Purchaser may also order an update to the Existing Survey (the Existing Survey, as so updated, being referred to herein as the    Survey   ).  Costs of the Title Commitment and Survey shall be paid as provided in   Section 12     below. 
    
  (iii)  Purchaser has approved the title as shown in the Title Commitment, the title exceptions listed therein, and all matters shown on the Survey and any such exceptions or matters are hereby deemed to be    Permitted Exceptions   , other than those matters set forth on   Exhibit L   (the    Unpermitted Exceptions   ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all mortgages, other monetary liens, real estate taxes due and payable prior to Closing and any liens for services and/or materials, other than TI Liens addressed as provided in the definition of Permitted Exceptions (collectively,    Monetary Exceptions   ), shall automatically be deemed to be Unpermitted Exceptions, and Seller shall have an affirmative obligation to cure all such Monetary Exceptions at or prior to Closing.  
    
  (b)  Notice of Objection  . 
    
  (i)  All title exceptions or other matters identified in the Title Commitment or Survey which are not set forth on     Exhibit L   (other than Monetary Exceptions) shall be considered Permitted Exceptions.

  (iv)  For the purposes of this Agreement, the removal or satisfaction of any Unpermitted Exception or the procurement by Seller of a commitment for the issuance of the Title Policy (as defined in   Section 8(a)(iii)   hereof) or an endorsement thereto insuring Purchaser against any such Unpermitted Exception, reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, shall be deemed a    cure        by Seller of such Unpermitted Exception. 
    
  (c)  Title Termination Notice  . 
    
  (i)  If Seller does not deliver a Response Notice prior to the expiration of the Seller Notice Period, or if Seller s Response Notice states that Seller will not cure a matter set forth in Purchaser s Notice of Objection, Purchaser may, as its sole and exclusive remedy at law or in equity, terminate this Agreement by sending notice in writing to Seller (the    Title Termination Notice   ) within ten (10) days after Purchaser s receipt of the Response Notice (or, in the event that a Response Notice is not timely delivered, within ten (10) days after the expiration of the Seller Notice Period).

  (i)  All representations and warranties by Seller set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects at and as of the Closing Date as if such representations and warranties were made at and as of the Closing Date; provided, however that in no event shall any of the following be deemed  material  hereunder:  (i) information which was disclosed to purchaser or otherwise actually known to Purchaser prior to the Effective Date, (ii) changes permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (  e.g  . pursuant to   Section 9  ), or (iii) information which discloses loss or damage to the Premises as a result of fire or other casualty or condemnation (which shall be governed by the terms of   Section 13   below).

  (iv)  Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a tenant estoppel certificate in the form of   Exhibit K   (or such other form as is provided in the applicable tenant s lease, it being agreed moreover that the form of estoppel from Tribune Publishing Company and/or its affiliates may be in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit K-1  ) from each of the tenants in the Premises.

Major Tenant    shall mean each tenant of the Improvements as of the Effective Date whose lease demises more than 50,000 square feet in the Improvements.  Purchaser agrees that the Required Threshold shall be met even though executed tenant estoppel certificates may not be in the form sent to the tenant pursuant to this   Section 8(a)   if the modifications to such estoppel certificates, in the aggregate, are not material and do not disclose any defaults, the exercise of any rights of set off or any other exceptions inconsistent in any material respect with the representations and warranties made by Seller hereunder. Without limitation of the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller agree that the following types of modifications to a tenant estoppel certificate shall not be deemed material: the omission of any information that the tenant is not required to furnish pursuant to the terms of its Lease.  Purchaser shall have the right to object to any estoppel certificate which discloses any fact which contradicts representations and warranties made by Seller herein, and any such fact shall be deemed a material modification for purposes of this   Section 8(a)(iv)  . 
    
  (b)  In the event all of the foregoing conditions precedent to Purchaser s obligations set forth in   Section 8(a)   are not satisfied by the Closing Date, then Purchaser, shall be deemed to have waived any unsatisfied condition precedent, with no deduction from or adjustment of the Purchase Price unless Purchaser delivers written notice to Seller on or before the Closing Date that Purchaser elects to not proceed to Closing, in which event, the Termination Consequences shall apply.

Purchaser shall be responsible for the remainder of the 2016 real estate taxes and real estate taxes for all subsequent years.

Seller and Purchaser agree that all Rent received after the Closing Date shall be applied first to costs of collection, next to rent payable during the month in which the Closing occurs, then current Rent and finally to delinquent Rent, if any, in the inverse order of maturity.  Purchaser will make a good faith commercially reasonable effort after Closing to collect all Rents in the usual course of the operation of the Property, but Purchaser will not be obligated to institute any lawsuit or other collection procedures to collect delinquent Rents.  Seller shall have no right to enforce Leases or collect delinquent Rents on or after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which may be withheld in Purchaser s sole discretion, and any such permitted enforcement or collection effort shall be at Seller s sole expense.

The Reimbursable Tenant Expenses for calendar year 2016 shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser based on the amounts so collected by them and the amounts so paid or incurred by them during their respective periods of ownership (including amounts prorated hereunder).  If any such reconciliation statements show that the amounts collected by Seller prior to the Closing Date exceed Seller s allocable share of such Reimbursable Tenant Expenses, then Seller shall promptly pay such amounts to Purchaser for prompt payment to the Tenants.  If such reconciliation statements show that Seller is owed any such Reimbursable Tenant Expenses from a tenant under a Lease, then Purchaser shall promptly pay such amounts to Seller promptly after receipt thereof by Purchaser from the applicable tenant, provided that all Reimbursable Tenant Expenses received after the Closing Date shall be applied first to costs of collection, next to those payable during the month in which the Closing occurs, then current charges and finally to delinquent charges, if any, in the inverse order of maturity.

Once all revenue and expense amounts have been ascertained, Purchaser shall prepare, and certify as correct, a final proration statement which shall be subject to Seller s approval.  Upon Seller s acceptance and approval of any final proration statement submitted by Purchaser, such statement shall be conclusively deemed to be accurate and final. 
    
  (n)  Any amounts due Seller or Purchaser under this   Section 11   from the other party, which are not paid within fifteen (15) days following written demand, shall bear interest from and after the date of demand at the annual rate of interest equal to the Prime Rate (as hereinafter defined) plus 5%.

  (ii) any loss due to a condemnation prior to Closing which permanently and materially impairs the current use of the Premises, involves the loss of a material portion of the Premises, or materially impairs access to the Premises, or (iii) any loss or damage which would allow any Major Tenant, or tenants whose Leases cover in the aggregate more than 50,000 square feet, to terminate their Leases (unless the applicable Major Tenant or tenants waive said right).

Purchaser expressly waives its rights to seek money damages in the event of Seller s default hereunder including, without limitation, punitive, consequential or speculative damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this   Section 15(b)  , if Purchaser has the right to seek specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to such foregoing provisions, but such specific performance is not available as a remedy due to Seller s sale of the Assets to a third party while this Agreement remained in full force and effect or due to Seller s intentional breach of this Agreement, and provided that Purchaser is not in material default hereunder, Purchaser shall have the right to sue Seller for monetary damages, excluding punitive, consequential or speculative damages.

Without the prior written consent of Seller, there shall be no recordation of either this Agreement or any memorandum hereof, or any affidavit pertaining hereto, and any such recordation of this Agreement or memorandum or affidavit by Purchaser without the prior written consent of Seller shall constitute a default hereunder by Purchaser, whereupon Seller shall have the remedies set forth herein. 
    
  (s)  Agreement to Indemnify  .  Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that an obligation of Seller will be assumed by Purchaser after the Closing, Purchaser shall be deemed to have also agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its respective successors and assigns from and against all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  and accountants  fees and expenses) arising from any failure of Purchaser to perform the obligation so assumed after the Closing.
