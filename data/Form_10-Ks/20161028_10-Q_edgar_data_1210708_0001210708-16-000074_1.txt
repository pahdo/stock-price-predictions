NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States of America ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Hudson Global, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") filed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of operating revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on management s knowledge and judgments. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented have been included. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intra-entity balances and transactions between and among the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE 3   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15,   "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU 2016-15"),   which provides clarification on how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   "Stock Compensation (Topic 718)" ("ASU 2016-09")  , which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02")  , which amends the existing standards for lease accounting. This new standard requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements including the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and will require modified retrospective application as of the beginning of the earliest year presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."   This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB amended the effective date of this ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ,  ASU 2016-10    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ,  and ASU 2016-12 "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  " which provide further clarifications to be considered when implementing ASU 2014-09. The Company plans to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2018. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  There are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that have had, or that the Company believes will have, a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE   4     DIVESTITURES 
    
  Hudson Information Technology (US) business (the "US IT business") 
    
  On June 15, 2015, the Company completed the sale (the "US IT Business Sale") of substantially all of the assets (excluding working capital) of its US IT business to Mastech, Inc. (the "Purchaser"). The completion of the US IT Business Sale was effective June 14, 2015. The US IT Business Sale was pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2015 (the "Agreement"), by and among the Company, Hudson Global Resources Management, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Purchaser. At the closing of the U.S. IT Business Sale, the Company received from the Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement the purchase price of   $16,977   in cash. The US IT business pre-tax loss in accordance with ASC No. 205 "Reporting Discontinued Operations" ("ASC 205") for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2015   was   $0   and   $130  , respectively. 
    
  On the US IT Business Sale, for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of   $15,918  , net of closing and other direct transaction costs. Income tax on the gain was   $11  . For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the gain is offset in full by net operating loss carryforwards. For state and local income tax purposes, the gain was mostly offset by net operating loss carryforwards. As the divestiture did not meet the requirements for classification as discontinued operations, the results of operations and the gain on sale is presented as a component of income (loss) from operations. 
    
  Netherlands business 
    
  On May 7, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement and completed the sale (the "Netherlands Business Sale") of its Netherlands business to InterBalance Group B.V., effective April 30, 2015, in a management buyout for   $9,029  , which included cash retained of   $1,135  . As the divestiture did not reach the thresholds required to qualify as discontinued operations, the operations remain within the Company's continuing operations for all periods presented. The Netherlands pre-tax profit in accordance with ASC 205 for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2015   was   $0   and   $373  , respectively. 
    
  Exit of Businesses in Central and Eastern Europe 
    
  In February 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved the exit of operations in certain countries within Central and Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia). During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the Company deemed the liquidation of its Central and Eastern Europe businesses to be substantially complete. As such, under ASC 830, "Foreign Currency Matters," for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company transferred   $4   and   $1,190   of accumulated foreign currency translation gains from accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations within gain on sale and exit of businesses.  
    
  Luxembourg 
    
  In March 2015, the Company's management approved the exit of operations in Luxembourg. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company deemed the liquidation of its Luxembourg business to be substantially complete. As such, under ASC 830, "Foreign Currency Matters," for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company transferred   $131   of accumulated foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations within gain on sale and exit of businesses.

NOTE   5     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  Effective November 9, 2014, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its Legal eDiscovery business in the U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") to Document Technologies, LLC and DTI of London Limited. In addition, in 2014, the Company ceased operations in Sweden, which was included within the Hudson Europe segment. The Company concluded that the divestiture of the Legal eDiscovery business and the cessation of operations in Sweden meet the criteria for discontinued operations set forth in ASC 205  .   The Company reclassified its discontinued operations for all periods presented and has excluded the results of its discontinued operations from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. 
    
  The carrying amounts of the classes of assets and liabilities from the Legal eDiscovery business and Sweden operations included in discontinued operations were as follows: 

(a)  Total liabilities primarily consisted of restructuring liabilities for lease termination payments. 
    
  Reported results for the discontinued operations by period were as follows:

NOTE   7     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Incentive Compensation Plan 
  The Company maintains the Hudson Global, Inc. 2009 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan, as amended and restated May 24, 2016 (the "ISAP"), pursuant to which it can issue equity-based compensation incentives to eligible participants. The ISAP permits the granting of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other types of equity-based awards. The Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") will establish such conditions as it deems appropriate on the granting or vesting of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other types of equity-based awards. As determined by the Compensation Committee, equity awards also may be subject to immediate vesting upon the occurrence of certain events following a change in control of the Company. The Company primarily grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to its employees. A restricted stock unit is equivalent to one share of the Company s common stock and is payable only in common stock of the Company issued under the ISAP. 
  The Compensation Committee administers the ISAP and may designate any of the following as a participant under the ISAP: any officer or other employee of the Company or its affiliates or individuals engaged to become an officer or employee; consultants or other independent contractors who provide services to the Company or its affiliates; and non-employee directors of the Company. On May 24, 2016, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the ISAP to, among other things, increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock that are reserved for issuance by   2,400,000   shares. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   2,567,135   shares of the Company s common stock available for future issuance under the ISAP.  
  The Company s stock plan agreements provide that a change in control of the Company will occur if, among other things, individuals who were directors as of the date of the agreement and any new director whose appointment or election was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then in office who were either directors on the date of the agreement or whose appointment or election was previously so approved or recommended (each, a  continuing director ) cease to constitute a majority of the Company s directors. A change in control occurred as of the Company's 2015 annual meeting of stockholders on June 15, 2015 under these agreements because continuing directors ceased to constitute a majority of the Company's directors. As a result, certain equity awards vested resulting in an accelerated stock-based compensation expense of   $2,541   for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015. 
  A summary of the quantity and vesting conditions for stock-based units granted to the Company's employees for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was as follows: 
                     Vesting conditions 
      
    Number of Restricted Stock Units Granted 
      Performance and service conditions (1) (2) 
      
    500,000 

(1) 
    The performance conditions with respect to restricted stock units may be satisfied as follows:  
              (a) 
    For employees from the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe   80%   of the restricted stock units may be earned on the basis of performance as measured by a "regional adjusted EBITDA," and   20%   of the restricted stock units may be earned on the basis of performance as measured by a "group adjusted EBITDA"; and  
              (b) 
    For employees from the Corporate office   100%   of the restricted stock units may be earned on the basis of performance as measured by a "group adjusted EBITDA." 
              (2) 
    To the extent restricted stock units are earned on the basis of performance, such restricted stock units will vest on the basis of service as follows: 
              (a) 
    One-third of the restricted stock units will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date;  
              (b) 
    One-third of the restricted stock units will vest on the second anniversary of the grant date; and 
              (c) 
    One-third of the restricted stock units will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date; provided that, in each case, the employee remains employed by the Company from the grant date through the applicable service vesting date.

The Company also maintains the Director Deferred Share Plan (the "Director Plan") pursuant to which it can issue restricted stock units to its non-employee directors. A restricted stock unit is equivalent to one share of the Company s common stock and is payable only in common stock issued under the ISAP upon a director ceasing service as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. The restricted stock units vest immediately upon grant and are credited to each of the non-employee director's retirement accounts under the Director Plan. Restricted stock units issued under the Director Plan contain the right to a dividend equivalent award in the form of additional restricted stock units. The dividend equivalent award is calculated using the same rate as the cash dividend paid on a share of the Company's common stock, and then divided by the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date the dividend is paid to determine the number of additional restricted stock units to grant. Dividend equivalent awards have the same vesting terms as the underlying awards. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   212,440   restricted stock units to its non-employee directors pursuant to the Director Plan.  
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company s stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units were as follows:   

Stock Options 
  Stock options granted by the Company generally expire between five and ten years after the date of grant and have an exercise price of at least   100%   of the fair market value of the underlying share of common stock on the date of grant. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $2   of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested stock options. The Company expects to recognize that cost over a weighted average service period of   0.10   years. 
  Changes in the Company s stock options for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015   were as follows:

NOTE 8   INCOME TAXES 
  Under ASC 270, "  Interim Reporting"  , and ASC 740-270, "  Income Taxes   Intra Period Tax Allocation"  , the Company is required to adjust its effective tax rate for each quarter to be consistent with the estimated annual effective tax rate. Jurisdictions with a projected loss for the full year where no tax benefit can be recognized are excluded from the calculation of the estimated annual effective tax rate. Applying the provisions of ASC 270 and ASC 740-270 could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter, based upon the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections. 
  Effective Tax Rate 
  The   provision for   income taxes for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1,200   on a pre-tax   loss   from continuing operations of   $7,625  , compared to a   benefit from   income taxes of   $1,317   on pre-tax   income   from continuing operations of   $2,774   for the same period in   2015  . The Company s effective income tax rate was negative   15.7%   and negative   47.5%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to the inability of the Company to recognize tax benefits on certain losses until positive earnings are achieved in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions, a decrease in tax benefits that were previously recognized, non-deductible expenses, and variations from the U.S. tax rate in foreign jurisdictions. For the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% due to the utilization of U.S. tax losses not previously recognized as tax benefits to offset gain on sale of business, foreign tax exemptions applicable to gains on sale or exit of businesses, the inability of the Company to recognize tax benefits on losses until positive earnings are achieved in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, and variations from the U.S. tax rate in foreign jurisdictions. 
  Uncertain Tax Positions    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $2,246   and   $2,279  , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, which if recognized in the future, would lower the Company s annual effective income tax rate. Accrued interest and penalties were   $577   and   $536   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Estimated interest and penalties are classified as part of the provision for income taxes in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled to a   provision of     $31   and   $53   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  In many cases, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. Tax years with net operating losses ("NOLs") remain open until such losses expire or until the statutes of limitations for those years when the NOLs are used expire. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's open tax years, which remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities, were principally as follows:                      
      
    Year 
      Earliest tax years which remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities: 

U.S. Federal 
      
    2013 
      Majority of U.S. state and local jurisdictions 
      
    2012

      Australia 
      
    2012 
      Majority of other non-U.S. jurisdictions 
      
    2011 

The Company believes that its tax reserves are adequate for all years that remain subject to examination or are currently under examination. 
  Based on information available as of   September 30, 2016  , it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the range of   $200   to   $500   over the next   12   months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies and potential expirations of the applicable statutes of limitations.

NOTE 9   EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the Company s net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. When the effects are not anti-dilutive, diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the Company s net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and the impact of all dilutive potential common shares, primarily stock options "in-the-money", unvested restricted stock and unvested restricted stock units. The dilutive impact of stock options, unvested restricted stock, and unvested restricted stock units is determined by applying the "treasury stock" method. Performance-based restricted stock awards are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions: (i) are satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period; or (ii) would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related performance period and the result would be dilutive under the treasury stock method. Stock awards subject to vesting or exercisability based on the achievement of market conditions are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share only when the market conditions are met. 
  A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

(a) 
    For the periods in which net losses are presented, the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding did not differ from the basic weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding because the effects of any potential common stock equivalents (see Note   7   for further details on outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock units and unvested restricted stock) were anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the calculation of the denominator of dilutive earnings per share.

NOTE 12   GOODWILL 
  The following is a summary of the changes in the carrying value of the Company s goodwill, which was included under the caption "Other Assets" in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The goodwill related to the earn-out payment made in 2010 for the Company s 2007 acquisition of the businesses of Tong Zhi (Beijing) Consulting Service Ltd and Guangzhou Dong Li Consulting Service Ltd. The goodwill is recorded in the Asia Pacific segment.  

As a result of continued unfavorable financial performance in the Company's China reporting unit, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. As such, the Company performed an interim test for impairment of goodwill as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach which valued the reporting unit based on the future cash flows expected from the reporting unit. The Company's estimated fair value of its China reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value. As such, the Company concluded goodwill was not impaired as of the interim reporting date.

NOTE   14     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Consulting, Employment and Non-compete Agreements 
  The Company has entered into various consulting and employment agreements with certain key members of management. These agreements generally (i) are one year in length, (ii) contain restrictive covenants, (iii) under certain circumstances, provide for compensation and, subject to providing the Company with a release, severance payments, and (iv) are automatically renewed annually unless either party gives sufficient notice of termination. 
  Litigation and Complaints    
  The Company is subject, from time to time, to various claims, lawsuits, contracts disputes and other complaints from, for example, clients, candidates, suppliers, landlords for both leased and subleased properties, former and current employees, and regulators or tax authorities arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company routinely monitors claims such as these, and records provisions for losses when the claim becomes probable and the amount due is estimable. Although the outcome of these claims cannot be determined, the Company believes that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
  For matters that have reached the threshold of probable and estimable, the Company has established reserves for legal, regulatory and other contingent liabilities. The Company s reserves were   $112   and   $109   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Costs Associated with Termination 
  As previously disclosed, in May 2015, the Company incurred compensation and benefits obligations to its former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Manuel Marquez, under his employment agreement, dated March 7, 2011, in connection with the Company providing Mr. Marquez notice of non-renewal of his employment agreement, which is treated as a termination without cause. The Company had accrued   $747   as of March 31, 2016 in connection with compensation and benefits Mr. Marquez was entitled to upon a termination without cause, subject to his execution of a release. Mr. Marquez did not agree with the Company s treatment of compensation and benefits under his employment agreement and, in August 2015, filed an arbitration claim against the Company for additional amounts of up to approximately   $2,000   and reimbursement of his legal fees. 
       On May 27, 2016, the arbitrator issued his decision on Mr. Marquez s claim and awarded Mr. Marquez approximately   $1,800   in additional compensation and benefits and approximately   $700   toward the reimbursement of a portion of his legal fees incurred pursuing his claim. For the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , the Company recorded an additional charge of   $0   and   $3,025  , respectively for the resolution of this arbitration. 
                Asset Retirement Obligations    
  The Company has certain asset retirement obligations that are primarily the result of legal obligations for the removal of leasehold improvements and restoration of premises to their original condition upon termination of leases. The asset retirement obligations are included under the caption "Other non-current liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s asset retirement obligations that are included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

NOTE 15   CREDIT AGREEMENTS 
    
  Receivables Finance Agreement with Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Limited and Lloyds Bank PLC 
    
  On August 1, 2014, the Company s U.K. subsidiary ("U.K. Borrower") entered into a receivables finance agreement for an asset-based lending funding facility (the "Lloyds Agreement") with Lloyds Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Limited (together, "Lloyds"). Until September 15, 2016, the Lloyds Agreement provided the U.K. Borrower with the ability to borrow up to   $19,464   (   15,000  ), at which time the U.K. Borrower entered into an amendment to the Lloyds Agreement that reduced the borrowing limit to   $15,571   (   12,000  ). Extensions of credit are based on a percentage of the eligible accounts receivable less required reserves from the Company's U.K. operations. The initial term was two years with renewal periods every three months thereafter. Borrowings under this facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the U.K. Borrower. 
    
  The credit facility under the Lloyds Agreement contains two tranches. The first tranche is a revolving facility based on the billed temporary contracting and permanent recruitment activities in the U.K. operations ("Lloyds Tranche A"). The borrowing limit of Lloyds Tranche A is   $14,922   (   11,500  ) and is based on   83%   of eligible billed temporary contracting and permanent recruitment receivables. The second tranche is a revolving facility that is based on the unbilled work-in-progress (as defined under the receivables finance agreement) activities in the Company's U.K. operations ("Lloyds Tranche B"). The borrowing limit of Lloyds Tranche B is   $649   (   500  ) and is based on   25%   of eligible work-in-progress from permanent recruitment activities. For both tranches, borrowings may be made with an interest rate based on a base rate as determined by Lloyds Bank PLC, based on the Bank of England base rate, plus   1.75%  .  
    
  The Lloyds Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants including (1) that true credit note dilution may not exceed   5%  , measured at audit on a regular basis; (2) debt turn may not exceed   55   days over a three month rolling period; (3) dividends by the U.K. Borrower to the Company are restricted to the value of post-tax profits; and (4) at the end of each month, there must be a minimum excess availability of   $2,595   (   2,000  ). 
  The details of the Lloyds Agreement as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

NOTE   18     SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA 
  Segment Reporting 
  The Company operates in   three   reportable segments: the Hudson regional businesses of Hudson Americas, Hudson Asia Pacific, and Hudson Europe. Corporate expenses are reported separately from the   three   reportable segments and pertain to certain functions, such as executive management, corporate governance, human resources, accounting, administration, tax and treasury, the majority of which are attributable to and have been allocated to the reportable segments. Segment information is presented in accordance with ASC 280, "  Segments Reporting."   This standard is based on a management approach that requires segmentation based upon the Company s internal organization and disclosure of revenue and certain expenses based upon internal accounting methods. The Company s financial reporting systems present various data for management to run the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. Accounts receivable, net and long-lived assets are the only significant assets separated by segment for internal reporting purposes.

Current Market Conditions 
  Economic conditions in most of the world's major markets remain mixed. In the U.K., the June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (commonly referred to as  Brexit ) adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in a decline in the value of the British pound as compared to the U.S. dollar. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of the Company's U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The Company's U.K. operations, future financial performance and translation of results may be affected, in part, by the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union. 
  Conditions in Continental Europe have shown improvement with GDP growth in most of the major markets, as well as forecasted GDP growth for the remainder of   2016  . Australia faces a slow growth outlook for the remainder of   2016  , while the outlook for Asia is uncertain given China's slowing growth outlook.  
  The Company closely monitors the economic environment and business climate in its markets and responds accordingly. At this time, the Company is unable to accurately predict the outcome of these events or changes in general economic conditions and their effect on the demand for the Company's services. 
  Financial Performance 
  The Company achieved mixed financial performance for the   third   quarter of   2016   in most of the major markets in which it operates. On a constant currency basis, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenue increased by   $1.7 million  , or   1.6%  , and gross margin declined by   $0.6 million  , or   1.4%  , respectively, compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  The changes in revenue and gross margin were driven by strong results in Australia, the Americas and Continental Europe and declines in revenue and gross margin in the U.K. and China. 
    
  The following is a summary of the highlights for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . This summary should be considered in the context of the additional disclosures in this MD A which further highlight the results by segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a primary driver of the difference from the same period in 2015 was the prior year divestitures of the Netherlands, US I.T., Luxembourg and Central and Eastern Europe businesses.  

On a constant currency basis, the Company's revenue   increased     $1.7 million  , or   1.6%  , mainly due to an increase of   $2.6 million   in contracting revenue (up   3.8%   compared to the same period in   2015  ) and partially offset by a decrease of   $1.2 million   in permanent recruitment revenue (down   3.9%   compared to the same period in   2015  ). 
                 
    On a constant currency basis, the Company's revenue   decreased     $20.3 million  , or   5.9%  , mainly due to decreases of   $18.3 million   in contracting revenue (down   8.1%   compared to the same period in   2015  ) and   $2.9 million   in permanent recruitment revenue (down   3.3%   compared to the same period in   2015  ) partially offset by an increase of   $0.9 million   in talent management revenue (up   3.2%   compared to the same period in   2015  ). 
                 
    On a constant currency basis, gross margin   decreased     $0.6 million  , or   1.4%  , mainly due to a decrease of   $0.9 million   in permanent recruitment gross margin (down   3.3%   compared to the same period in 2015) partially offset by an increase of   $0.1 million   in talent management gross margin (up   2.2%   compared to the same period in   2015  ). Temporary recruitment gross margin remained flat, as compared to the same period in 2015. 
                 
    On a constant currency basis, gross margin   decreased     $7.2 million  , or   5.2%  , mainly due to decreases of   $5.5 million   in temporary recruitment gross margin (down   17.1%   compared to the same period in   2015  )

    Selling, general and administrative expenses and other non-operating income (expense) ("SG A and Non-Op") were   $43.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $45.3 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   a decrease   of   $1.7 million  , or   3.7%  . 
                   
    Business reorganization expenses were   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.3 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $2.1 million  . On a constant currency basis, business reorganization expenses   decreased     $2.1 million  . 
                
    Business reorganization expenses were   $1.0 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.7 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $4.7 million  . On a constant currency basis, business reorganization expenses   decreased     $4.6 million  . 
                
    EBITDA loss   was   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   EBITDA loss   of   $2.6 million   for the same period in   2015  , an increase in EBITDA of   $2.3 million  . On a constant currency basis, EBITDA increased   $2.1 million  .  
                 
    Net loss   was   $1.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net loss of   $2.1 million   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease in net loss of   $0.2 million  . On a constant currency basis, net loss was unchanged. 
      Constant Currency 
  The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of its gross margin generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the Company's results of operations. For the discussion of reportable segment results of operations, the Company uses constant currency information. Constant currency compares financial results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company defines the term "constant currency" to mean that financial data for a previously reported period are translated into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate financial data for the current period. The Company s management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currency and believes these results better represent the Company s underlying business trends. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates generally impact only reported earnings. 
  Changes in revenue, gross margin, SG A and Non-Op, business reorganization expenses, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and EBITDA (loss) from continuing operations include the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The tables below summarize the impact of foreign currency exchange adjustments on the Company s operating results for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .

Use of EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) 
  Management believes EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of the Company s performance that provides useful information to investors regarding the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Management also considers EBITDA to be the best indicator of operating performance and most comparable measure across the regions in which the Company operates. Management also uses this measure to evaluate capital needs and working capital requirements. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, or net income prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") or as a measure of the Company s profitability. EBITDA is derived from net income (loss) adjusted for the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, interest expense (income), and depreciation and amortization. 
    
  The reconciliation of EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the table below:

Temporary Contracting Data 
  The following table sets forth the Company s temporary contracting revenue, gross margin, and gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  

(a) 
    Temporary contracting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of revenue are shown to provide additional information regarding the Company s ability to manage its cost structure and to provide further comparability relative to the Company's peers. Temporary contracting gross margin is derived by deducting the direct costs of temporary contracting from temporary contracting revenue. The Company s calculation of gross margin may differ from that of other companies. See Note   6   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for direct costs and gross margin information.

  Revenue      

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , permanent recruitment revenue increased   $0.5 million  , or   16.5%  , as a result of growth in RPO, as compared to the same period in   2015  .

The decrease in temporary contracting revenue was directly attributable to the divestiture of the Company's US IT business in June 2015. For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , permanent recruitment revenue increased   $0.8 million  , or   8.2%  , as a result of growth in RPO, as compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  Gross Margin 

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , permanent recruitment gross margin increased   $0.5 million  , or   16.1%  , as a result of growth in RPO, as compared to the same period in   2015  .

SG A and Non-Op  

For the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , SG A and Non-Op decreased   $0.2 million  , or   5.9%  , as compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower occupancy and support costs.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , SG A and Non-Op decreased   $5.1 million  , or   33.7%  , as compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower sales and administrative costs as a result of the prior year divestiture of the U.S. IT business and lower support costs. The decline was also driven by the change in control stock-based compensation expense of   $0.4 million   recorded in June 2015.

  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense was   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30,     2016  , as compared to   $1.0 million   for the same period in   2015  , a decrease of   $0.2 million  , or   16.1%  .

For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the inability of the Company to recognize tax benefits on certain losses until positive earnings are achieved in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions, a decrease in tax benefits that were previously recognized, non-deductible expenses, and variations from the U.S. tax rate in foreign jurisdictions. For the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% due to the utilization of U.S. tax losses not previously recognized as tax benefits to offset gain on sale of business, foreign tax exemptions applicable to gains on sale or exit of businesses, the inability of the Company to recognize tax benefits on losses until positive earnings are achieved in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, and variations from the U.S. tax rate in foreign jurisdictions.

  On August 1, 2014, the Company s U.K. subsidiary ("U.K. Borrower") entered into a receivables finance agreement for an asset-based lending funding facility (the "Lloyds Agreement") with Lloyds Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Limited (together, "Lloyds"). Until September 15, 2016, the Lloyds Agreement provided the U.K. Borrower with the ability to borrow up to   $19.5 million   (   15.0 million  ), at which time the U.K. Borrower entered into an amendment to the Lloyds Agreement that reduced the borrowing limit to   $15.6 million   (   12.0 million  ). Extensions of credit are based on a percentage of the eligible accounts receivable less required reserves from the Company's U.K. operations. The initial term was two years with renewal periods every three months thereafter. Borrowings under this facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the U.K. Borrower. 
    
  The credit facility under the Lloyds Agreement contains two tranches. The first tranche is a revolving facility based on the billed temporary contracting and permanent recruitment activities in the U.K. operations ("Lloyds Tranche A"). The borrowing limit of Lloyds Tranche A is   $14.9 million   (   11.5 million  ) and is based on   83%   of eligible billed temporary contracting and permanent recruitment receivables. The second tranche is a revolving facility that is based on the unbilled work-in-progress (as defined under the receivables finance agreement) activities in the Company's U.K. operations ("Lloyds Tranche B"). The borrowing limit of Lloyds Tranche B is   $0.6 million   (   0.5 million  ) and is based on   25%   of eligible work-in-

progress from permanent recruitment activities. For both tranches, borrowings may be made with an interest rate based on a base rate as determined by Lloyds Bank PLC, based on the Bank of England base rate, plus   1.75%  .  
    
  The Lloyds Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants including (1) that true credit note dilution may not exceed   5%  , measured at audit on a regular basis; (2) debt turn may not exceed   55   days over a three month rolling period; (3) dividends by the U.K. Borrower to the Company are restricted to the value of post-tax profits; and (4) at the end of each month, there must be a minimum excess availability of   $2.6 million   (   2.0 million  ). 
  The details of the Lloyds Agreement as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Lloyds Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Facility Agreement with National Australia Bank Limited 
    
  On October 30, 2015, Hudson Global Resources (Aust) Pty Limited ("Hudson Australia") and Hudson Global Resources (NZ) Limited ("Hudson New Zealand"), both subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Finance Agreement, dated as of October 27, 2015 (the "Finance Agreement"), with National Australia Bank Limited ("NAB"), a NAB Corporate Receivables Facility Agreement, dated as of October 27, 2015 (the "Australian Receivables Agreement"), with NAB and a BNZ Corporate Receivables Facility Agreement, dated as of October 27, 2015 (the "New Zealand Receivables Agreement"), with Bank of New Zealand ("BNZ"). 
    
  The Finance Agreement provides a bank guarantee facility of up to   $2.3 million   (AUD   3.0 million  ) for Hudson Australia and Hudson New Zealand. The Finance Agreement matures and becomes due and payable on October 27, 2018. A fee equal to   1.5%   per annum will be charged on each bank guarantee issued under the Finance Agreement. The Finance Agreement bears a fee, payable semiannually in arrears, equal to   0.3%   per annum of NAB s commitment under the Finance Agreement.  
    
  The Australian Receivables Agreement provides a receivables facility of up to   $19.2 million   (AUD   25.0 million  ) for Hudson Australia, which is based on an agreed percentage of eligible accounts receivable, and of which up to   $3.1 million   (AUD   4.0 million  ) may be used to support the working capital requirements of operations in China, Hong Kong and Singapore. The Australian Receivables Agreement does not have a stated maturity date and can be terminated by Hudson Australia or NAB upon   90 days   written notice. Borrowings under the Australian Receivables Agreement may be made with an interest rate based on a market rate plus a margin of   1.5%   per annum. The Australian Receivable Agreement bears a fee, payable monthly in advance, equal to   $5 thousand   (AUD   6 thousand  ) per month. 
    
  The New Zealand Receivables Agreement provides a receivables facility of up to   $3.6 million   (NZD   5.0 million  ) for Hudson New Zealand, which is based on an agreed percentage of eligible accounts receivable. The New Zealand Receivables Agreement does not have a stated maturity date and can be terminated by Hudson New Zealand or BNZ upon   90 days   written notice. Borrowings under the New Zealand Receivables Agreement may be made with an interest rate based on a market rate. The New Zealand Receivables Agreement bears a fee, payable monthly in advance, equal to   $1 thousand   (NZD   1 thousand  ) per month.

Amounts owing under the Finance Agreement, the Australian Receivables Agreement and the New Zealand Receivables Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of Hudson Australia and Hudson New Zealand. Each of the Finance Agreement, the Australian Receivables Agreement and the New Zealand Receivables Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to Hudson Australia and Hudson New Zealand, including: a requirement that Hudson Australia and Hudson New Zealand maintain (1) a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the NAB Facility Agreement) of   1.50  x as of the last day of each calendar quarter; and (2) a minimum Receivables Ratio (as defined by the NAB Facility Agreement) of   1.20  x. 
    
  The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the NAB Facility Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other Credit Agreements 
  The Company also has lending arrangements with local banks through its subsidiaries in Belgium and Singapore. The Belgium subsidiary has a   $1.1 million   (   1.0 million  ) overdraft facility. Borrowings under the Belgium lending arrangements may be made with an interest rate based on the one-month EURIBOR plus a margin, and was   2.75%   as of   September 30, 2016  . The lending arrangement in Belgium has no expiration date and can be terminated with a 15-day notice period. In Singapore, the Company s subsidiary can borrow up to   $0.1 million   (SGD   0.2 million  ) for working capital purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Singapore overdraft facility is based on the Singapore Prime Rate plus a margin of 1.75%, and it was   6.00%   on   September 30, 2016  . The Singapore overdraft facility expires annually each August, but can be renewed for one-year periods at that time. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Belgium and Singapore lending agreements as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The average aggregate monthly outstanding borrowings for the credit agreements above was   $9.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  . The weighted average interest rate on all outstanding borrowings for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   was   3.45%  . 
  The Company continues to use the aforementioned credit to support its ongoing global working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to support letters of credit. Letters of credit and bank guarantees are used primarily to support office leases.

Liquidity Outlook 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of   $17.4 million  , supplemented by additional borrowing availability of   $19.1 million   under the Lloyds Agreement, the NAB Facility Agreement and other lending arrangements in Belgium and Singapore. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs through at least the next 12 months, based on the Company's total liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company's near-term cash requirements during   2016   are primarily related to funding operations, restructuring actions, investing in capital expenditures and repurchasing shares. For the full year   2016  , the Company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million and payments in connection with current restructuring actions of $3.0 million to $4.0 million.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $2.7 million   of the Company's cash and cash equivalents noted above were held in the U.S. and the remainder were held outside the U.S., primarily in Belgium (  $3.9 million  ), Mainland China (  $2.3 million  ), Spain (  $1.7 million  ), the U.K. (  $1.4 million  ), Hong Kong (  $1.4 million  ), New Zealand (  $1.1 million  ), France (  $0.9 million  ) and Australia (  $0.7 million  ). The majority of the Company's offshore cash is available to it as a source of funds, net of any tax obligations or assessments. Unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are considered to be invested indefinitely outside of the U.S., except where the Company is able to repatriate these earnings to the U.S. without a material incremental tax provision. In managing its day-to-day liquidity and its capital structure, the Company does not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds. The Company has not provided for U.S. Federal income or foreign withholding taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings because a distribution of these foreign earnings with material incremental tax provision is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future. It is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings. 
    
  The Company believes that future external market conditions remain uncertain, particularly access to credit, rates of near-term projected economic growth and levels of unemployment in the markets in which the Company operates. Due to these uncertain external market conditions, the Company cannot provide assurance that its actual cash requirements will not be greater in the future than those currently expected, especially if market conditions deteriorate substantially. If sources of liquidity are not available or if the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations, the Company could be required to obtain additional sources of funds through additional operating improvements, capital market transactions, asset sales or financing from third parties, or a combination of those sources. The Company cannot provide assurance that these additional sources of funds will be available or, if available, would have reasonable terms. 

Contingencies 
  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to compliance audits by federal, state, local and foreign government regulatory, tax and other authorities relating to a variety of regulations, including wage and hour laws, unemployment taxes, workers' compensation, immigration, and income, value-added and sales taxes. The Company is also subject to, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, various claims, lawsuits and other complaints from, for example, clients, candidates, suppliers, landlords for both leased and subleased properties, former and current employees, and regulators or tax authorities. In addition, see Note 14 for a description of a dispute and the subsequent resolution between the Company and its former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Periodic events and management actions such as business reorganization initiatives can change the number and type of audits, claims, lawsuits, contract disputes or complaints asserted against the Company. Events can also change the likelihood of assertion and the behavior of third parties to reach resolution regarding such matters. 
  The economic circumstances in the recent past have given rise to many news reports and bulletins from clients, tax authorities and other parties about changes in their procedures for audits, payment, plans to challenge existing contracts and other such matters aimed at being more aggressive in the resolution of such matters in their own favor. The Company believes that it has appropriate procedures in place for identifying and communicating any matters of this type, whether asserted or likely to be asserted, and it evaluates its liabilities in light of the prevailing circumstances. Changes in the behavior of third parties could cause the Company to change its view of the likelihood of a claim and what might constitute a trend. Employment laws vary in the markets in which we operate, and in some cases, employees and former employees have extended periods during which they may bring claims against the Company.  
  For matters that have reached the threshold of probable and estimable, the Company has established reserves for legal, regulatory and other contingent liabilities. The Company s reserves were   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined, the Company believes that none of the currently pending matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  The Company conducts operations in various countries and faces both translation and transaction risks related to foreign currency exchange. For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , the Company earned approximately   92%   of its gross margin outside the U.S., and it collected payments in local currency and paid related operating expenses in such corresponding local currency. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in U.S. dollars as the U.S. dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. dollars) from foreign operations. 
  Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders  equity section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The translation of foreign currency into U.S. dollars is reflected as a component of stockholders' equity and does not impact our reported net income (loss).  
  The Brexit referendum resulted in a decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar. The Company's U.K. operations, future financial performance and translation of results may be affected, in part, by the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union. 
  As more fully described in Item 2 "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the Company has credit agreements with Lloyds Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Limited, National Australia Bank Limited and other credit agreements with lenders in Belgium and Singapore. The Company does not hedge the interest risk on borrowings under the credit agreements, and accordingly, it is exposed to interest rate risk on the borrowings under such credit agreements. Based on the Company's annual average borrowings in the current year, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on the Company's borrowings would not have a material impact on the Company's earnings. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  CERTIFICATIONS 
    
  I, Stephen A. Nolan, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Hudson Global, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

              5.

              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
