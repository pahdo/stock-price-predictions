  (Unaudited)  

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these unaudited
consolidated financial statements. 

Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  

1. BASIS OF INTERIM PRESENTATION  

The consolidated financial information included herein, with the
exception of the consolidated balance sheet dated December 31, 2015, is unaudited. Such information reflects all adjustments (consisting
solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders  equity for the interim periods;
however, the information does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for a complete set of financial statements. Certain 2015 information has been reclassified
for consistency with the 2016 presentation. 

Operating results reported for the three-month and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 might not be indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2016. The Corporation evaluates
subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

2. PER SHARE DATA  

Net income per share is based on the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding. The following data show the amounts used in computing basic and diluted net income per share.
As shown in the table that follows, diluted earnings per share is computed using weighted average common shares outstanding, plus
weighted-average common shares available from the exercise of all dilutive stock options, less the number of shares that could
be repurchased with the proceeds of stock option exercises based on the average share price of the Corporation's common stock
during the period. 

Stock options that were anti-dilutive were excluded from net income
per share calculations. Weighted-average common shares available from anti-dilutive instruments totaled 39,054 shares in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, 66,351 shares in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, 22,715 shares in the third quarter
2016 and 47,974 shares in the third quarter 2015. 

3. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  

Comprehensive income is the total of (1) net income, and (2) all
other changes in equity from non-stockholder sources, which are referred to as other comprehensive income. The components of other
comprehensive income, and the related tax effects, are as follows:

4. CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS  

Cash and due from banks at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 include the following: 

Certificates of deposit are issues by U.S. banks with original
maturities greater than three months. Each certificate of deposit is fully FDIC-insured. The Corporation maintains cash and cash
equivalents with certain financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. 

The Corporation is required to maintain reserves against deposit
liabilities in the form of cash and balances with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The reserves are based on deposit
levels, account activity, and other services provided by the Federal Reserve Bank. Required reserves were $13,141,000 at September
30, 2016 and $15,327,000 at December 31, 2015. 

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

The Corporation measures certain assets at fair value. Fair value
is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  establishes
a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs used in determining valuations into three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the
fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets that are accessible to the Corporation for identical assets. These generally provide the most reliable evidence
and are used to measure fair value whenever available. 

Level 2   Fair value is based on significant inputs, other
than Level 1 inputs, that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset through corroboration
with observable market data. Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets, quoted market prices
in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets and other observable inputs. 

Level 3   Fair value is based on significant unobservable
inputs. Examples of valuation methodologies that would result in Level 3 classification include option pricing models, discounted
cash flows and other similar techniques. 

The Corporation monitors and evaluates available data relating
to fair value measurements on an ongoing basis and recognizes transfers among the levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the
date of an event or change in circumstances that affects the valuation method chosen. Examples of such changes may include the
market for a particular asset becoming active or inactive, changes in the availability of quoted prices, or changes in the availability
of other market data. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, assets measured at
fair value and the valuation methods used are as follows: 

Management s evaluation and selection of valuation techniques
and the unobservable inputs used in determining the fair values of assets valued using Level 3 methodologies include sensitive
assumptions. Other market participants might use substantially different assumptions, which could result in calculations of fair
values that would be substantially different than the amount calculated by management. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, quantitative information
regarding significant techniques and inputs used for assets measured on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3 methodologies)
are as follows: 

The fair value of servicing rights is affected by expected future
interest rates. Increases (decreases) in future expected interest rates tend to increase (decrease) the fair value of the Corporation s
servicing rights because of changes in expected prepayment behavior by the borrowers on the underlying loans. 

Following is a reconciliation of activity for Level 3 assets measured
at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current information
and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Foreclosed assets held for sale consist of real estate acquired
by foreclosure. For impaired commercial loans secured by real estate and foreclosed assets held for sale, estimated fair values
are determined primarily using values from third-party appraisals. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated
selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs
to sell the property. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, quantitative information
regarding significant techniques and inputs used for nonrecurring fair value measurements using unobservable inputs (Level 3 methodologies)
are as follows: 

Certain of the Corporation s financial instruments are not
measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions
used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized
in an immediate settlement of the instrument. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from
disclosure requirements. Therefore, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not represent the underlying fair value of
the Corporation. 

The Corporation used the following methods and assumptions in estimating
fair value disclosures for financial instruments: 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -  The carrying amounts of cash
and short-term instruments approximate fair values. 

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT -  Fair values for certificates of
deposit, included in cash and due from banks in the consolidated balance sheet, are based on quoted market prices for certificates
of similar remaining maturities. 

SECURITIES -  Fair values for securities, excluding restricted
equity securities, are based on quoted market prices or other methods as described above. The carrying value of restricted equity
securities approximates fair value based on applicable redemption provisions. 

LOANS HELD FOR SALE -  Fair values of loans held for sale
are determined based on applicable sale prices available under the Federal Home Loan Banks  MPF Xtra and MPF Original programs. 

LOANS -  Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans
with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage
and other consumer. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and
nonperforming categories. The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows, adjusted for
estimated prepayments based on historical experience, using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest
rate risk inherent in the loans. Fair value of nonperforming loans is based on recent appraisals or estimates prepared by the
Corporation s lending officers. 

SERVICING RIGHTS -  The fair value of servicing rights, included
in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet, is determined through a discounted cash flow valuation. Significant inputs
include expected net servicing income, the discount rate and the expected prepayment speeds of the underlying loans. 

DEPOSITS -  The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity,
such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings, money market and interest checking accounts, is (by definition) equal to
the amount payable on demand at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The fair value of time deposits, such as certificates
of deposit and Individual Retirement Accounts, is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is
estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value estimates of deposits
do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of
borrowing funds in the market, commonly referred to as the core deposit intangible. 

BORROWED FUNDS -  The fair value of borrowings is estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses based on rates currently available to the Corporation for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 

ACCRUED INTEREST -  The carrying amounts of accrued interest
receivable and payable approximate fair values. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS -  The Corporation has commitments
to extend credit and has issued standby letters of credit. Standby letters of credit are conditional guarantees of performance
by a customer to a third party. Estimates of the fair value of these off-balance sheet items were not made because of the short-term
nature of these arrangements and the credit standing of the counterparties. 

The estimated fair values, and related carrying amounts, of the
Corporation s financial instruments are as follows: 

6. SECURITIES  

Amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows: 

The following table presents gross unrealized losses and fair value
of available-for-sale securities with unrealized loss positions that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated
by length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015: 

Gross realized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities
were as follows: 

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities
by contractual maturity are shown in the following table as of September 30, 2016. Actual maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because counterparties may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The Corporation s mortgage-backed securities have stated
maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers  ability to prepay obligations. Cash flows from such
investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest
rates. In the table above, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are shown in one period. 

Investment securities carried at $221,427,000 at September 30,
2016 and $228,616,000 at December 31, 2015 were pledged as collateral for public deposits, trusts and certain other deposits as
provided by law. See Note 8 for information concerning securities pledged to secure borrowing arrangements. 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment
(OTTI) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. Consideration
is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition
and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) whether the Corporation intends to sell the security or more likely than not will
be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. 

A summary of information management considered in evaluating debt
and equity securities for OTTI at September 30, 2016 is provided below. 

Debt Securities  

At September 30, 2016, management performed an assessment for possible
OTTI of the Corporation s debt securities on an issue-by-issue basis, relying on information obtained from various sources,
including publicly available financial data, ratings by external agencies, brokers and other sources. The extent of individual
analysis applied to each security depended on the size of the Corporation s investment, as well as management s perception
of the credit risk associated with each security. Based on the results of the assessment, management believes impairment of debt
securities at September 30, 2016 to be temporary. 

Equity Securities  

The Corporation s marketable equity securities at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted exclusively of stocks of banking companies. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation held
no stocks with an unrealized loss. 

The Corporation realized gains from sales of bank stocks totaling
$560,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and $837,000 during the first nine months of 2016. There were no realized
gains or losses on bank stocks in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, while realized gains from sales of bank stocks
totaled $476,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

C N Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh
(FHLB-Pittsburgh), which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. As a member, C N Bank is required to purchase and
maintain stock in FHLB-Pittsburgh. There is no active market for FHLB-Pittsburgh stock, and it must ordinarily be redeemed by
FHLB-Pittsburgh in order to be liquidated. C N Bank s investment in FHLB-Pittsburgh stock, included in Other Assets
in the consolidated balance sheet, was $3,230,000 at September 30, 2016 and $4,527,000 at December 31, 2015. The Corporation evaluated
its holding of FHLB-Pittsburgh stock for impairment and deemed the stock to not be impaired at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. In making this determination, management concluded that recovery of total outstanding par value, which equals the carrying
value, is expected. The decision was based on review of financial information that FHLB-Pittsburgh has made publicly available. 

7. LOANS  

The loans receivable portfolio is segmented into residential mortgage,
commercial and consumer loans. Loans outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized by segment, and by
classes within each segment, as follows: 

The Corporation grants loans to individuals as well as commercial
and tax-exempt entities. Commercial, residential and personal loans are made to customers geographically concentrated in the Pennsylvania
and New York counties that comprise the market serviced by Citizens   Northern Bank. Although the Corporation has a diversified
loan portfolio, a significant portion of its debtors  ability to honor their contracts is dependent on the local economic
conditions within the region. There is no concentration of loans to borrowers engaged in similar businesses or activities that
exceed 10% of total loans at either September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses that represents
management s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and recorded as a reduction
of the investment in loans. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that
can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based
on the Corporation s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect
the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current
economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that
may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In the process of evaluating the loan portfolio,
management also considers the Corporation s exposure to losses from unfunded loan commitments. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, management determined that no allowance for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was required. 

Transactions within the allowance for loan losses, summarized by
segment and class, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

In the evaluation of the loan portfolio, management determines
two major components for the allowance for loan losses   (1) a specific component based on an assessment of certain larger
relationships, mainly commercial purpose loans, on a loan-by-loan basis; and (2) a general component for the remainder of the
portfolio based on a collective evaluation of pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The general component is assigned
to each pool of loans based on both historical net charge-off experience, and an evaluation of certain qualitative factors. An
unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The
unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the above
methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. 

In determining the larger loan relationships for detailed assessment
under the specific allowance component, the Corporation uses an internal risk rating system. Under the risk rating system, the
Corporation classifies problem or potential problem loans as  Special Mention,   Substandard,  or  Doubtful 
on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct
possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as Doubtful have
all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make
collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loans that do not currently expose the Corporation to sufficient risk to warrant classification as Substandard or Doubtful, but
possess weaknesses that deserve management s close attention, are deemed to be Special Mention. Risk ratings are updated
any time that conditions or the situation warrants. Loans not classified are included in the  Pass  column in the
table below. 

The following tables summarize the aggregate credit quality classification
of outstanding loans by risk rating as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The general component of the allowance for loan losses covers pools
of loans including commercial loans not considered individually impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous classes of loans,
such as residential real estate, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. Accordingly, the Corporation generally
does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are subject
to a restructuring agreement. The pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon three-year average historical net
charge-off rates for each loan class, adjusted for qualitative factors. Qualitative risk factors (described in the following paragraph)
are evaluated for the impact on each of the three segments (residential mortgage, commercial and consumer) within the loan portfolio.
Each qualitative factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management s judgment
using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. The adjustment for qualitative factors is applied as an increase
or decrease to the three-year average net charge-off rate to each loan class within each segment. 

The qualitative factors used in the general component calculations
are designed to address credit risk characteristics associated with each segment. The Corporation s credit risk associated
with all of the segments is significantly impacted by these factors, which include economic conditions within its market area,
the Corporation s lending policies, changes or trends in the portfolio, risk profile, competition, regulatory requirements
and other factors. Further, the residential mortgage segment is significantly affected by the values of residential real estate
that provide collateral for the loans. The majority of the Corporation s commercial segment loans (approximately 56% at
September 30, 2016) is secured by real estate, and accordingly, the Corporation s risk for the commercial segment is significantly
affected by commercial real estate values. The consumer segment includes a wide mix of loans for different purposes, primarily
secured loans, including loans secured by motor vehicles, manufactured housing and other types of collateral. 

Loans are classified as impaired, when, based on current information
and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include
payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that
experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines
the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances
surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior
payment record and the amount of shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan
basis for commercial loans, by the fair value of the collateral (if the loan is collateral dependent), by future cash flows discounted
at the loan s effective rate or by the loan s observable market price. 

The scope of loans evaluated individually for impairment include
all loan relationships greater than $200,000 for which there is at least one extension of credit graded Special Mention, Substandard
or Doubtful. Also, all loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (discussed in more detail below) and all loan relationships
less than $200,000 in the aggregate, but with an estimated loss of $100,000 or more, are individually evaluated for impairment.
Loans that are individually evaluated for impairment, but which are not determined to be impaired, are combined with all remaining
loans that are not reviewed on a specific basis, and such loans are included within larger pools of loans based on similar risk
and loss characteristics for purposes of determining the general component of the allowance. The loans that have been individually
evaluated, but which have not been determined to be impaired, are included in the  Collectively Evaluated  column
in the tables summarizing the allowance and associated loan balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The following tables present a summary of loan balances and the
related allowance for loan losses summarized by portfolio segment and class for each impairment method used as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Summary information related to impaired loans at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

The average balance of impaired loans and interest income recognized
on impaired loans is as follows: 

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status for all classes of loans
when, in the opinion of management, collection of interest is doubtful. Any unpaid interest previously accrued on those loans
is reversed from income. Interest income is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is
remote. Interest payments received on loans for which the risk of further loss is greater than remote are applied as a reduction
of the loan principal balance. Interest income on other nonaccrual loans, including impaired loans, is recognized only to the
extent of interest payments received. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current,
has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time (generally six months) and the ultimate
collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. The past due status of all classes of loans
receivable is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments. Also, the amortization of deferred loan fees is discontinued
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. 

The breakdown by portfolio segment and class of nonaccrual loans
and loans past due ninety days or more and still accruing is as follows: 

The amounts shown in the table immediately above include loans
classified as troubled debt restructurings (described in more detail below), if such loans are past due ninety days or more or
nonaccrual. 

The table below presents a summary of the contractual aging of
loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Nonaccrual loans are included in the contractual aging in the immediately
preceding table. A summary of the contractual aging of nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

Loans whose terms are modified are classified as Troubled Debt
Restructurings (TDRs) if the Corporation grants such borrowers concessions, and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing
financial difficulty. Loans classified as TDRs are designated as impaired. The outstanding balance of loans subject to TDRs, as
well as contractual aging information at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

The TDR that occurred during the three-month period ended September
30, 2016 is as follows:

There were no TDRs that occurred during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015. 

The TDR in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 represented
a new, unsecured loan contract for $25,000. The new loan contract was entered into pursuant to a settlement agreement with a borrower
for whom the Corporation accepted a short fall from the sale of residential real estate as payment in full on a mortgage loan.
At September 30, 2016, there was no allowance for loan losses related to this TDR and there were no changes to the allowance for
loan losses related to this TDR in the third quarter 2016. 

TDRs that occurred during the nine-month periods ended September

The TDRs in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 included
an extension of a final maturity date and a lowered interest rate on one contract on a residential mortgage   first lien,
an extension of a final maturity date on a commercial and industrial loan, and establishment of an unsecured consumer loan contract
pursuant to a settlement agreement with a borrower for whom the Corporation accepted a short fall from the sale of residential
real estate as payment in full on a mortgage loan. In the third quarter 2016, a partial charge-off of $31,000 was recorded on
the residential mortgage  first lien. At September 30, 2016, there was no allowance for loan losses related to these TDRs,
and except for the partial charge-off on the residential mortgage   first lien, no changes in the allowance for loan losses
that resulted from these TDRs in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

The TDRs in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 included
an extended maturity date and a reduction in interest rate on a residential mortgage   first lien, a lowered interest rate
and reduced payment amount on a residential mortgage   junior lien and a lowered interest rate and reduced payment amount
on the consumer loan. There was no allowance for loan losses on these loans at September 30, 2015, and there was no change in
the allowance for loan losses that resulted from these TDRs. 

There were no defaults on loans for which modification considered
to be TDRs were entered into within the previous 12 months in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016.

class, timely payments were missed after interest rates and payment amounts were reduced on both loans; and (3) for the Commercial
and industrial loan, the borrower failed to pay off the loan at the extended maturity date. There was no allowance for loan losses
recorded on these loans at September 30, 2016. 

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, the events of
default in the table listed above resulted from the borrowers  failure to make timely payments under the following circumstances:
(1) for one customer relationship included in the Residential first lien mortgage class, payment was missed after the interest
rate and monthly payment amount had been reduced; (2) for the other customer relationship included in the Residential first lien
class, monthly payments were missed after reducing the monthly payments to interest only payments; and (3) for the Commercial
construction and land loan, monthly payments were missed after extending the term of maturity. There were no allowances for loan
losses recorded on these loans at September 30, 2015.

real properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process is as follows: 

8. BORROWED FUNDS  

Short-term borrowings include the following: 

Short-term borrowings from FHLB-Pittsburgh are as follows: 

The FHLB-Pittsburgh loan facilities are collateralized by qualifying
loans secured by real estate with a book value totaling $460,590,000 at September 30, 2016 and $450,883,000 at December 31, 2015.
Also, the FHLB-Pittsburgh loan facilities require the Corporation to invest in established amounts of FHLB-Pittsburgh stock. The
carrying values of the Corporation s holdings of FHLB-Pittsburgh stock (included in Other Assets) were $3,230,000 at September
30, 2016 and $4,527,000 at December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, short-term borrowings from the FHLB-Pittsburgh
include 3 advances of approximately $2,090,000 each, maturing monthly throughout the remainder of the year ending December 31,
2016, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.03% and rates ranging from 1.006% to 1.052%. In the first nine months of 2016,
the Corporation repaid nine advances of approximately $2,090,000 each, with a weighted average rate of 0.80%. 

The Corporation engages in repurchase agreements with certain commercial
customers. These agreements provide that the Corporation sells specified investment securities to the customers on an overnight
basis and repurchases them on the following business day. The weighted average interest rate paid by the Corporation on customer
repurchase agreements was 0.10% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The carrying value of the underlying securities was
$16,472,000 at September 30, 2016 and $12,613,000 at December 31, 2015. 

Long-term borrowings are as follows: 

Long-term borrowings from FHLB-Pittsburgh are as follows: 

The repurchase agreement included in long-term borrowings has an
interest rate of 3.595% and an effective maturity date in December 2017. 

The  Repurchase Date,  as defined in the Master Repurchase
Agreement between the Corporation and the broker-dealer, occurs quarterly on or about the 20 th  of each March, June,
September and December until the  Final Repurchase Date  (as defined) on December 20, 2017. The Corporation pays interest,
and the borrowing is putable by the issuer, on each Repurchase Date. The Final Repurchase Date is the effective maturity date
of the borrowing. 

Securities sold under repurchase agreements were delivered to the
broker-dealer who is the counter-party to the transactions. The broker-dealer may have sold, loaned or otherwise disposed of such
securities to other parties in the normal course of their operations, and has agreed to resell to the Corporation substantially
identical securities at the maturities of the agreements. The Master Repurchase Agreement provides that the Agreement constitutes
a  netting contract,  as defined; however, the Corporation and the broker-dealer have no other obligations to one
another and accordingly, no netting has occurred. 

The carrying value of the underlying securities was $34,130,000
at September30, 2016 and $33,780,000 at December 31, 2015, detailed in the following table: 

Two of the more significant risks associated with the repurchase
agreement with the broker-dealer are as follows: 

The
                                         borrowings are putable at quarterly intervals by the issuer. Accordingly, if interest
                                         rates were to rise to a sufficient level, the issuer would be expected to require the
                                         Corporation to pay off the borrowing. In this circumstance, the Corporation would be
                                         required to obtain a new borrowing at a higher interest rate than the existing repurchase
                                         agreement or utilize cash from other sources to pay off the borrowing. If sales of available-for-sale
                                         securities were used to generate cash to pay off the borrowing, the value of such securities
                                         would be expected to have fallen, which could result in the Corporation recognizing a
                                         loss.    

As
                                         principal pay-downs of mortgage backed securities and CMOs occur, the Corporation must
                                         have available, unencumbered assets or purchase a sufficient amount of assets with credit
                                         quality suitable to the broker-dealer to replace the amounts being paid off. Since pre-payments
                                         of mortgages typically increase as interest rates fall, the Corporation may be required
                                         to purchase additional assets at times when market rates are lower than the rates paid
                                         on the borrowing.    

The Corporation manages these risks by maintaining sufficient available
assets of acceptable credit quality, as well as maintaining other borrowing facilities, to meet ongoing collateral maintenance
requirements or pay off the borrowing if required. In particular, the Corporation had unused borrowing capacity available from
the FHLB-Pittsburgh of $315,685,000 at September 30, 2016. 

9. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS  

The Corporation sponsors a defined benefit health care plan that
provides postretirement medical benefits and life insurance to employees who meet certain age and length of service requirements.
Full-time employees no longer accrue service time toward the Corporation-subsidized portion of the medical benefits. This plan
contains a cost-sharing feature, which causes participants to pay for all future increases in costs related to benefit coverage.
Accordingly, actuarial assumptions related to health care cost trend rates do not significantly affect the liability balance at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and are not expected to significantly affect the Corporation's future expenses. The
Corporation uses a December 31 measurement date for the postretirement plan. 

In an acquisition in 2007, the Corporation assumed the Citizens
Trust Company Retirement Plan, a defined benefit pension plan. This plan covers certain employees who were employed by Citizens
Trust Company on December 31, 2002, when the plan was amended to discontinue admittance of any future participant and to freeze
benefit accruals. Information related to the Citizens Trust Company Retirement Plan has been included in the tables that follow.
The Corporation uses a December 31 measurement date for this plan. 

The components of net periodic benefit costs from these defined
benefit plans are as follows: 

In the first nine months of 2016, the Corporation funded postretirement
contributions totaling $44,000, with estimated annual postretirement contributions of $68,000 expected in 2016 for the full year.
Based upon the related actuarial reports, no defined benefit pension contributions are required in 2016, though the Corporation
may make discretionary contributions. 

10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS  

The Corporation has a Stock Incentive Plan for a selected group
of officers and an Independent Directors Stock Incentive Plan. In the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Corporation
issued restricted stock under each of the Plans. 

In the first quarter 2016, the Corporation awarded a total of 34,199
shares of restricted stock under the Stock Incentive and Independent Directors Stock Incentive Plans. Restricted stock awards
in the first quarter 2016 included the following: (1) a total of 17,289 shares to employees, vesting over a three-year term, with
vesting contingent upon the Corporation meeting an annual return on average equity ( ROAE ) performance ratio, as
defined; (2) a total of 10,304 shares to employees, vesting over a three-year term, with vesting dependent on satisfactory performance;
and (3) a total of 6,606 shares under the Independent Directors Incentive Plan, vesting over a term of one year. 

In the second quarter 2016, the Corporation awarded a total of
1,228 shares of restricted stock under the Independent Directors Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted stock was awarded to two
new directors, with each award vesting over a term of one year. 

In the first quarter 2015, a total of 34,800 shares of restricted
stock were awarded under the Plans. Restricted stock awards in 2015 included the following: (1) a total of 20,298 shares to employees,
vesting over a four-year term, with vesting contingent upon the Corporation meeting an annual ROAE performance ratio, as defined;
(2) a total of 2,198 shares to employees, vesting over a four-year term, with vesting dependent on satisfactory performance; (3)
an award to the Chief Executive Officer of 5,174 shares, vesting over a three-year term, with vesting dependent on satisfactory
performance; and (4) a total of 7,130 shares under the Independent Directors Incentive Plan, vesting over a term of one year. 

Compensation cost related to restricted stock is recognized based
on the market price of the stock at the grant date over the vesting period. Management has estimated restricted stock expense
in the first nine months of 2016 based on an assumption that the ROAE target for 2016 will be met. 

Total stock-based compensation expense is as follows: 

11. INCOME TAXES  

The net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 represents the following temporary difference components: 

The provision for income tax for the three-month and nine- month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is based on the Corporation s estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be
applicable for the full year. The effective tax rates for the Corporation are as follows: 

The effective tax rate for each period presented differs from the
statutory rate of 35% principally because of the effects of tax-exempt interest income. 

The Corporation has investments in three limited partnerships that
manage affordable housing projects that have qualified for the federal low-income housing tax credit. The Corporation s
expected return from these investments is based on the receipt of tax credits and tax benefits from deductions of operating losses.
The Corporation uses the effective yield method to account for these investments, with the benefits recognized as a reduction
of the provision for income taxes. For two of the three limited partnership investments, the tax credits have been received in
full in prior years, and the Corporation has fully realized the benefits of the credits and amortized its initial investments
in the partnerships. The most recent affordable housing project was completed in 2013, and the Corporation received tax credits
in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and expects to continue to receive tax credits annually through 2022. The carrying amount of the Corporation s
investment is $737,000 at September 30, 2016 and $812,000 at December 31, 2015 (included in Other Assets in the consolidated balance
sheets). For the year ending December 31, 2016, the estimated amount of tax credits and other tax benefits to be received is $158,000
and the estimated amount to be recognized as a reduction of the provision for income taxes is $76,000. For the year ended December
31, 2015, tax credits and other tax benefits totaled $158,000 and the amount recognized as a reduction of the provision for income
taxes for 2015 was $80,000. The total reduction in the provision for income taxes resulting from this investment is $19,000 in
the third quarter 2016, and $57,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $22,000 in the third quarter 2015, and $62,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Corporation has no unrecognized tax benefits, nor pending examination
issues related to tax positions taken in preparation of its income tax returns. With limited exceptions, the Corporation is no
longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for years prior to 2013. 

12. CONTINGENCIES  

In the normal course of business, the Corporation may be subject
to pending and threatened lawsuits in which claims for monetary damages could be asserted. In management s opinion, the
Corporation s financial position and results of operations would not be materially affected by the outcome of such pending
legal proceedings. 

13. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

The FASB issues Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) to the FASB
ASC. This section provides a summary description of recent ASUs that have significant implications (elected or required) within
the consolidated financial statements, or that management expects may have a significant impact on financial statements issued
in the near future. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, which provides a principles-based framework for revenue recognition that supersedes virtually all previously issued
revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the ASU requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements
better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The core principle of the five-step
revenue recognition framework is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which provides clarifying information related to identifying performance
obligations and licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which provides clarifying guidance in a few narrow areas
and adds some practical expedients to the guidance. In August 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date
of the revenue recognition standard by a year, making it applicable for the Corporation in the first quarter 2018 and for the
annual period ending December 31, 2018. The amendments should be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial
application. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of adopting the amendments, including determining
which transition method to apply. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Liabilities. This makes significant changes in U.S. GAAP related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The changes provided for in this Update that are applicable to the Corporation
are as follows: (1) require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that
result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; however,
an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment,
if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment
of the same issuer; (2) for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, require a qualitative assessment to identify
impairment, and if a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, requiring an entity to measure the investment at
fair value; (3) eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used
to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance
sheet; (4) require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments
for disclosure purposes; (5) require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change
in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to
measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments (at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Corporation has no liabilities for which the fair value measurement option has been elected); (6) require
separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that
is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (7) clarify
that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities
in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments in this Update will become effective for the
Corporation for annual and interim periods beginning in the first quarter 2018. With limited exceptions, early adoption of the
amendments in this Update is not permitted. Amendments are to be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance
sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable
fair values should be applied prospectively. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. Specifically,
a lessee should recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee would
be permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and liabilities.
Topic 842 would not significantly change the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from
a lease by a lessee from current U.S. GAAP; however, the principal change from current GAAP is that lease assets and liabilities
arising from operating leases would be recognized on the balance sheet. Topic 842 provides several other changes or clarifications
to existing GAAP, and will require qualitative disclosures, along with quantitative disclosures, so that financial statement users
can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. In transition, Topic 842 provides that lessees and
lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach, including optional practical expedients. An entity that elects to apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue
to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except
that lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting
date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP.
Topic 842 will become effective for the Corporation for annual and interim periods beginning in the first quarter 2019. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments  
Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This ASU eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for the equity method
as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of
operations and retained earnings retroactively as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods the investment
had been held. The ASU requires the equity method investor to add the cost of acquiring an additional interest in the investee
to the basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment
becomes qualified for the equity method. The ASU further requires that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security
that becomes qualified for the equity method recognize through earnings the unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive
income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in this Update are effective
for the Corporation for annual and interim periods beginning in the first quarter 2017, with earlier application permitted. The
amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation  
Stock Compensation. This ASU changes several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, and includes some changes
that apply only to nonpublic companies. This Update includes amendments that currently apply, or may apply in the future, to the
Corporation related to the following: (1) accounting for the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the amount
of compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of
cash flows; (3) accounting for forfeitures; (4) accounting for awards partially settled in cash in excess of the employer s
minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when
an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. The amendments in this Update are effective for the Corporation for
annual and interim periods beginning in the first quarter 2017, with earlier adoption permitted. The ASU provides separate transition
provisions for each of the amendments. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of adopting the amendments. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit
Losses (Topic 326). This ASU will result in significant changes in the Corporation s accounting for credit losses related
to loans receivable and investment securities. A summary of significant provisions of this ASU is as follows: 

The
                                         ASU requires that a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized
                                         cost basis be presented, net of a valuation allowance for credit losses, at an amount
                                         expected to be collected on the financial asset(s), and that the income statement include
                                         the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as changes
                                         in expected losses on previously recognized financial assets. The provisions of this
                                         ASU require measurement of expected credit losses based on relevant information including
                                         past events, historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportive
                                         forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. The provisions of this ASU differ
                                         from current U.S. GAAP in that current U.S. GAAP generally delays recognition of the
                                         full amount of credit losses until the loss is probable of occurring.    

The
                                         amendments in the Update retain many of the disclosure requirements related to credit
                                         quality in current U.S. GAAP, updated to reflect the change from an incurred loss methodology
                                         to an expected credit loss methodology. In addition, the Update requires that disclosure
                                         of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables,
                                         a current requirement, be further disaggregated by year of origination.    

This
                                         ASU requires that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as
                                         an allowance rather than as a write-down, and limits the amount of the allowance for
                                         credit losses to the amount by which the fair value is below amortized cost. For purchased
                                         available-for-sale securities with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration
                                         since origination, the ASU requires an allowance be determined in a manner similar to
                                         other available-for-sale debt securities; however, the initial allowance would be added
                                         to the purchase price, with only subsequent changes in the allowance recorded in credit
                                         loss expense, and interest income recognized at the effective rate excluding the discount
                                         embedded in the purchase price related to estimated credit losses at acquisition.    

This
                                         ASU will be effective for the Corporation for interim and annual periods beginning in
                                         the first quarter of 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter
                                         of 2019. The entity will record the effect of implementing this ASU through a cumulative-effect
                                         adjustment through retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which
                                         Topic 326 is effective. The Corporation is in the early stages of evaluating the potential
                                         impact of adopting this amendment.    

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230)  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This Update provides clarification regarding eight
specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments
are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. For the Corporation, the amendments in this Update are effective
beginning in the first quarter 2018. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retroactive transition method to
each period presented. The Corporation anticipates there will be no adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,
as previously reported, as a result of the clarifications provided in the Update. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Certain statements in this section and elsewhere in this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Citizens   Northern Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively,
the Corporation) intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements
contained in the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements, which are not historical facts, are based
on certain assumptions and describe future plans, business objectives and expectations, and are generally identifiable by the
use of words such as,  should ,  likely ,  expect ,  plan ,  anticipate ,
 target ,  forecast , and  goal . These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties that are difficult to predict, may be beyond management s control and could cause results to differ materially
from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors which could have a material, adverse impact on the
operations and future prospects of the Corporation include, but are not limited to, the following:

EARNINGS OVERVIEW  

Third quarter 2016 net income was $0.34 per basic and diluted share,
as compared to $0.32 in the second quarter 2016 and $0.35 in the third quarter 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
net income per basic and diluted share was $0.95 as compared to $1.02 per basic and $1.01 per diluted share for the first nine
months of 2015. The return on average assets for the first nine months of 2016 was 1.25%, and the return on average equity was
8.16%. 

Some of the more significant fluctuations in revenues and expenses
between the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and the corresponding period in 2015 were as follows: 

Noninterest
                                         expenses in the third quarter 2016 exceeded the third quarter 2015 amount by $462,000
                                         (5.7%). Salaries and wages expense increased $157,000 (4.2%), reflecting an increase
                                         in number of employees, including new positions established for lending, lending support,
                                         information technology, training, human resources and marketing functions. Professional
                                         fees expense increased $104,000 in the third quarter 2016 over the third quarter 2015
                                         amount, including increases related to employee sales and service training, information
                                         technology, marketing and outsourced commercial loan credit review. Other operating expense
                                         increased $164,000 (13.6%) in the third quarter 2016 over the third quarter 2015, including
                                         increases in education and training-related expense of $29,000, net collection-related
                                         expenses of $29,000 and expenses related to other real estate properties of $27,000.
                                         Also, other operating expense in the third quarter 2015 was reduced by a refund of $69,000
                                         from recovery of previously-paid sales tax, with no corresponding recovery in the third
                                         quarter 2016.    

The
                                         third quarter 2016 provision for income tax of $1,451,000, or 26.2% of pre-tax income,
                                         was $56,000 higher than the third quarter 2015 tax provision of $1,395,000, or 24.8%
                                         of pre-tax income. The higher effective tax in the third quarter 2016 included the effects
                                         of a reduction in tax-exempt interest income of $127,000. The reduction in tax-exempt
                                         interest income resulted from pay-offs received on municipal bonds purchased several
                                         years ago when market interest yields were higher. Also, the provision for state income
                                         tax was $39,000 higher, primarily as a result of a catch-up adjustment to increase New
                                         York State taxes for the effect of changes in the tax methodology that first became effective
                                         in 2015.    

Some of the more significant fluctuations in revenues and expenses
between the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and the corresponding period in 2015 were as follows: 

The
                                         provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1,224,000,
                                         an increase of $698,000 over the corresponding amount for the first nine months of 2015.
                                         In 2016, the provision included an increase of $418,000 as compared to the first nine
                                         months of 2015 from changes in specific allowances on loans individually identified as
                                         impaired, adjusted for the impact of net charge-offs. The provision in 2016 also included
                                         the impact of increasing the allowance for loan losses for the effects of loan growth
                                         and slight increases in net charge-off experience and qualitative factors used in determining
                                         the collectively evaluated portion of the allowance. In comparison, the provision in
                                         2015 also reflected the effects of loan growth, but the qualitative factors used in determining
                                         a portion of the collectively determined allowance for loan losses were slightly decreased
                                         during the period.    

Total
                                         noninterest revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was virtually unchanged
                                         from the corresponding amount for the first nine months of 2015. Within noninterest income,
                                         the categories with the largest increases included: (1) other operating income, which
                                         increased $157,000, mainly due to an increase in revenue from redemption of tax credits;
                                         (2) net gains from sales of loans, which increased $126,000 (22.0%), reflecting higher
                                         volume of sales; and (3) Trust and Financial Management revenue, which increased $89,000
                                         (2.6%). The categories with the largest decreases within noninterest revenue included:
                                         (1) decrease in fair value of mortgage servicing rights of $247,000 in the first nine
                                         months of 2016 as compared to a decrease in fair value of $137,000 in the first nine
                                         months of 2015; (2) decrease in service charges on deposit accounts of $106,000 (2.9%),
                                         reflecting a reduction in consumer overdraft volume; and (3) reduction in brokerage revenue
                                         of $71,000, as the volume of sales of annuities declined.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported
amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant
change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and
reasonable. Analytical information related to the Corporation s aggregate loans and the related allowance for loan losses
is summarized by loan segment and classes of loans in Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Additional discussion
of the Corporation s allowance for loan losses is provided in a separate section later in Management s Discussion
and Analysis. Given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses, it is likely that well-informed individuals
could make materially different assumptions, and could, therefore calculate a materially different allowance value. While management
uses available information to recognize losses on loans, changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years.
In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation s
allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their
judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination. 

Another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of
the Corporation s debt securities. For most of the Corporation s debt securities, the Corporation receives estimated
fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service, or from brokers. In developing fair values, the valuation
service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows, based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest
rate environments. Based on experience, management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers
and other valuation services. 

As described in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial
statements, management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). In making that evaluation, consideration
is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition
and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) whether the Corporation intends to sell the security or more likely than not will
be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. Management s assessments of the likelihood and potential
for recovery in value of securities are subjective and based on sensitive assumptions. 

NET INTEREST INCOME  

The Corporation s primary source of operating income is net
interest income, which is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense. Tables II, III
and IV include information regarding the Corporation s net interest income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. In each of these tables, the amounts of interest income earned on tax-exempt securities
and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, the net interest income amounts reflected in these
tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements. The discussion that follows is based on amounts
in the related Tables. 

Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

For the nine-month periods, fully taxable equivalent net interest
income was $32,297,000 in 2016, $125,000 (0.4%) higher than in 2015. Interest income was $617,000 lower in 2016 as compared to
2015; however, interest expense was lower by $742,000 in comparing the same periods. As presented in Table III, the Net Interest
Margin was 3.77% in 2016 as compared to 3.69% in 2015, and the  Interest Rate Spread  (excess of average rate of return
on earning assets over average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities) was 3.64% in 2016 as compared to 3.54% in 2015. 

INTEREST INCOME AND EARNING ASSETS 

Interest income totaled $35,070,000 in 2016, a decrease of 1.7%
from 2015. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased $1,320,000, or 5.2%. The average balance of gross loans receivable
increased $68,937,000, or 10.7%, to $715,575,000 in 2016 from $646,638,000 in 2015. The Corporation experienced significant growth
in both commercial and mortgage loans outstanding. Growth in commercial loans included an increase of approximately $23.3 million
in the average outstanding balance of participation loans in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months
of 2015. The Corporation s average rate of return on loans receivable declined to 4.94% in 2016 from 5.20% in 2015 as average
interest rates on new loans are lower, reflecting recent market conditions. 

As indicated in Table III, average available-for-sale securities
(at amortized cost) totaled $407,347,000 in 2016, a decrease of $87,574,000 (17.7%) from 2015. The net decrease in the Corporation s
available-for-sale securities portfolio consisted of decreases in all categories of securities with the exception of commercial
mortgage-backed securities. The Corporation s yield on securities was slightly lower in 2016 than in 2015, primarily because
of lower market interest rates. The average rate of return on available-for-sale securities was 2.78% in 2016 and 2.82% in 2015. 

INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES 

Interest expense fell $742,000, or 21.1%, to $2,773,000 in 2016
from $3,515,000 in 2015. Table III shows that the overall cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities fell to 0.45% in 2016
from 0.56% in 2015. 

Total average deposits (interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing)
decreased 1.0%, to $965,584,000 in 2016 from $974,873,000 in 2015. Decreases in the average balances of Individual Retirement
Accounts, certificates of deposit and demand deposits were partially offset by increases in savings, interest checking and money
market accounts. 

Total average borrowed funds decreased $13,273,000 to $64,476,000
in 2016 from $77,749,000 in 2015. The average rate on borrowed funds was 2.53% in 2016 compared to 3.55% in 2015, reflecting a
$29,684,000 reduction in the average balance of higher-rate, long-term borrowings resulting from prepayment in the second and
fourth quarters of 2015 of a long-term repurchase agreement borrowing with an interest rate of 4.265%. The average balance of
short-term borrowings increased $16,411,000 in 2016 over 2015, as average overnight borrowings were higher in 2016 and the Corporation
funded the pay-off of the long-term repurchase agreement with a series of short-term advances from the FHLB-Pittsburgh. 

Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

For the three-month periods, fully taxable equivalent net interest
income was $10,869,000 in 2016, which was $114,000 (1.1%) higher than in 2015. Interest income was $68,000 lower in 2016 as compared
to 2015, while interest expense was lower by $182,000 in comparing the same periods. As presented in Table III, the Net Interest
Margin was 3.74% in 2016 as compared to 3.66% in 2015, and the  Interest Rate Spread  (excess of average rate of return
on earning assets over average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities) was 3.61% in 2016 as compared to 3.51% in 2015. 

Interest income totaled $11,813,000 in 2016, a decrease of $68,000
(0.6%) from 2015. Interest and fees from loans receivable increased $476,000, or 5.6%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, while income
from available-for-sale securities decreased $553,000 (16.8%). As indicated in Table III, for the three-month periods, the average
balance of gross loans receivable increased 8.8% to $733,016,000 in 2016 from $673,735,000 in 2015. The average rate of return
on loans was 4.91% in 2016, down from 5.05% in 2015. Total average available-for-sale securities (at amortized cost) in 2016 decreased 

 to $404,526,000 from $473,216,000 in 2015. The average rate of
return on available-for-sale securities was 2.69% for 2016, down from 2.75% in 2015. 

For the three-month periods, interest expense fell $182,000, or
16.2%, to $944,000 in 2016 from $1,126,000 in 2015. Total average deposits (interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing) amounted
to $983,353,000 in the third quarter 2016, an increase of $6,036,000 (0.6%) from the third quarter 2015 total. Total average borrowed
funds decreased to $57,226,000 in the third quarter 2016 from $75,848,000 in the third quarter 2015, while the average rate on
borrowed funds fell to 2.75% in the third quarter 2016 from 3.34% in the third quarter 2015. The net change in average borrowed
funds included an increase of $5,683,000 in short-term borrowings and a decrease of $24,305,000 in long-term borrowings. In total,
the average interest rate on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.46% in the third quarter 2016 as compared to 0.53% in the third
quarter 2015. The reduction in average rate on interest-bearing liabilities in 2016 was mainly caused by the pay-off (prepayment)
of the higher-cost borrowing in 2015, as described above.

TABLE V - COMPARISON OF NONINTEREST INCOME  

  (In Thousands)  

Table V excludes realized gains on available-for-sale securities,
which are discussed in the  Earnings Overview  section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. Total noninterest
income shown in Table V was virtually unchanged in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015.
The most significant variances include the following: 

Other
                                         operating income increased $157,000, reflecting an increase of $91,000 in revenue from
                                         the redemption of tax credits. Also, other income associated with lending programs increased
                                         by a total of $59,000, including increases in fees associated with providing credit enhancement
                                         for the Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF) Original Program, providing access to certain
                                         U.S. Government programs and from the Corporation s participation in a title insurance
                                         entity on a co-operative basis with other banks.    

Net
                                         gains on the sale of loans increased $126,000 (22.0%). The Corporation originates and
                                         sells some of its residential mortgage production under the MPF Original and Xtra Programs,
                                         administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Pittsburgh. The 2016 increase
                                         in net gains from sales reflects the effects of a higher volume of residential mortgage
                                         sales, along with a higher margin on loans sold. For the first nine months of 2016, the
                                         amount of residential mortgage loans originated for the purpose of sale totaled $19.4
                                         million, an increase of 16.6% over the first nine months of 2015, and total cash proceeds
                                         from residential mortgage loans sold in the first nine months of 2016 amounted to $19.6
                                         million, an increase of 15.3% over the amount for the first nine months of 2015.    

Trust
                                         and Financial Management revenue increased $89,000 (2.6%), reflecting an increase in
                                         the balance of Trust assets under management. Trust assets under management amounted
                                         to $867,852,000 at September 30, 2016, an increase of 6.5% over the total at December
                                         31, 2015 and 9.8% over the corresponding total at September 30, 2015. Increases in Trust
                                         assets under management have resulted from an overall valuation increase in the U.S.
                                         stock market, along with growth from new business.    

The
                                         fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased $247,000 in the first nine months of
                                         2016, primarily from changes in prepayment assumptions driven by market expectations
                                         of lower interest rates. In comparison, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased
                                         $137,000 in the first nine months of 2015.    

Service
                                         charges on deposit accounts decreased $106,000 (2.9%), mainly as a result of a reduction
                                         in consumer overdraft volume.    

Brokerage
                                         revenue declined $71,000, as the volume of sales of annuities declined.    

TABLE VI - COMPARISON OF NONINTEREST INCOME  

  (In Thousands)  

Table VI excludes realized gains on available-for-sale securities,
which are discussed in the  Earnings Overview  section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. Total noninterest
income shown in Table VI decreased $77,000, or 1.9%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The most significant variances include the following: 

Service
                                         charges on deposit accounts decreased $81,000, or 6.2%, primarily as a result of a lower
                                         volume of consumer overdrafts.    

The
                                         fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased $68,000 in the third quarter 2016,
                                         primarily from changes in prepayment assumptions driven by market expectations of lower
                                         interest rates. In comparison, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights increased
                                         $13,000 in the third quarter 2015.    

Other
                                         operating income increased $58,000 in 2016, with increases in several categories, most
                                         significantly dividends received on Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh stock.    

Trust
                                         and financial management revenue increased $49,000 (4.4%) in the third quarter 2016 as
                                         compared to the third quarter 2015, reflecting growth in the amount of Trust assets under
                                         management and including an increase in revenue from retirement plan services of $16,000.    

TABLE VII - COMPARISON OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE  

  (In Thousands)  

As shown in Table VII, total noninterest expense increased $662,000
or 2.6% in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. Excluding the $910,000 loss on prepayment
of debt in 2015, total noninterest expense increased $1,572,000, or 6.4%. Other significant variances include the following: 

Salaries
                                         and wages expense increased $867,000 (8.0%), reflecting an increase in number of employees.
                                         The average number of full-time equivalent employees was 287 in 2016, up from 278 in
                                         2015, including new positions established for lending, lending support, information technology,
                                         training and marketing functions.    

Professional
                                         fees expense increased $379,000 (86.7%) in the first nine months 2016 over the first
                                         nine months of 2015 amount, including increases related to employee sales and service
                                         training, information technology, marketing and outsourced commercial loan credit review.    

Pensions
                                         and other employee benefits increased $163,000 (4.9%) in the first nine months of 2016
                                         over the first nine months of 2015 as a result of increased healthcare claims on the
                                         Corporation s partially self-insured plan as well as increases in other benefits
                                         attributable to having more personnel.    

Occupancy
                                         expense in the first nine months of 2016 was $215,000 (10.8%) lower than the total for
                                         the first nine months of 2015, primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense and
                                         lower winter-related expenses such as snow removal and fuel costs.     

TABLE VIII - COMPARISON OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE  

  (In Thousands)  

As shown in Table VIII, total noninterest expense increased $462,000,
or 5.7%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. Significant variances include the
following: 

Salaries
                                         and wages expense increased $157,000 (4.2%), reflecting an increase in number of employees.
                                         The average number of full-time equivalent employees was 288 in the third quarter 2016,
                                         up from 279 in the third quarter 2015, including new positions established for lending,
                                         lending support, information technology, training, human resources and marketing functions.    

Professional
                                         fees expense increased $104,000 (73.8%) in the three months ended September 30, 2016
                                         over the same period in 2015, including increases related to employee sales and service
                                         training, information technology, marketing and outsourced commercial loan credit review.    

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale)
were $742,338,000 at September 30, 2016, up 5.3% from $704,880,000 at December 31, 2015 and up 9.2% from $679,865,000 at September
30, 2015. The total outstanding balances of residential mortgage segment loans at September 30, 2016 increased $24,170,000 (6.3%)
as compared to December 31, 2015 and $29,345,000 (7.7%) as compared to September 30, 2015. The total outstanding balances of commercial
segment loans at September 30, 2016 increased $11,138,000 (3.6%) as compared to December 31, 2015 and $30,482,000 (10.6%) as compared
to September 30, 2015. 

The increases in loans outstanding in the latter half of 2015 and
first nine months of 2016 included increases in commercial participation loans. Participation loans represent portions of larger
commercial transactions for which other institutions are the  lead banks . Although not the lead bank, the Corporation
conducts detailed underwriting and monitoring of participation loan opportunities. Participation loans are included in the  Commercial
and industrial,   Commercial loans secured by real estate  and  Political subdivisions  classes
in the loan tables presented in this Form 10-Q. Total participation loans outstanding amounted to $48,670,000 at September 30,
2016, up from $44,456,000 at December 31, 2015 and $32,332,000 at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the balance of participation
loans outstanding includes a total of $34,564,000 to businesses located outside of the Corporation s market area, including
$11,996,000 from participations in loans originated through the Corporation s membership in a network that originates loans
throughout the U.S. The Corporation s participation loans originated through the network consist of loans to businesses
that are larger than the Corporation s typical commercial customer base. The loans originated through the network are considered
 leveraged loans,  meaning the businesses typically have minimal tangible book equity and the extent of collateral
available is limited, though the businesses have demonstrated strong cash flow performance in their recent histories. At September
30, 2016, total leveraged participation loans, including loans originated through the network and a loan originated through another
lead institution, totaled $14,688,000. 

Other significant changes in the average balances of the Corporation s
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are described in the  Net Interest Income  section of Management s
Discussion and Analysis. Other significant balance sheet items, including the allowance for loan losses and stockholders 
equity, are discussed in separate sections of Management s Discussion and Analysis. 

Management does not expect capital expenditures to have a material,
detrimental effect on the Corporation s financial condition in 2016. 

Since 2009, the Corporation has originated and sold residential
mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Xtra program administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh
and Chicago. Residential mortgages originated and sold through the MPF Xtra program consist primarily of conforming, prime loans
sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), a government agency. In 2014, the Corporation began to originate
and sell residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Original program, which is also administered by the
Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Chicago. Residential mortgages originated and sold through the MPF Original program
consist primarily of conforming, prime loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. For loans sold under the Original
program, the Corporation provides a credit enhancement whereby the Corporation would assume credit losses in excess of a defined
First Loss Account ( FLA ) balance, up to specified amounts. The FLA is funded by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh
based on a percentage of the outstanding balance of loans sold. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation has recorded an allowance
in the amount of $169,000 for credit losses on loans sold under the MPF Original Program which is included in  Accrued interest
and other liabilities  in the accompanying balance sheet. There was no allowance recorded at December 31, 2015. The Corporation
does not provide a credit enhancement for loans sold through the Xtra program. 

For loan sales originated under the MPF Xtra and Original programs,
the Corporation provides customary representations and warranties to investors that specify, among other things, that the loans
have been underwritten to the standards established by the investor. The Corporation may be required to repurchase a loan and
reimburse a portion of fees received, or reimburse the investor for a credit loss incurred on a loan, if it is determined that
the representations and warranties have not been met. Such repurchases or reimbursements generally result from an underwriting
or documentation deficiency. At September 30, 2016, the total outstanding balance of loans the Corporation has repurchased as
a result of identified instances of noncompliance amounted to $1,866,000, and the corresponding total outstanding balance repurchased
at December 31, 2015 was $1,968,000. 

At September 30, 2016, outstanding balances of loans sold and serviced
through the two programs totaled $157,845,000, including loans sold through the MPF Xtra program of $117,738,000 and loans sold
through the Original program of $40,107,000. At December 31, 2015, outstanding balances of loans sold and serviced through the
two programs totaled $152,448,000, including loans sold through the MPF Xtra program of $125,571,000 and loans sold through the
Original Program of $26,877,000. Based on the fairly limited volume of required repurchases to date, no allowance had been established
for representation and warranty exposures as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 

The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses that represents
management s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction
of the investment in loans. Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements provides an overview of the process management
uses for evaluating and determining the allowance for loan losses. 

While management uses available information to recognize losses
on loans, changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years. In addition, various regulatory agencies,
as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation s allowance for loan losses. Such
agencies may require the Corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available
to them at the time of their examination. 

The allowance for loan losses was $8,421,000 at September 30, 2016,
up from $7,889,000 at December 31, 2015. Table X shows the collectively determined component of the allowance for residential
mortgages was $382,000 higher at September 30, 2016 than at December 31, 2015, reflecting growth in outstanding loans and the
use of slightly higher qualitative factors to estimate the required allowance. Also, the collectively determined component of
the allowance for commercial loans was $291,000 higher at September 30, 2016 than at December 31, 2015, reflecting the effects
of growth in outstanding loans and increases in the average net charge-offs experience and qualitative factors used to estimate
the required allowance. 

The provision (credit) for loan losses by segment in the three-month
and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

As shown in the table above, the provision for loan losses for
the third quarter 2016 exceeded the third quarter 2015 amount by $236,000, with the largest increases in the residential mortgage
and commercial segments. In the third quarter 2016, the provision related to residential mortgage loans included an increase of
$142,000 in the qualitative factors component of the collectively determined allowance. In comparison, the net credit related
to the residential mortgage segment in the third quarter 2015 included an increase related to qualitative factors of $55,000,
but also included a credit of $78,000 related to the change in total specific allowances on impaired loans, as adjusted for net
charge-offs during the period. For the commercial segment, the third quarter 2016 provision included $433,000 from the increase
in total specific allowances on impaired loans, as adjusted for net charge-offs, and $26,000 from an increase in the allowance
related to qualitative factors, reduced $122,000 by improvement in the net charge-offs experience component of the collectively
determined allowance. In comparison, the main components of the commercial provision in the third quarter 2015 included an increase
in the collectively determined portion of the allowance based on qualitative factors of $141,000 and a net increase in specific
allowances on impaired loans of $108,000. 

The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 totaled $1,224,000, an increase of $698,000 over the corresponding amount for the first nine months of 2015. In the first
nine months of 2016, the provision related to the residential mortgage segment increased $400,000, and the provision related to
the commercial segment increased $307,000. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the provision related to residential
mortgage loans included an increase of $70,000 related to the change in total specific allowances on impaired loans, as adjusted
for net charge-offs during the period, while the net provision for the first nine months of 2015 included a credit of $164,000
attributable to a net reduction in specific allowances on impaired residential mortgage loans. Also, the provision related to
residential mortgage loans in the first nine months of 2016 included an increase of $367,000 in the qualitative factors component
of the allowance as compared to an increase of $127,000 in the qualitative factors component in the first nine months of 2015.
For the commercial segment, the provision for the first nine months of 2016 included $459,000 from the increase in total specific
allowances on impaired loans, as compared to a net increase of $282,000 in specific allowances on impaired loans in the first
nine months of 2015. Also, the provision related to the commercial segment for the first nine months of 2016 included $194,000
from an increase in the qualitative factors component of the collectively determined portion of the allowance as compared to a
corresponding $80,000 increase in the first nine months of 2015. 

Table XI presents information related to past due and impaired
loans, and loans that have been modified under terms that are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Total nonperforming
loans as a percentage of outstanding loans was 2.70% at September 30, 2016, up from 2.09% at December 31, 2015, and nonperforming
assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.79% at September 30, 2016, up from 1.31% at December 31, 2015. Table XI presents
data at September 30, 2016 and at the end of each of the years ended December 31, 2011 through 2015. For the range of dates presented
in Table XI, total nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans has ranged from a low of 1.19% at December 31, 2011 to a high
of 2.80% at December 31, 2013, and total nonperforming assets as a percentage of assets has ranged from a low of 0.73% at December
31, 2011 to a high of 1.79% at September 30, 2016. 

Total impaired loans of $11,135,000 at September 30, 2016, are
up $1,161,000 from the corresponding amount at December 31, 2015 of $9,974,000, including an increase in impaired loans with a
valuation allowance of $1,688,000. In the third quarter 2016, the Corporation recorded an allowance of $528,000 related to one
real estate secured commercial loan relationship with total loans outstanding of $3,347,000, including one loan with an outstanding
balance of $2,695,000 that was classified as impaired with a valuation allowance at September 30, 2016. 

Total nonperforming assets of $22,341,000 at September 30, 2016
are up $6,335,000 from the corresponding amount at December 31, 2015, including increases in nonaccrual loans, loans past due
90 days or more and still accruing interest and foreclosed (real estate) assets held for sale, summarized as follows: 

The outstanding balances of impaired loans without a valuation
allowance, nonaccrual loans and nonperforming TDRs at September 30, 2016, include an outstanding balance of $4,836,000 from loans
to one commercial entity. In 2014, the Corporation entered into a forbearance agreement with this commercial borrower which included
a reduction in monthly payment amounts over a fifteen-month period. At the end of the fifteen-month period, the monthly payment
amounts would revert to the original amounts, unless the forbearance agreement was extended or the payment requirements otherwise
modified. The forbearance agreement has been extended for two additional twelve-month periods, most recently in July 2016. The
Corporation recorded a charge-off of $1,486,000 in the second quarter 2014 as a result of these modifications, as the payment
amounts based on the forbearance agreement are not sufficient to fully amortize the contractual amount of principal outstanding
on the loans. The borrower has made all required payments on the loans in accordance with the terms of the forbearance agreement,
as extended. 

Each period presented in Table XI includes a few large commercial
relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts. As a result, a limited number of relationships may
significantly impact the total amount of allowance required on impaired loans, and may significantly impact the amount of total
charge-offs reported in any one period. 

Management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning
identification of impaired loans, estimates of loss, and nonaccrual status; however, the actual losses realized from these relationships
could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of September 30, 2016. Management continues to closely monitor its commercial
loan relationships for possible credit losses, and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status,
if appropriate.

LIQUIDITY  

Liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable
cost. An adequate liquidity position permits the Corporation to pay creditors, compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations
and fund unexpected loan demand. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation maintained overnight interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and other correspondent banks totaling $9,620,000. 

The Corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several
correspondent banks that provide a source of day-to-day liquidity. Also, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, secured by various mortgage loans. 

The Corporation has a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia s Discount Window. Management intends to use this line of credit as a contingency funding source. As collateral
for the line, the Corporation has pledged available-for-sale securities with a carrying value of $18,899,000 at September 30,
2016. 

The Corporation s outstanding, available, and total credit
facilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, the Corporation s outstanding credit
facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh consisted of overnight borrowings of $2,000,000, short-term borrowings
of $6,270,000, and long-term borrowings with a total amount of $11,538,000. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation s outstanding
credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh consisted of overnight borrowings of $23,500,000, short-term borrowings
of $25,081,000, and long-term borrowings with a total amount of $11,767,000. Additional information regarding borrowed funds is
included in Note 8 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

Additionally, the Corporation uses repurchase agreements placed
with brokers to borrow funds secured by investment assets and  RepoSweep  arrangements to borrow funds from commercial
banking customers on an overnight basis. If required to raise cash in an emergency situation, the Corporation could sell available-for-sale
securities to meet its obligations. At September 30, 2016, the carrying value of available-for-sale securities in excess of amounts
required to meet pledging or repurchase agreement obligations was $193,452,000. 

Management believes the Corporation is well-positioned to meet
its short-term and long-term obligations. 

STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY  

The Corporation and C N Bank are subject to various regulatory
capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Details concerning capital ratios at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 are presented below. Management believes, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that the Corporation
and C N Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and maintain capital conservation buffers (described
in more detail in the  New Capital Rule  section below) that allow the Corporation and C N Bank to avoid limitations
on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. Further,
as reflected in the table below, the Corporation s and C N Bank s capital ratios at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 exceed the Corporation s policy threshold levels. 

Management expects the Corporation and C N Bank to maintain
capital levels that exceed the regulatory standards for well-capitalized institutions and the applicable capital conservation
buffers for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Future dividend payments will depend upon maintenance of a strong
financial condition, future earnings and capital and regulatory requirements. As described in more detail in the section below
titled  New Capital Rule,  the Corporation and C N Bank are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends
that may be paid without approval of banking regulatory authorities. 

NEW CAPITAL RULE 

In July 2013, the federal regulatory authorities issued a new capital
rule based, in part, on revisions developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the Basel capital framework (Basel
III). The Corporation and C N Bank became subject to the new rule effective January 1, 2015. Generally, the new rule implemented
higher minimum capital requirements, revised the definition of regulatory capital components and related calculations, added a
new common equity tier 1 capital ratio, implemented a new capital conservation buffer, increased the risk weighting for past due
loans and provided a transition period for several aspects of the new rule. 

The current (new) capital rule provides that, in order to avoid
limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers,
a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based
capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements
began January 1, 2016. The transition schedule for new ratios, including the capital conservation buffer, is as follows: 

As fully phased in, a banking organization with a buffer greater
than 2.5% would not be subject to additional limits on dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization
with a buffer less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The new rule
also prohibits a banking organization from making dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments if its eligible retained income
is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% as of the beginning of that quarter.
Eligible net income is defined as net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any
distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. A summary of payout restrictions based on the capital
conservation buffer is as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, the Corporation s Capital Conservation
Buffer, determined based on the minimum total capital ratio, was 15.56%. C N Bank s Capital Conservation Buffer (also
determined based on the minimum total capital ratio) was 13.04%. 

The Corporation s total stockholders  equity is affected
by fluctuations in the fair values of available-for-sale securities. The difference between amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale
securities, net of deferred income tax, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income within stockholders  equity.
The balance in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred
income tax, amounted to $5,388,000 at September 30, 2016 and $2,493,000 at December 31, 2015. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive
income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders  equity. If available-for-sale securities 

 are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, unrealized losses
are recorded as a charge against earnings, and amortized cost for the affected securities is reduced. Note 6 to the unaudited
consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning management s evaluation of available-for-sale
securities for other-than-temporary impairment at September 30, 2016. 

Stockholders  equity is also affected by the underfunded
or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. The balance in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
related to defined benefit plans, net of deferred income tax, was $42,000 at September 30, 2016 and $35,000 at December 31, 2015. 

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  

Comprehensive Income is the total of (1) net income, and (2) all
other changes in equity from non-stockholder sources, which are referred to as Other Comprehensive Income. Changes in the components
of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) are included in Other Comprehensive Income, and for the Corporation, consist
of changes in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and changes in underfunded or overfunded defined benefit
plans. Fluctuations in interest rates significantly affect fair values of available-for-sale securities, and accordingly have
an effect on Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in each period. 

Comprehensive Income totaled $2,623,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to $6,270,000 in the third quarter 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Comprehensive
Income included: (1) Net Income of $4,087,000, which was $147,000 lower than in the third quarter 2015; (2) Other Comprehensive
Loss from a decrease in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities of ($1,461,000) as compared to Other Comprehensive
Income of $2,039,000 from an increase in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities in the third quarter 2015; and
(3) Other Comprehensive Loss from defined benefit plans of ($3,000) for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. 

Comprehensive Income totaled $14,433,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to $13,168,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In the nine months ended September
30, 2016, Comprehensive Income included: (1) Net Income of $11,531,000, which was $875,000 lower than in the first nine months
of 2015; (2) Other Comprehensive Income from an increase in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities of $2,895,000
as compared to Other Comprehensive Income of $835,000 in the first nine months of 2015; and (3) Other Comprehensive Income from
defined benefit plans of $7,000 as compared to Other Comprehensive Loss of ($73,000) in the first nine months of 2015. 

INCOME TAXES  

The provision for income tax for interim periods is based on the
Corporation s estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. The Corporation s effective
tax rates differ from the statutory rate of 35% principally because of the effects of tax-exempt interest income. 

The third quarter 2016 provision for income tax of $1,451,000,
or 26.20% of pre-tax income, was $56,000 higher than the third quarter 2015 tax provision of $1,395,000, or 24.78% of pre-tax
income. The higher effective tax in the third quarter 2016 included the effects of a reduction in tax-exempt interest income of
$127,000. The reduction in tax-exempt interest income resulted from pay-offs received on municipal bonds purchased several years
ago when market interest yields were higher. Also, the provision for state income tax was $39,000 higher, primarily as a result
of a catch-up adjustment to increase New York State taxes for the effect of changes in the tax methodology that first became effective
in 2015. 

The provision for income tax totaled $3,847,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, down $229,000 from the amount for the first nine months of 2015. The lower tax provision in 2016 resulted
from lower pre-tax income; however, the provision increased as a percentage of pre-tax income to 25.02% in 2016 from 24.73% in
2015. The higher effective tax rate included the impact of a $253,000 reduction in tax-exempt interest income and an increase
in the provision for state income tax of $30,000 that resulted mainly from a catch-up adjustment to increase the state tax provision
for New York State. 

The Corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities
based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. At September
30, 2016, the net deferred tax asset was $1,544,000, down from $3,115,000 at December 31, 2015. The most significant change in
temporary difference components was an increase of $1,560,000 in the deferred tax liability associated with unrealized gains on
available-for-sale securities. 

The Corporation regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability
based on history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization
of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income, including taxable income in prior carryback
years, as well as future taxable income. Management believes the recorded net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016 is fully
realizable; however, if management determines the Corporation will be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset,
the Corporation would adjust the deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact earnings. 

Additional information related to income taxes is presented in
Note 11 to the unaudited, consolidated financial statements. 

INFLATION  

The Corporation is significantly affected by the Federal Reserve
Board s efforts to control inflation through changes in short-term interest rates. Beginning in September 2007, in response
to concerns about weakness in the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve lowered the fed funds target rate numerous times; in December
2008, it established a target range of 0% to 0.25%, which it maintained through mid-December 2015. On December 16, 2015, the Federal
Reserve raised their target for the federal funds rate to 0.25% to 0.50%. This decision was based on data available that suggested
economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace. This included an increase in household spending, business fixed investments
increasing, and an improvement in labor market conditions. Also, throughout this period, the Federal Reserve has injected massive
amounts of liquidity into the nation s monetary system through a variety of programs. The Federal Reserve has purchased
large amounts of securities in an effort to keep interest rates low and stimulate economic growth. Beginning in late 2013, the
Federal Reserve began reducing the amount of securities purchased under its asset purchase program and then ended the program
in October 2014, though still reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities
in agency mortgage-backed securities and continued to roll over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Federal Reserve maintained
their commitment to this policy in their September 21, 2016 statement and anticipates doing so until normalization of the level
of the federal funds rate is well under way. 

Despite the current low short-term rate environment, inflation
statistics indicate that the overall rate of inflation is unlikely to significantly affect the Corporation s operations
within the near future. Although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation, management monitors the impact
of economic trends, including any indicators of inflationary pressures, in managing interest rate and other financial risks. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK   

MARKET RISK  

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
market rates and prices of the Corporation s financial instruments. In addition to the effects of interest rates, the market
prices of the Corporation s debt securities within the available-for-sale securities portfolio are affected by fluctuations
in the risk premiums (amounts of spread over risk-free rates) demanded by investors. Management attempts to limit the risk that
economic conditions would force the Corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position
(discussed in the  Stockholders  Equity and Capital Adequacy  section of Management s Discussion and Analysis)
and ample sources of liquidity (discussed in the  Liquidity  section of Management s Discussion and Analysis). 

The Corporation s two major categories of market risk are
interest rate risk and equity securities risk, which are discussed in the following sections. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  

Business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent
factor in operating a bank. The Corporation s assets are predominantly long-term, fixed-rate loans and debt securities.
Funding for these assets comes principally from shorter-term deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, there is an inherent risk
of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the Corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change. 

The Corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential
effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity. For purposes of these calculations,
the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments, such as securities, loans, deposits and
borrowed funds, and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses.
The model measures and projects the amount of potential changes in net interest income, and calculates the discounted present
value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments, assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. Management
ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus 100-400 basis points of current rates. 

The model makes estimates, at each level of interest rate change,
regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities and call activity on other investment securities.
Actual results could vary significantly from these estimates, which could result in significant differences in the calculations
of projected changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity. Also, the model does not make estimates related
to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition, and the table does not necessarily
reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. 

The Corporation s Board of Directors has established policy
guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk, based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. The policy
limits acceptable fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline (flat rates) one-year scenario and variances in the market
value of portfolio equity from the baseline values based on current rates. 

Table XIII, which follows this discussion, is based on the results
of calculations performed using the simulation model as of July 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The table shows that as of the
respective dates, the changes in net interest income and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios. 

TABLE XIII - THE EFFECT OF HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST
RATES  

EQUITY SECURITIES RISK  

The Corporation s equity securities portfolio consists of
investments in stocks of banks and bank holding companies. Investments in bank stocks are subject to risk factors that affect
the banking industry in general, including credit risk, competition from non-bank entities, interest rate risk and other factors,
which could result in a decline in market prices. Also, losses could occur in individual stocks held by the Corporation because
of specific circumstances related to each bank. 

Equity securities held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 are presented in Table XIV. Table XIV presents quantitative data concerning the effects of a decline in fair value of the
Corporation s equity securities of 10% or 20%. The data in Table XIV does not reflect the effects of any appreciation in
value that may occur, nor does it present the Corporation s maximum exposure to loss on equity securities, which would be
100% of their fair value as of September 30, 2016. 

TABLE XIV - EQUITY SECURITIES RISK  

  (In Thousands)  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

The Corporation s management, under the supervision of and
with the participation of the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has carried out an evaluation
of the design and effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Corporation s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed in reports the
Corporation files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

There were no significant changes in the Corporation s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that
are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 

The Corporation and C N Bank are involved in various
legal proceedings incidental to their business. Management believes the aggregate liability, if any, resulting from such pending
and threatened legal proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition or results
of operations. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes from the risk factors
previously disclosed in Item 1A of the Corporation s Form 10-K filed February 18, 2016. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

The following table sets forth a summary of the purchases
by the Corporation, on the open market, of its equity securities during the third quarter 2016: 

Note to Table: Effective April 21, 2016, the Corporation s
Board of Directors approved a new treasury stock repurchase program. Under the newly approved stock repurchase program, the Corporation
is authorized to repurchase up to 600,000 shares of the Corporation's common stock or slightly less than 5% of the Corporation's
issued and outstanding shares at April 19, 2016. The Board of Directors  April 21, 2016 authorization provides that: (1)
the new treasury stock repurchase program shall be effective when publicly announced and shall continue thereafter until suspended
or terminated by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion; and (2) all shares of common stock repurchased pursuant to the
new program shall be held as treasury shares and be available for use and reissuance for purposes as and when determined by the
Board of Directors including, without limitation, pursuant to the Corporation s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan and its equity compensation program. To date, no purchases have been made under this repurchase program.

                                         as of, and for, the periods presented in this quarterly report;   

4. The registrant s other

15d-15(f)) for the registrant and we have: 

a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                                         such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
                                         that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
                                         is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
                                         which this report is being prepared;   

b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
                                         caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
                                         to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
                                         the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
                                         accepted accounting principles;   

c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure
                                         controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
                                         of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
                                         report based on such evaluation; and   

d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s
                                         internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
                                         most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case
                                         of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
                                         affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and   

5. The registrant s other
certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
function): 

a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                                         design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
                                         likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize
                                         and report financial information; and   

b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                                         or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting.
