     Table of Contents          Plush Corporation    Notes to the Financial Statements    (Unaudited)       NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING      Plush Corporation was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 20, 2015 and it is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company is a development stage company that intends to design, market, and sell luxury accessories for men online through its website. To date, the company s activities have been limited to raising capital, organizational matters, launching the website and the structuring of its business plan. The company has not generated any revenues since inception.     The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the company s management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the company as September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the company s Registration statement on Form S-1 for the period ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016.      Going Concern      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the company had a net loss of $35,171. As of September 30, 2016 the company has not generated any revenues from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the company s ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern.                 7       
     Table of Contents           NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.      Development Stage Company      The company is considered to be in the development stage as defined in ASC 915   Development Stage Entities.   The company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to the development of its business plans. The company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements; and does not present or disclose inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915.      Use of estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Start-Up Costs      In accordance with ASC 720,   Start-up Costs ,  the company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the company.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including our own credit risk.                 8       
     Table of Contents         In addition to defining fair value, the standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:     Level 1   inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.     Level 2   inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.     Level 3   inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.     The company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.      Concentrations of Credit Risks      The company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. The company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The company s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.      Income Taxes      The company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of September 30, 2016 the company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.                  9       
     Table of Contents          Loss per Share Calculations      Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the period ended September 30, 2016, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect.      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements      Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.      NOTE 3   NOTE PAYABLE      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 loan payable, related party was nil and $1,111 related to various payments made to vendors for services, by an officer of the Company. This amount is non-interest bearing and due on demand.      NOTE 4   SHARE CAPITAL       Authorized Stock      The company has authorized 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought.      Common Share Issuances      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued a total of 3,000,000 common shares for $3,000 cash.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 a stockholder of the company contributed $40,562 to the Company as a capital contribution.             NOTE 5   INCOME TAX      The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, "Income Taxes." Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. The Company provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset.     The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons:            Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of:            NOTE 6   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued. Based on our evaluation no additional events have occurred that require disclosure.             Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS     This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.

In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to  common shares  refer to the common shares in our capital stock.     As used in this quarterly report, the terms  we ,  us ,  our  and  our company  mean Plush Corporation, unless otherwise indicated.        General Overview      We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 20, 2015. Our business is to design, market and sell luxury accessories for men online on our website at www.myplushonline.com. We are in the development stage, and have not realized any revenues from our operations.      We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings.      Our principal office address is located at 5348 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89108. Our telephone number is (702) 831-6550.      Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue.     We do not have any subsidiaries.            Results of Operations      We have not earned any revenues from our inception on October 20, 2015 through September 30, 2016.      Three and Nine months ended September 30, 2016.            Operating expenses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 consisted of general and administrative expenses.      Liquidity and Capital Resources        The following table provides selected financial data about our company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.      Working Capital                    Cash Flows            We had cash and cash equivalents of $Nil as of September 30, 2016 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $3,605 as of December 31, 2015. We had working capital of $4,139 as of September 30, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $1,006 as of December 31, 2015.     The report of our auditors on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, contains a going concern qualification as we have suffered losses since our inception. We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.      Plan of Operation and Funding      We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.     Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavours or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our officers directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our officers and directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.             Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.      Critical Accounting Policies        Use of estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures      As of September 30, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.  The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.     Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.     C hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is: (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us.         Item 1A. Risk Factors       As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 2.
