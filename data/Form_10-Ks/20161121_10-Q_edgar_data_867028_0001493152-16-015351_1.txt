1.
BUSINESS   

2050
Motors, Inc., (the  Company ) was formed to import, market, and sell electric cars manufactured in China. 2050 Motors
has entered into an agreement with Jiangsu Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd., located in Jiangsu, China ( Aoxin ),
for the distribution in the United States of a new electric automobile, known as the e-Go EV.  

2.
GOING CONCERN   

The
Company s ability to continue in existence is dependent on its ability to develop additional sources of capital, and/or
achieve profitable operations, positive cash flows, and the successful distribution of the vehicles in the USA markets. Management s
plan is to aggressively pursue its present business plan. Since inception the Company has funded its operations through the issuance
of common stock and related party funding and advances, and will seek additional debt or equity financing as required. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company would be successful in raising such additional funds. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Unaudited
Interim Financial Information    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the SEC s requirements for Form
10-Q and, in the opinion of management, contain all adjustments, of a normal and recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair
statement of (i) the condensed balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015; (ii) the condensed statements of operations
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015; and (iii) the condensed statements of cash flows for the
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. However, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not
include all information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
GAAP ). The Condensed balance sheet, included in this report, as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the 2015 audited
financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  

These
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on April
6, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Cash    

Cash
consists of deposits in one large national bank.  

Advertising
Costs    

Costs
incurred for producing and communicating advertising are expensed when incurred and included in selling general and administrative
expenses. Advertising expense amounted to $0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are charged to the asset accounts while replacements, maintenance
and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed. At the time property and equipment
are retired or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts.
Gains or losses from retirements or sales are credited or charged to income. Property and equipment are depreciated over the useful
lives of the asset using the straight line method.  

Depreciation
is calculated using straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives as follows:  

Furniture
    and fixtures Leasehold   
      7
    years   
 
      improvements
    Vehicles and parts  
      Lessor
    of lease term or life of related assets   
 
      Tools
    and equipment  
      3
    years   

5
    years   

Depreciation
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 totaled $9,785 and $29,585, respectively. Depreciation for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 totaled $4,735 and  

  $14,050,
respectively.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Assets    

The
Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded. No impairment losses were recognized for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Earnings
Per Share    

Basic
earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding
common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and
2015, the Company has incurred losses; therefore the effect of any Common Stock equivalent would be anti- dilutive during those
periods. There were no warrants, options, or other stock equity outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk    

Cash
is mainly maintained by one highly qualified institution in the United States. At various times such amounts are in excess of
federally insured limits. Management does not believe that the Company is subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal
risk associated with commercial banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncement    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes
the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue
recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendments create a new Subtopic 340-40,
 Other Assets and Deferred Costs Contracts with Customers . In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that
an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For a public entity, the amendments
in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have
on Company s financial position and statement of operations.  

In
June 2014, FASB issued amendment 2014-10 that eliminates certain financial reporting requirements for Development Stage Entities.
This amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods therein. Early
application is permitted. The Company adopted this amendment effective July 1, 2014 by removing the following disclosures:

a)
Presentation of inception-to-date information in the statement of income, cash flows and shareholder equity.  

b)
Labeling the financial statements as those of a development stage entity.  

c)
Description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged.  

In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern  , Subtopic 205-40,   Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities
and require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon
certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the
term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for
considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated
as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial
doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are
issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15,
2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating
the impact this guidance will have on Company s financial position and results of operations.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. This statement requires an asset and liability approach
for accounting for income taxes. The accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America provides accounting
and disclosure guidance about positions taken by an entity in its tax returns that might be uncertain.  

The
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America provides accounting and disclosure guidance about positions
taken by an organization in its tax returns that might be uncertain. Management has considered its tax positions and believes
that all of the positions taken by the Company in its Federal and State tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examinations
by U.S. Federal and State tax authorities from 2012 (inception) to the present, generally for three years after they are filed.  

Foreign
Currency Risk    

Any
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have significant impact on Company s future financial statements
upon fulfilling certain purchase commitments in accordance to the license agreement disclosed in Note 5.

In
2012 and 2013, the Company made a total payment of $50,000 and signed an exclusive license agreement with Aoxin to import, assemble
and manufacture the advanced carbon fiber electric vehicle, the e-Go EV model. The cost of this license agreement has been recognized
as a long-term asset and is evaluated, by management, for impairment losses at each reporting period.  

6.
SHORT-TERM ADVANCES   

On
August 29, 2014 and September 30, 2014, the Company issued two loans for a total amount of $100,000 due to a shareholder. The

Company received a $10,000 loan during the third quarter of 2016 from an unrelated party. The loan bears 12% interest and matures
on March 16, 2017.  

During the third quarter ended September 30,
2016, the Company received a cash advance of $3,410 from one of its executives. The cash advance is non-interest bearing and is

7.
PROMISSORY NOTE AND EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT   

On
June 24, 2016, the Company issued a $75,000 non-refundable Promissory Note to an investor as a pre- condition to an Equity Purchase
Agreement. The promissory note bears 10% interest per annum with a one year maturity date. The note is recognized as a deferred
finance charge and is being amortized over the contract period.  

The
Equity Purchase Agreement allows the Company to issue Put Notices and the right to sell up to $10,000,000 of its no par value
common stock at 88% of its market value. The market value is based on a ten day valuation period immediately preceding the Put
Notice. The right to sell the shares becomes an obligation to sell as of the closing date after the Put Notice has been issued
to the investor. The investor at no time can own more than 9.99% of the Company s common stock outstanding as of the closing
date.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation   

Plan
of Operations   

This
10 Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of
general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth
below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis
for projections of future events.   

Plan
of Operation   

Prior
to the completion of the acquisition of 2050 Motors, Inc., a Nevada corporation, ( 2050 Motors ) on May 2, 2014, the
Company was a public  shell  company with nominal assets whose sole business was to identify, evaluate, and investigate
various companies to acquire or with which to merge. Upon consummation of the transaction with 2050 Motors, the Company s
business became the business of 2050 Motors, which is the Company s sole operating subsidiary. Our principal business objective
for the next 12 months will be to achieve long-term growth through 2050 Motors.  

The
Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of 2050 Motors on May 2, 2014. The acquisition
was effected pursuant to the terms of a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization (the  Agreement ) entered into on February
5, 2014, by and between the Company, 2050 Motors and Certain Shareholders of 2050 Motors. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,
the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of 2050 Motors in exchange for 24,994,670 post-split shares
of the Company s common stock (aggregating approximately 82% of its issued and outstanding common stock).  

2050 Motors principal activity is the importation
and the marketing and selling of electric automobiles. 2050 Motors, Inc. has an exclusive license, subject to minimum sales requirements,
to import, market and sell in the United States, Puerto Rico, the US Territories and Peru, the  e-Go  lightweight
carbon fiber all electric vehicle design and electric light truck, manufactured by Jiangsu Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., LTD
( Aoxin Automobile ) located in the Peoples Republic of China ( PRC ). Aoxin Automobile is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Dongfeng Motors Corporation ( Dongfeng Motor ) which is one of the largest automobile manufacturers
in China, producing over 3.76 million cars and trucks in 2012. Aoxin Automobile was funded by Dongfeng Motors to develop and manufacture
a lightweight, super-efficient, carbon fiber e-Go EV electric car ( e-Go EV ). Dongfeng Motor, over a five year period,
invested a substantial amount of money to develop with the support of Italian engineers a new carbon fiber technology to produce
carbon fiber parts at a significantly reduced cost. They also developed a lightweight aluminum racing frame to ultimately create
the ultra-lightweight electric automobile known as the e-Go. In 2014, Yancheng Municipal State-Owned Asset Investment Group, Co.
Ltd. (YMSIG), an investment and property development company founded by the Yancheng Municipal Government, purchased Aoxin Automobile
from Dongfeng Motor, Co. Ltd. YMSIG has made major investments in Aoxin, which funded on a fast track schedule the completion
of the e-Go automobile manufacturing facility that culminated in a grand opening ceremony on January 20, 2015. 

The
e-Go EV is a unique concept electric vehicle. It will be the only production line electric vehicle with a carbon fiber body manufactured
by a new process that uses robotics to produce parts, which significantly reduces the production time and cost of carbon fiber
components. The carbon fiber composite material is five times stronger than steel, and one third the weight.  

The
exclusive license contract between 2050 Motors and Aoxin Automobile requires that 2050 Motors complete US crash testing according
to US Department of Transportation ( DOT ) safety standards. 2050 Motors has entered into negotiations with Calspan
Corporation ( Calspan ). Calspan is committed to the evolution of safety in the air and on the ground, and has assisted
in developing new aircraft; training world-class test pilots; performing ground-breaking automobile accident research; and contributing
to safety innovations on the ground and in the air over its 70-year history. It s important to note that one of the three
demonstration vehicles shipped to the United States in February, 2016 will be used to evaluate this overlap crash test at Calspan s
facilities during the summer of 2016. This will be a definitive evaluation of the effectiveness of the design modifications incorporated
into the e-Go EV vehicle. There is no assurance that the e-Go EV will pass this crash test in June 2016 or at any other time.  

2050
Motors intends to import vehicles completely fabricated and assembled in China from Aoxin Automobile. 2050 Motors will market
the e-Go EV vehicles in designated markets and is not expected to need any raw materials, components or equipment, except spare
parts which will be supplied by Aoxin Automobile. However, the e-Go EV and all of its parts and equipment must be DOT approved.
After the demonstration vehicles are delivered to the USA, some of the existing parts of the e-Go EV may or may not meet DOT specifications.
Aoxin Automobile has made every effort to build the e-Go EV according to American standards. However, there is no certainty that
all the parts will be DOT approved. 2050 Motors may elect to secure replacement parts here in the USA or in China for installation
either in the United States or in China, if required.  

2050
Motors intends to initially sell the e-Go EV to a network of customers primarily in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. 2050 Motors plans
to establish a service and parts center, which would be separate from the Showroom. The Showroom facility will be at an area with
high volume of people in Las Vegas, where visitors to the city can directly view the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may also elect to sell
the e-Go EV at selected distributors in the Las Vegas Area, which have already provided letters of interest to sell our vehicles.
2050 Motors  initial plan is not to sell the vehicle outside of the Las Vegas vicinity, consisting of an area within a radius
of 100 miles. This is the Company s current marketing plan in order to effectively market to and support people that work
and/or live in Las Vegas. In the metropolitan area of Las Vegas the population equals 1.9 million.  

2050
Motors is a development stage company with no operating history and may never be able to carry out its business plan or achieve
any revenues or profitability. 2050 Motors was established in October 2012 and it has not generated any revenues nor has it realized
a profit from its operations to date, and there is little likelihood that it will generate any revenues or realize any profits
in the short term. Any profitability in the future from its business will be dependent upon the successful marketing and sales
of the e-Go EV. 2050 Motors may not be able to successfully carry out its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will
ever achieve any revenues or profitability. Accordingly, its prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and
difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a new business, especially one in the automobile industry, and therefore it
is a highly speculative venture involving significant financial risk.  

We
are completely dependent on Aoxin Automobile to supply us with the e-Go EV and other trucks and automobiles and parts and components
thereto. The inability of Aoxin Automobile to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver such vehicles and parts at prices
and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results. Changes in
business conditions, global financial instability, wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we
do not presently anticipate, could also affect Aoxin Automobile s ability to deliver vehicles and/or parts on a timely basis
and cause material adverse consequences to 2050 Motors.  

Research
by Aoxin Automobile over the past five years developed this advanced all-electric vehicle. The e-Go EV is a five passenger sedan
which weighs only 1,450 lbs with its battery pack included. It will be the first vehicle of this advanced type to be sold in the
price range of less than $35,000.  

The
body components are built out of carbon fiber which is five times stronger than steel and one third its weight constructed over
a strong ultra light aluminum frame chassis and race car suspension. This ensures that the vehicle will be one of the safest and
strongest ever built for the consumer market. It will also be the most efficient vehicle ever built, capable of achieving 150+
miles to the gallon energy equivalent.  

2050
Motors projects expenses associated with its business over the next 6 months to be approximately $1,000,000. The primary cost
component will be related to meeting the crash testing requirements of the DOT.  

Costs
and Resources   

The
Company believes that its current capital resources and current funding will enable it to maintain its current and planned operations
through the next 6 months. The Company anticipates, however, that it will need to raise additional capital in order to sustain
and grow its operations over the next few years.  

To
the extent that the Company s capital resources are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements, the
Company will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners,
licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. The
Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and the Company does not anticipate
that existing shareholders will provide any portion of the Company s future financing requirements. No assurance can be
given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to
the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of
its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company.  

Results
of Operation for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no operation revenues. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 the Company incurred operating expenses of $414,411 consisting primarily of expenses related to research   development,
marketing, engineering and consulting for SEC compliance and reporting. Similarly, during the nine months ended September 30,
2015, the Company incurred operating expenses of $460,468. These operating expenses plus interest expenses, along with the lack
of revenues, resulted in net losses of $427,050 and $469,442 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a stockholders  deficit of $51,747 compared to a stockholders  equity of
$218,198 on September 30, 2015. The decrease in stockholders  equity was due to a net loss of $427,050 and the issuance,
and commitment to issue, common stock valued at $157,105 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Equity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $2,202,848 and common stock issuable of $135,000. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has a cash balance of $10,370 and a negative working capital of $231,100.  

To
date, we have funded our operations through short-term debt and equity financing. In February of 2016, the Company obtained a
$100,000 revolving line of credit and, as of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance is $101,400. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company has issued, or has committed to issue, 1,035,000 shares of its common stock for services valued
at $156,480 and 200,000 shares for cash totaling $10,000. The proceeds from the funding were used to pay fees and expenses, to
the extent that such expenses are not deferred, arising from the Company s compliance with its public reporting requirements
and to continue to proceed with its business plan to market, develop and sell electric automobiles.  

We
expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operational expenses and
the development of our automobile business. However, we do not expect to start generating revenues from our operations for another
12 months. Consequently, we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and
implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion
of our business plan, which would have a material adverse affect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition.
There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of additional capital or that our estimates of our capital
requirements will prove to be accurate. As of the date of this Report we did not have any commitments from any source to provide
such additional capital. Even if we are able to secure outside financing, it may not be available in the amounts or the times
when we require. Furthermore, such financing would likely take the form of bank loans, private placement of debt or equity securities
or some combination of these. The issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of current investors
while incurring loans, leases or debt would increase our capital requirements and possible loss of valuable assets if such obligations
were not repaid in accordance with their terms.

2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

On
September 30, 2016, the Company sold 200,000 shares of its restricted common stock to an unrelated third party for $10,000.  

On
October 3, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares to 9 individuals. All of the
issuees were officers, directors or consultants to the Company. The shares were issued for services rendered to the Company over
the last year and were valued at $0.028, which was 60% of the average quoted price of the stock for the last five trading days.  

On
October 26, 2016, the Company signed a Convertible Promissory Note (the  Note ) with an unrelated party. The principle
amount of the note is $65,000 and accrues twelve percent interest per annum and matures on July 26, 2017, but contains an on demand
provision by the Issuer. This note shall not be convertible for the first 180 days after the Issuance Date. After the 180 th
 day, the  Conversion Price  will be the lower of: (i) a 50% discount to the lowest trading price during the
previous twenty (20) trading days to the date of Conversion; or (ii) a 50% discount to the lowest trading price during the previous
twenty (20) trading days before the date that this note was executed.  

On
November 1, 2016, the Company executed four $10,000 Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes (the  Notes) with three third
party investors. The Notes are (i) due and payable on or before April 30, 2017, (ii) carry and interest rate of 12% per annum
payable monthly and (iii) are convertible into common stock at $0.075 per share.  

We
relied upon Section 4(2) and Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the issuances of the securities listed
above. Each prospective investor had access to the Company s Form 10-K and Form 8-K s previously filed with the SEC.
These filings included all material aspects of an investment in us, including the business, management, offering details, risk
factors and consolidated financial statements. It is the belief of management that each of the individuals who invested has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment
and therefore did not need the protections offered by registering their shares under Securities and Act of 1933, as amended. This
offering was not accompanied by general advertisement or general solicitation and any Note or share certificates to be issued
upon conversion will be issued with a Rule 144 restrictive legend. No commissions were paid in regard to any of the offerings.
