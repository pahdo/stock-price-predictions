Note 1  .  Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form  10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all material adjustments which are of a normal and recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented have been reflected.  Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted. 
  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The terms "Corporation," "Kimberly-Clark," "K-C," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  Annual Goodwill Impairment Assessment 
  Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses.  Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is assessed for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.  Impairment testing compares the reporting unit carrying amount of goodwill with its fair value.  If the reporting unit carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded.  In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical and projected financial performance, significant changes in the reporting unit and the magnitude of excess fair value over carrying amount from the previous quantitative impairment testing.  If the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test using discounted cash flows to estimate fair value must be performed.  On the other hand, if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying value, then further quantitative testing is not required.  For 2016, we have completed the required annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment as of the first day of the third quarter, and have determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than the carrying amount for each of our reporting units. 
  Accounting for Venezuelan Operations 
  Effective December 31, 2015, we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of our business in Venezuela from our consolidated balance sheet and moved to the cost method of accounting for our operations in that country.  As of the first quarter of 2016, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan business in our consolidated financial statements.  The change resulted in the recognition of an after tax charge of   $102   in 2015 and other income of   $11   related to an updated assessment in 2016.  In addition, we recorded a non-deductible charge of   $45   related to a balance sheet remeasurement in 2015.  Net sales of K C Venezuela were insignificant in 2015. 
  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes    
  In 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . Under this ASU, a reporting entity is required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Current guidance requiring the offsetting of deferred tax assets and liabilities of a tax-paying component of an entity and presentation as a single noncurrent amount is not affected.  We early adopted this ASU prospectively as of March 31, 2016 and our consolidated balance sheet reflects the new guidance for classification of deferred taxes.  Prior periods were not recasted.  
  New Accounting Standards 
  In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  .  The new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  For public companies, the amendments in this standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted.  The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are not expected to be material.   
  In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition,  
  
   7 

measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  The ASU requires additional disclosures.  The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The ASU requires adoption based upon a modified retrospective transition approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are not yet known. 
  In 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.  In 2016, the FASB issued four amendments to the ASU.  The standard is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of one year prior to the current effective date.  The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards.  The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are not expected to be material.  

Note 2  .  2014 Organization Restructuring 
  In 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business.  The restructuring is intended to improve our underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth.  The plan is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with total costs, primarily severance, anticipated to be toward the high end of the range of   $130   to   $160   after tax (  $190   to   $230   pretax).  Cash costs are projected to be approximately   80 percent   of the total charges.  The restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies.  
  Total charges were   $15   (  $12   after tax) and   $36   (  $20   after tax) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Through   September 30, 2016  , cumulative pretax charges for the restructuring were   $211   (  $149   after tax).  Cash payments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 related to the restructuring were   $49   and   $65  , respectively. 

Note 3  .  Fair Value Information 
  The following fair value information is based on a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The three levels in the hierarchy used to measure fair value are: 
  Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible at the reporting date for identical assets and liabilities. 
  Level 2   Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not considered active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
  Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are significant to the valuation and are unobservable. 
  A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and for the full year   2015  , there were   no   significant transfers among level 1, 2, or 3 fair value determinations.  
  Company-owned life insurance ("COLI") assets and derivative assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis at fair value.  COLI assets were   $60   and   $57   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The COLI policies are a source of funding primarily for our nonqualified employee benefits and are included in other assets.  The fair value amount of the COLI policies is measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and therefore, is not classified in the fair value hierarchy. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , derivative assets were   $36   and   $56  , respectively, and derivative liabilities were   $26   and   $42  , respectively.  The fair values of derivatives used to manage interest rate risk and commodity price risk are based on LIBOR rates and interest rate swap curves and NYMEX price quotations, respectively.  The fair value of hedging instruments used to manage foreign currency risk is based on published quotations of spot currency rates and forward points, which are converted into implied forward currency rates.  Measurement of our derivative assets and liabilities is considered a level 2 measurement.  Additional information on our classification and use of derivative instruments is contained in   Note 7  . 
  Redeemable preferred securities of subsidiaries are measured on a recurring basis at fair value and were   $64   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  They are not traded in active markets.  For certain redeemable securities, fair values were calculated using a floating rate pricing model that compared the stated spread to the fair value spread to determine the price at which each of the financial instruments should trade. The model used the following inputs to calculate fair values: face value, current LIBOR  
  
   8 

rate, unobservable fair value credit spread, stated spread, maturity date and interest or dividend payment dates.  The fair value of the remaining redeemable securities was based on various inputs, including an independent third-party appraisal, adjusted for current market conditions.  Measurement of the redeemable preferred securities is considered a level 3 measurement.  
  The following table includes the fair value of our financial instruments for which disclosure of fair value is required: 

(a) 
    Cash equivalents are composed of certificates of deposit, time deposits and other interest-bearing investments with original maturity dates of 90 days or less.  Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. 
              (b) 
    Time deposits are composed of deposits with original maturities of more than 90 days but less than one year and instruments with original maturities of greater than one year, included in other current assets or other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as appropriate. Other, included in other current assets, is composed of funds held in escrow.  Time deposits and other are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.  
              (c) 
    Short-term debt is composed of U.S. commercial paper and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-U.S. subsidiaries, all of which are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. 
              (d) 
    Long-term debt includes the current portion of these debt instruments.  Fair values were estimated based on quoted prices for financial instruments for which all significant inputs were observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Note 4  .  Employee Postretirement Benefits 
  The table below presents net periodic benefit cost information for defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans: 

Effective January 2015, the U.S. pension plan was amended to include a lump-sum pension benefit payout option for certain plan participants.  In addition, in April 2015, the U.S. pension plan completed the purchase of group annuity contracts that transferred to two insurance companies the pension benefit obligations totaling   $2.5   billion for approximately   21,000   Kimberly-Clark retirees in the United States.  As a result of these changes, we recognized pension settlement-related charges of   $0.8 billion   after tax (  $1.4  
  
   9 

billion   pretax in other (income) and expense, net) during 2015, mostly in the second quarter.  In connection with these transactions, during the first quarter of   2015   we made a   $410   contribution to our U.S. pension plan in order to maintain the plan s funded status.   
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made cash contributions of   $35   and   $437  , respectively, to our pension trusts.  We expect to contribute up to   $100   to our defined benefit pension plans for the full year 2016. 

Note 5  .  Earnings Per Share ("EPS") 
  There are no adjustments required to be made to net income for purposes of computing EPS.  A reconciliation of the average number of common shares outstanding used in the basic and diluted EPS computations follows: 

Options outstanding that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares were insignificant. 
  The number of common shares outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   358.4 million   and   363.3 million  , respectively. 

Note 6  .  Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) 
  Set forth below is a reconciliation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of the carrying amount of total stockholders' equity (deficit) from the beginning of the period to the end of the period.   

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   4.0   million shares at a total cost of   $525     pursuant to a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. 
  Net unrealized currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except those in highly inflationary economies, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI").  For these operations, changes in exchange rates generally do not affect cash flows; therefore, unrealized translation is recorded in AOCI rather than net income.  Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of any of these subsidiaries, the applicable unrealized translation would be removed from AOCI and reported as part of the gain or loss on the sale or liquidation.  
  Also included in unrealized translation are the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature and transactions designated as hedges of net foreign investments.  
  
   10 

The change in net unrealized currency translation for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, including the Brazilian real, South Korean won, Australian dollar, euro and Russian ruble, partially offset by the weakening of the British pound sterling.  
  The changes in the components of AOCI attributable to Kimberly-Clark, net of tax, are as follows: 

(a) 
    Included in computation of net periodic pension costs (see Note   4  ). 
     During the first quarter of   2015  , we acquired the remaining   49.9   percent interest in our subsidiary in Israel, Hogla-Kimberly, Ltd., for   $151  .  As our subsidiary in Turkey was wholly-owned by our subsidiary in Israel, through this acquisition we also effectively acquired the remaining   49.9   percent interest in our subsidiary in Turkey, Kimberly-Clark Tuketim Mallari Sanayi ve Ticaret A.s.  
  The purchase of additional ownership in an already controlled subsidiary is treated as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recognized in consolidated net income or comprehensive income.  The effect of the change in ownership interest is as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
      Net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation 
      
    $ 
    680 
      
      Decrease in Kimberly-Clark Corporation's additional paid-in capital for acquisition 
      
    (94 
    ) 
      Change from net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and transfers to noncontrolling interests 
      
    $ 
    586 

Note 7  .  Objectives and Strategies for Using Derivatives 
  As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to financial risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.  We employ a number of practices to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where appropriate, the use of derivative instruments.  We enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies for non-U.S. operations' purchases of raw materials, which are priced in U.S. dollars, and imports of intercompany finished goods and work-in-process priced predominantly in U.S. dollars and euros.  The derivative instruments used to manage these exposures are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The foreign currency exposure on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany loans and accounts payable, is hedged with primarily undesignated derivative instruments. 
  Interest rate risk is managed using a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments.  Interest rate swap contracts may be used to facilitate the maintenance of the desired ratio of variable- and fixed-rate debt and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges.  From time to time, we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt, using forward-starting swaps, and these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. 
  We use derivative instruments, such as forward swap contracts, to hedge a limited portion of our exposure to market risk arising from changes in prices of certain commodities.  These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of specific quantities of the underlying commodity expected to be purchased in future months. 
  
   11 

Translation adjustments result from translating foreign entities' financial statements into U.S. dollars from their functional currencies.  The risk to any particular entity's net assets is reduced to the extent that the entity is financed with local currency borrowing.  Translation exposure, which results from changes in translation rates between functional currencies and the U.S. dollar, generally is not hedged.  However, consistent with other years, a portion of our net investment in our Mexican affiliate has been hedged.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had in place net investment hedges of   $59   for a portion of our investment in our Mexican affiliate. 
  Set forth below is a summary of the designated and undesignated fair values of our derivative instruments: 

The derivative assets are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current assets and other assets, as appropriate.  The derivative liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities, as appropriate. 
  Derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are predominantly used to manage interest rate risk.  The fair values of these derivative instruments are recorded as an asset or liability, as appropriate, with the offset recorded in current earnings.  The offset to the change in fair values of the related hedged items also is recorded in current earnings.  Any realized gain or loss on the derivatives that hedge interest rate risk is amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional values of outstanding interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges were   $375  .    Fair value hedges resulted in no significant ineffectiveness in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, gains or losses recognized in interest expense for interest rate swaps were not significant.    For the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   gain or loss was recognized in earnings as a result of a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying as a fair value hedge.   
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially recorded in AOCI, net of related income taxes, and recognized in earnings in the same period that the hedged exposure affects earnings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , outstanding commodity forward contracts were in place to hedge a limited portion of our estimated requirements of the related underlying commodities in the remainder of   2016   and future periods.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional value of outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges was   $770  , and there were   no   outstanding interest rate derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges.    Cash flow hedges resulted in no significant ineffectiveness for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to the original forecasted transaction no longer being probable of occurring.  As of   September 30, 2016  , amounts to be reclassified from AOCI during the next twelve months are not expected to be material.  The maximum maturity of cash flow hedges in place at   September 30, 2016   is   August 2019  . 
  Gains or losses on undesignated foreign exchange hedging instruments are immediately recognized in other (income) and expense, net.  Gains of   $5   and losses of   $77   were recorded in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Gains of   $19   and losses of   $158   were recorded in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The effect on earnings from the use of these non-designated derivatives is substantially neutralized by the transactional gains and losses recorded on the underlying assets and liabilities.

    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     Introduction 
  This management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects.  The following will be discussed and analyzed:

    Business Outlook 
     We describe our business outside North America in two groups   Developing and Emerging Markets ("D E") and Developed Markets.  D E markets comprise Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, excluding Australia and South Korea.  Developed Markets consist of Western and Central Europe, Australia and South Korea. 
  This section presents a discussion and analysis of our   third   quarter   2016   net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of the results of operations.  Our analysis of the results for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 reflects comparison to the same three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.  In addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling price on net sales. Changes in foreign currency rates also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. 
  Throughout this MD A, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures.  These measures include adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate.  We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.   
  Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations to these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to the GAAP measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures.   
  The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this MD A: 
             
    2014 Organization Restructuring - In 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business.  Results in both 2016 and 2015 include charges related to this initiative.  See additional information in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. 
                
    Pension settlement charges - In 2015, we recorded settlement-related charges from certain actions taken for our U.S. pension plan.  See additional information in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. 
                
    Turkey restructuring - In 2015, we recorded charges related to the restructuring of our operations in Turkey. 
                
    Adjustments related to Venezuelan Operations - In 2016 and 2015, we recorded adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations.  See additional information in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.  
     Overview of   Third   Quarter   2016   Results 
             
    Net sales of $4.6 billion decreased approximately 3 percent compared to the prior year, as changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced net sales by more than 2 percent.  Organic sales were essentially even with prior year.  Organic sales increased 3 percent in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere.

Net sales of $4.6 billion in the third quarter of 2016 decreased 3 percent compared to prior year.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by more than 2 percent.  Organic sales were essentially even with last year.   
  Third quarter operating profit was $836 in 2016 and $779 in 2015.

Adjusted operating profit of $836 in the third quarter of 2016 increased 1 percent compared to $826 in the prior year.  The increase included benefits from $105 in cost savings from the company s FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program and $15 of savings from the 2014 Organization Restructuring.  Input costs decreased $10, mostly due to lower fiber costs.  Translation

effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered operating profit by $10 and transaction effects also negatively impacted the comparison.  Results in 2016 were also impacted by slightly lower net selling prices and unfavorable product mix, along with ongoing manufacturing-related cost increases. 
  Net sales for the first nine months of 2016 of $13.7 billion decreased approximately 3 percent compared to prior year, as changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by more than 4 percent.  Organic sales increased about 2 percent due to higher sales volumes. 
  Year-to-date operating profit was $2,478 in 2016 compared to $983 in 2015.  Results in 2015 included $1,350 of pension settlement-related charges.  Adjusted operating profit of $2,482 in 2016 increased 2 percent compared to $2,431 in 2015.  Results in 2016 included $295 of FORCE cost savings and $45 of savings from the 2014 Organization Restructuring.  In addition, input costs were $60 lower.  Translation effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered operating profit by $85 and transaction effects also negatively impacted results. 
  Other (Income) and Expense, Net   Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 
  Other (income) and expense, net includes the following adjusting items:   

  Adjusted other (income) and expense, net improved due to lower foreign currency transaction losses in 2016 compared to the prior year.  
  Provision for Income Taxes   Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 
  Provision for income taxes includes the following adjusting items: 

The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 is due to resolution of certain tax matters and benefits from certain tax planning initiatives. 
  Share of Net Income of Equity Companies 
  Our share of net income of equity companies was $33 and $37 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $103 and $112 for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. results were negatively impacted by a weaker Mexican peso, mostly offset by benefits from organic sales growth, lower input costs and cost savings.

Net Income Attributable to Kimberly-Clark and Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP 
  Net Income Attributable to Kimberly-Clark and Diluted Earnings Per Share     include the following adjusting items:

Third quarter net sales of $2.3 billion decreased 2 percent compared to prior year.  Unfavorable currency rates reduced sales 3 percent.  Sales volumes increased approximately 3 percent while changes in net selling prices decreased sales by 1 percent.  Third quarter operating profit of $458 decreased 5 percent.  The comparison was impacted by unfavorable currency effects, changes in net selling prices and product mix and increased marketing, research and general spending on a local currency basis, partially offset by volume growth and cost savings.

Child care volumes rose double-digits, with benefits from innovations and category growth.  Baby wipes volumes also increased double-digits and market shares improved.  Huggies diaper and adult care volumes were down low single-digits and mid-single digits, respectively, compared to double-digit growth in the year-ago period that included benefits from innovation launches and increased promotion shipments.  Adult care volumes in 2016 were also impacted by competitive promotion activity. 
  Net sales in developing and emerging markets decreased 4 percent, including an 8 percent impact from unfavorable currency rates.  Sales volumes increased 4 percent, with gains in China, Eastern Europe and the Middle East/Africa, and declines in Argentina and Brazil.  Overall changes in net selling prices were even year-on-year, as increases in response to weaker currency rates and local cost inflation, primarily in Latin America, were offset by decreases in China. 
  Net sales in developed markets outside North America increased 1 percent.  Sales volumes advanced 2 percent and changes in product mix improved sales slightly, while changes in net selling prices decreased sales by 2 percent.

Changes in product/mix other reduced sales slightly, including an approximate 1 percent impact from lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health, Inc.  Third quarter operating profit of $157 increased 2 percent.  The comparison benefited from higher net selling prices and cost savings, mostly offset by unfavorable currency effects and lower volumes. 
  Net sales in North America increased 1 percent due to higher net selling prices.  Overall sales volumes were even year-on-year, as growth in washroom products was offset by declines in other categories.  
  Net sales in developing and emerging markets decreased 1 percent, including a 5 percent negative impact from unfavorable currency rates.  Changes in net selling prices increased sales by 4 percent, primarily in Latin America. Changes in product mix improved sales by 1 percent, while sales volumes fell 2 percent.

Volumes fell 6 percent while the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix increased sales by 1 percent.  The volume decline was driven by results in Western/Central Europe.  

2014 Organization Restructuring 
  In 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business.  The restructuring is intended to improve underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth.  The plan is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with total costs, primarily severance, anticipated to be toward the high end of the range of   $130   to   $160   after tax (  $190   to   $230   pretax).  Cash costs are projected to be approximately   80 percent   of the total charges.  Cumulative pretax savings from the restructuring are expected to be toward the high end of the range of $120 to $140 by the end of 2017, and were   $115   through   September 30, 2016  .  The restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies. Total charges were   $15   (  $12   after tax) and   $36   (  $20   after tax) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Provided by Operations 
  Cash provided by operations was   $2.4 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $1.6 billion   in the prior year.  The increase included benefits from improved working capital and lower pension contributions.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , defined benefit pension plan contributions were $35 and $437, respectively.  
  Investing 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , our capital spending was   $582   compared to   $798   in the prior year.  We anticipate that full-year 2016 capital spending will be somewhat below the previous target range of $950 to $1,050.   
  Financing 
  On February 22, 2016, we issued $400 aggregate principal amount of 1.40% notes due February 15, 2019 and $400 aggregate principal amount of 2.75% notes due February 15, 2026.  Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. 
  On July 29, 2016, we issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 3.20% notes due July 30, 2046.  Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. 
  Our short-term debt, which consists of U.S. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-U.S. subsidiaries, was   $242   as of   September 30, 2016   (included in debt payable within one year on the Consolidated Balance Sheet).  The average month-end balance of short-term debt for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $325  .  These short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations.  The level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , total debt was   $7.6 billion   compared to   $7.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2021.  This facility, currently unused, supports our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason. 
  We repurchase shares of Kimberly-Clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we repurchased 4.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $525 through a broker in the open market. We are targeting full-year   2016   share repurchases of $750 subject to market conditions. 
  Business Outlook 
  In 2016, we plan to continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies, which include a focus on targeted growth initiatives, innovation and brand building, cost savings programs and shareholder-friendly capital allocation.  In 2016, we expect diluted earnings per share in a range of $5.92 to $6.05 (prior outlook $5.92 to $6.15) and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.05 (prior outlook $5.95 to $6.15). The adjusted earnings per share excludes expected 2014 Organization Restructuring charges equivalent to $0.03 to $0.06 and the positive impact of an adjustment related to Venezuela recorded in the second quarter equivalent to $0.03. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance is based on the assumptions described below: 
             
    Growth in organic sales of 2 percent compared to the previously assumed growth at the low end of the 3 to 5 percent range.  
                
    Negative foreign currency translation effects on net sales and operating profit of 4 and 3 percent, respectively (prior assumption of 4 to 5 percent range for each).  
                
    Net impact of changes in commodity costs to be between $25 and $125 of deflation year-on-year. 
                 
    Full-year 2016 effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate will both be approximately at the lower end of the 30.5 to 32.5 percent target range. 
                
    Our share of net income from equity companies to be down somewhat, compared to 2015.

              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
