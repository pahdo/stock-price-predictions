GENERAL INFORMATION   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these interim
financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of the Company, as defined below, these unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary
to present fairly the information set forth herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Results for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year.  

These
unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and
notes included in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

Power
REIT (the  Registrant  or the  Trust , and together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  we ,
 us , the  Company  or  Power REIT , unless the context requires otherwise) is a Maryland-domiciled
real estate investment trust (a  REIT ) that holds, develops, acquires and manages real estate assets related to transportation
and energy infrastructure in the United States. Within the transportation and energy infrastructure sectors, Power REIT is focused
on making new acquisitions of real estate that are or will be leased to renewable energy generation projects, such as utility-scale
solar farms and wind farms, that have low or minimal technology risk.  

The
Trust is structured as a holding company and owns its assets through four wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiaries that have
been formed in order to hold real estate assets, obtain financing and generate lease revenue. As of September 30, 2016, the Trust s
assets consisted of approximately 112 miles of railroad infrastructure and related real estate which is owned by its subsidiary
Pittsburgh   West Virginia Railroad ( P WV ) and approximately 601 acres of fee simple land leased to a number
of solar power generating projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 108 Megawatts ( MW ). Power
REIT is actively seeking to expand its portfolio of real estate related to renewable energy generation projects and is pursuing
investment opportunities that qualify for REIT ownership within solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, transmission and other
infrastructure projects.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Trust paid a quarterly dividend of approximately $70,000 ($0.48375 per share) on Power
REIT s 7.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Trust paid a quarterly dividend of approximately $210,000 ($1.45313 per share) on Power REIT s 7.75% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock.  

The
Trust was formed as part of a reorganization and reverse triangular merger of P WV that closed on December 2, 2011. P WV
survived the reorganization as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trust.  

The
Trust has elected to be treated for tax purposes as a REIT, which means that it is exempt from U.S. federal income tax if a sufficient
portion of its annual income is distributed to its shareholders, and if certain other requirements are met. In order for the Trust
to maintain its REIT qualification, at least 90% of its ordinary taxable annual income must be distributed to shareholders.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Accounting
Pronouncement Adopted   

As
of January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-3,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires debt issuance
costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the associated debt liability. This standard requires retrospective
application, and as such, we reclassified approximately $438,000 of debt issuance costs from other assets to a reduction of our
current and long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.  

Other
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No 2016-09  Compensation - Stock compensation  (Topic 718). The new guidance is intended to simplify some provisions
in stock compensation accounting, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements,
as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We expect to adopt this standard when effective, and the impact on our financial
statements is not currently estimable.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-02  Leases  (Topic 842). The standard requires companies that lease valuable
assets like aircraft, real estate, and heavy equipment to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities generated
by contracts longer than a year. The standard also requires companies to disclose in the footnotes to their financial statements
information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty for the payments they make for the lease agreements. This standard is effective
for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We expect to adopt this standard
when effective, and the impact on our financial statements is not currently estimable.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ,
Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10). The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of
financial instruments. This guidance requires that financial assets and financial liabilities must be separately presented by
measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. This
guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard includes a requirement
that businesses must report changes in the fair value of their own liabilities in other comprehensive income (loss) instead of
earnings, and this is the only provision of the update for which the FASB is permitting early adoption. We expect to adopt this
guidance when effective, and do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include Power REIT and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  

Fair
Value   

Fair
value represents the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. The Trust measures its financial assets and liabilities in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets
and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.  

POWER
REIT AND SUBSIDIARIES   

   Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   

Level
    1   valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, or interest in open-end mutual funds that
    allow a company to sell its ownership interest back at net asset value on a daily basis. Valuations are obtained from readily
    available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets, liabilities or funds.   

Level
    2   valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer, or broker markets, such as quoted prices for
    similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 includes U.S. Treasury, U.S. government
    and agency debt securities, and certain corporate obligations. Valuations are usually obtained from third party pricing services
    for identical or comparable assets or liabilities.   

Level
    3   valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other valuation methodologies, such as option pricing
    models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, and not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions.
    Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or
    liabilities.   

In
determining fair value, the Trust utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considering counterparty credit risk.  

The
carrying amounts of Power REIT s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and accounts payable
approximate fair value because of their relatively short maturity. Long-term debt approximates fair value since the related rates
of interest approximate current market rates. The Company does not have any financial instruments that are required to be measured
and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

LONG-TERM DEBT   

On
November 6, 2015, PWRS completed a financing secured by the real property owned by PWRS (the  PWRS Bonds ). The PWRS
Bonds are secured by land owned by PWRS and have a total obligation of $10,150,000. The PWRS Bonds carry a fixed interest rate
of 4.34% and mature in 2034. The use of proceeds from the PWRS Bonds was to retire approximately $6,650,000 of existing indebtedness
and the associated swap that was entered which are secured by the PWRS property; retire the $1,650,000 million loan to PW Tulare
Solar, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Power REIT) from Hudson Bay Partners, LP (an affiliate of David H. Lesser - Chairman
and CEO of Power REIT) including accrued interest; pay deferred financing costs of approximately $441,000; pay interest rate swaps
of approximately $670,000; pay approximately $180,000 of unpaid fees; and, to pay other accounts payable of Power REIT and its
subsidiaries. The balance of the PWRS Bonds as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is approximately $9,461,000 (net of
approximately $398,000 of capitalized debt costs which are being amortized over the life of the financing) and $10,150,000 respectively.  

On
July 5, 2013, PWSS borrowed $750,000 from a regional bank (the  PWSS Term Loan ) to refinance a bridge loan that had
been extended by HBP in connection with PWSS  acquisition of leased property in December 2012. The PWSS Term Loan carries
a fixed interest rate of 5.0%, a term of 10-years and amortizes based on a twenty-year principal amortization schedule. In addition
to being secured by PWSS  real estate assets, the term loan is secured by a parent guarantee from the Trust. The balance
of the PWSS Term Loan as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is approximately $656,000 (net of approximately $18,000 of
capitalized debt costs which are being amortized over the life of the financing) and $678,000 (net of approximately $21,000 of
capitalized debt costs which are being amortized over the life of the financing), respectively.

On
December 31, 2012, as part of the Salisbury land acquisition, PWSS assumed existing municipal financing ( Municipal Debt ).
The Municipal Debt has approximately 16 years remaining. The Municipal Debt has a simple interest rate of 5.0% that is paid annually,
with the next payment due February 1, 2017. The balance of the Municipal Debt as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is
approximately $96,000 and $103,000 respectively.

EQUITY AND LONG-TERM COMPENSATION   

Summary
of Stock Based Compensation Activity   Options   

The
summary of stock based compensation activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with respect to the Trust s stock
options, was as follows:  

The
Aggregate Intrinsic Value is based on the difference between the option exercise price and the closing stock price of $8.12 at
September 30, 2016 and $8.60 at December 31, 2015. Since the Weighted Average Exercise Price is below the closing price of
$8.12 at September 30, 2016 the Aggregate Intrinsic Value is $16,960 at September 30, 2016. The weighted average
remaining term of the options is 5.87 years.  

Summary
of Plan Activity   Restricted Stock   

The
summary of Plan activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with respect to the Trust s restricted stock, was

Stock-based
Compensation   

During
the first nine months of 2016, the Trust recorded approximately $142,000 of non-cash expense related to restricted stock and options
granted compared to approximately $150,000 for the first nine months of 2015. As of September 30, 2016 there was approximately
$259,000 of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which expense will be recognized through the first quarter of
2019, equating to a weighted average amortization period of approximately 1.5 years from the issuance date. The Trust does not
currently have a policy regarding the repurchase of shares on the open market related to equity awards and does not currently
intend to acquire shares on the open market.  

Preferred
Stock Dividends   

During
the first nine months of 2016, the Trust paid a total of approximately $210,000 of dividends to holders of Power REIT s
Series A Preferred Stock.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

As
previously disclosed in its public filings with the SEC, the Trust and its wholly-owned subsidiary P WV are in litigation
with NSC and NSC s sub-lessee, Wheeling   Lake Erie Railroad ( WLE  and, together with NSC, the  Litigants )
concerning matters arising under the Railroad Lease. The case was pending in Federal trial court in Pittsburgh (the  Court ).
The Litigants initiated the litigation against the Trust and P WV in December 2011, seeking, among other things, a declaratory
judgment that NSC was not in default under the Railroad Lease.  

P WV,
as lessor, has asserted counterclaims, seeking determinations that NSC is in default under the Railroad Lease for, among other
things, failing to reimburse P WV for certain legal fees incurred by P WV, failing to permit P WV to inspect NSC s
books and records as called for under the terms of the Railroad Lease and failing to pay other amounts that P WV believes
are due and owing. P WV also seeks declarations from the Court (a) that NSC s obligation to repay the indebtedness owed
under the Railroad Lease is not indefinite in duration, and (b) that the indebtedness owed to P WV is due on demand with interest.
If P WV is successful with certain of its counterclaims, it can terminate the Railroad Lease and demand from NSC payment of
the indebtedness.  

The
indebtedness is the cumulative result of amounts received by NSC from its dispositions of P WV property, additional rental
amounts due and other sums that NSC owes to P WV but which NSC has elected, under its interpretation of the Railroad Lease,
to pay by increasing its indebtedness to P WV rather than by providing P WV with cash. According to records maintained
by NSC pursuant to the Railroad Lease and provided by NSC to P WV, as of December 31, 2012 the indebtedness owed to P WV
was approximately $16,600,000. NSC has not provided a more recent update of the indebtedness amount. P WV believes that the
indebtedness amount is understated. The indebtedness has not been included in P WV s balance sheets prepared under GAAP,
because of the dispute as to when it is due. Similarly, certain additional rental amounts that NSC disputes are due on a current
basis, and which have historically been treated as indebtedness, have not been included in P WV s income statements
or balance sheets prepared under GAAP; however, these additional rent amounts have historically been recorded as taxable income
on P WV s tax returns.  

The
Litigants have alleged that the Trust is a successor in interest in respect of the Railroad Lease. If that allegation were to
be decided against us in a fact-finding stage of the litigation, it could lead to liability and expenses. The Trust believes that
it is not a successor in interest in respect of the Railroad Lease and is not constrained by any of the Railroad Lease restrictions.  

POWER
REIT AND SUBSIDIARIES   

   Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   

The
parties have made certain supplements to their respective claims and counterclaims. In August 2013, P WV filed a second supplement
to its counterclaims following the Litigants  disclosure of previously undisclosed dispositions of P WV property. P WV
believes that additional amounts are owed to it as a result of these dispositions and, accordingly, asserted new counterclaims,
including claims of fraud and conversion. Based on the information available at the time P WV supplemented its claims, P WV
has estimated that the additional amounts owed to it exceed $8 million, not including potential interest and damages. P WV
also supplemented its counterclaim for additional rental amounts due in order to include the reimbursement of its legal expenses
related to the litigation. In response to P WV s second supplement to its counterclaims, in January 2014 the Litigants
amended their pleadings to add additional claims against both P WV and the Trust. The Litigants  new claims seek additional
declarations from the Court that the Litigants have not defaulted on or violated the terms of the Railroad Lease.  

On
September 13, 2013, the Trust filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all of the claims against it primarily
based on the fact that the Trust is not a party to the Lease. On January 15, 2014, the Court heard oral arguments from the parties
on the Trust s motion. On October 16, 2013, the Litigants filed a motion seeking leave to supplement their claims to include:
(i) nominal damages, (ii) enjoinment of Power REIT from taking actions in breach of the Lease Agreement, (iii) the withdrawal
of NSC s consent to the additional share by PWV; and (iv) the undoing of the reverse triangular merger. On June 19, 2014,
the court denied the Trust s motion but also denied Plaintiff s motion seeking leave to supplement their claims with
the exception of granting the motion to seek nominal damages.  

The
fact and expert discovery phases of the litigation have been completed. On September 8, 2014, P WV filed a Motion for Summary
Judgment and on October 22, 2014, the Litigants filed an opposition to such motion and on November 5, 2014, P WV filed a Reply
to NSC and WLE s opposition to such motion. On September 8, 2014, the Litigants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and
on October 22, 2014, P WV filed an opposition to such motion and on November 5, 2014, the Litigants filed a reply to P WV s
opposition to such motion. On December 16, 2014, the court held oral argument on both of the motions for Summary Judgment.  

On
April 22, 2015, the court denied P WV s motion for summary judgment and granted the Litigants  summary judgment
motion thereby dismissing all of P WV s claims. During the week of August 3, 2015, a trial was conducted on the two
remaining claims of the Litigants against P WV and Power REIT. On December 29, 2015, the Court issued a ruling with respect
to the remaining claims that were the subject of the trial. In the ruling, the Court found in favor of Power REIT on all claims
brought against it by NSC and WLE. In addition, the Court also found in favor of P WV with respect to claims brought against
P WV by WLE. However, the Court did find in favor of NSC against P WV for certain of its claims (fraud and breach of contract)
and awarded nominal damages of $1.00. In connection with NSC s demand for punitive damages, the Court ruled that NSC was
not entitled to punitive damages.  

On
January 26, 2016, Power REIT and P WV filed a Notice of Appeal to appeal the matter to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit. On April 28, 2016, Power REIT and P WV filed its appellate brief. On June 27, 2016, NSC and WLE filed
their reply brief. On August 10, 2016, Power REIT and P WV filed a reply brief at which point the appeal was fully briefed.
Power REIT and P WV have retained the firm of Keker   Van Nest LLP as lead counsel related to the appeal.  

P WV
has provided key court filings in the litigation on its website (www.pwreit.com) under a tab called  P WV Litigation
Update  which is under the  Investor Relations  tab. The provided documents and accompanying supporting documents
are not comprehensive or complete and the full case docket is available from the Public Access to Court Records (PACER) website.
Power REIT encourages interested parties to review all the public filings available on PACER and to review the risks and disclosures
in Power REIT s Annual Report filed on Form 10-k and other documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).  

POWER
REIT AND SUBSIDIARIES   

   Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, P WV incurred litigation related expenses of approximately $139,000. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, P WV incurred litigation related expenses of approximately $486,000. As of September
30, 2016, P WV had incurred a total of approximately $3.6 million of cumulative expenses related to the litigation. P WV
believes that the costs associated with the litigation are reimbursable by NSC under the Railroad Lease as additional rent, but
NSC has refused to pay such amounts. At this point, in order to collect such amounts, P WV would need to prevail on the appeal.
There can be no assurance that P WV will prevail in collecting its litigation expenses from NSC; accordingly, the expenses
of the litigation are accrued and expensed as incurred.  

As
of the date of this filing, NSC has continued to make its quarterly base rental payments ($228,750 per quarter) despite the pendency
of the litigation. However, there can be no assurance that NSC will continue to make its base rental payments.

of Morrison Cohen described herein, the independent trustees approved the hiring of Morrison Cohen as counsel, determining such
arrangement to be fair and reasonable and in the interest of the Trust.

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are those that predict

statements as statements containing the words  believe,   expect,   will,   anticipate, 
 intend,   estimate,   project,   plan,   assume  or other similar
expressions, or negatives of those expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. All
statements contained in this report regarding our future strategy, future operations, projected financial position, estimated
future revenues, projected costs, future prospects, the future of our industries and results that might be obtained by pursuing
management s current or future plans and objectives are forward-looking statements.  

You
should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because the matters they describe are subject to known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our forward-looking statements are
based on the information currently available to us and speak only as of the date of the filing of this report. New risks and uncertainties
arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these matters or how they may affect us. Over time, our actual
results, performance, financial condition or achievements may differ from the anticipated results, performance, financial condition
or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences may be significant and materially
adverse to our security holders. Our forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date hereof, and we make
no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or
subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.  

MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

Power
REIT is a Maryland-domiciled REIT that holds, develops, acquires and manages real estate assets related to transportation and
energy infrastructure in the United States. Within the transportation and energy infrastructure sectors, Power REIT is focused
on making new acquisitions of real estate that are or will be leased to renewable energy generation projects, such as utility-scale
solar farms and wind farms, that have low or minimal technology risk.  

Power
REIT is structured as a holding company and owns its assets through four wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiaries that have
been formed in order to hold real estate assets, obtain financing and generate lease revenue. Power REIT was formed as part of
a reorganization and reverse triangular merger of P WV that closed on December 2, 2011. P WV survived the reorganization
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. The Company s investment strategy, which is focused on transportation and
energy infrastructure-related real estate, builds upon its subsidiary P WV s historical ownership of railroad real estate
assets, which are currently triple-net leased to NSC.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Trust s assets consisted of approximately 112 miles of railroad infrastructure and related real
estate leased to a railway company which is owned by its subsidiary Pittsburgh   West Virginia Railroad ( P WV )
and approximately 601 acres of fee simple land leased to a number of solar power generating projects with an aggregate generating
capacity of approximately 108 MW. Power REIT is actively seeking to expand its portfolio of real estate related to renewable energy
generation projects and is pursuing investment opportunities that qualify for REIT ownership within solar, wind, hydroelectric,
geothermal, transmission and other infrastructure projects.  

Revenue
during the third quarter of 2015 and 2016 was approximately $492,000 and $492,000, respectively. Net loss attributable to Common
Shares during the third quarter of 2016 was approximately $25,000, whereas a net loss attributable to Common Shares of approximately
$256,000, was reported during the third quarter of 2015. The difference between our 2016 and 2015 third quarter results were principally
attributable to the following: an approximately $250,000 decrease in unrealized loss on interest rate swap; an approximately $21,000
increase in litigation expenses related to the NSC litigation; and, an approximately $12,000 decrease in interest expense.  

The
Trust s cash outlays, other than acquisitions and dividend payments, are for general and administrative ( G A )
expenses, which consist principally of legal and other professional fees, consultant fees, trustees  fees, NYSE MKT listing
fees, shareholder service company fees and auditing costs. During the three years ended 2015, The Trust (on a consolidated basis)
incurred substantial litigation expenses related to its ongoing litigation related to P WV (See Note 5).  

To
meet its working capital and longer-term capital needs, Power REIT relies on cash provided by its operating activities, proceeds
received from the issuance of equity securities and proceeds received from borrowings, which are typically secured by liens on
acquired assets.  

FUNDS
FROM OPERATIONS   NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

We
assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Core Funds From Operations
( Core FFO ) which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. This report contains supplemental
financial measures that are not calculated pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), including
the measure identified by us as Core FFO. Following is a definition of this measure, an explanation as to why we present it and,
at the end of this section, a reconciliation of Core FFO to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  

Core
FFO: Management believes that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure of the Company s operating performance. Management
believes that alternative measures of performance, such as net income computed under GAAP, or Funds From Operations computed in
accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), include
certain financial items that are not indicative of the results provided by the Company s asset portfolio and inappropriately
affect the comparability of the Company s period-over-period performance. These items include non-recurring expenses, such
as those incurred in connection with litigation, one-time upfront acquisition expenses that are not capitalized under ASC-805
and certain non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation expense amortization and certain up front financing costs. Therefore,
management uses Core FFO and defines it as net income excluding such items. Management believes that, for the foregoing reasons,
these adjustments to net income are appropriate. The Company believes that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing
community to employ, including when comparing the Company to other REITs that disclose similarly adjusted FFO figures, and when
analyzing changes in the Company s performance over time. Readers are cautioned that other REITs may use different adjustments
to their GAAP financial measures than we do, and that as a result, the Company s Core FFO may not be comparable to the FFO
measures used by other REITs or to other non-GAAP or GAAP financial measures used by REITs or other companies.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) of
the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
The design and operation of a control system must also reflect that there are resource constraints and management is necessarily
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls.  

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on our evaluation,
we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 were effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:   

During
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1.  L egal Proceedings.    

As
previously disclosed in its public filings with the SEC, the Trust and its wholly-owned subsidiary P WV are in litigation
with NSC and NSC s sub-lessee, Wheeling   Lake Erie Railroad ( WLE  and, together with NSC, the  Litigants )
concerning matters arising under the Railroad Lease. The case is pending in Federal trial court in Pittsburgh (the  Court ).
The Litigants initiated the litigation against the Trust and P WV in December 2011, seeking, among other things, a declaratory
judgment that NSC was not in default under the Railroad Lease.  

P WV,
as lessor, has asserted counterclaims, seeking determinations that NSC is in default under the Railroad Lease for, among other
things, failing to reimburse P WV for certain legal fees incurred by P WV, failing to permit P WV to inspect NSC s
books and records as called for under the terms of the Railroad Lease and failing to pay other amounts that P WV believes
are due and owing. P WV also seeks declarations from the Court (a) that NSC s obligation to repay the indebtedness owed
under the Railroad Lease is not indefinite in duration, and (b) that the indebtedness owed to P WV is due on demand with interest.
If P WV is successful with certain of its counterclaims, it can terminate the Railroad Lease and demand from NSC payment of
the indebtedness.  

The
indebtedness is the cumulative result of amounts received by NSC from its dispositions of P WV property, additional rental
amounts due and other sums that NSC owes to P WV but which NSC has elected, under its interpretation of the Railroad Lease,
to pay by increasing its indebtedness to P WV rather than by providing P WV with cash. According to records maintained
by NSC pursuant to the Railroad Lease and provided by NSC to P WV, as of December 31, 2012 the indebtedness owed to P WV
was approximately $16,600,000. NSC has not provided a more recent update of the indebtedness amount. P WV believes that the
indebtedness amount is understated. The indebtedness has not been included in P WV s balance sheets prepared under GAAP,
because of the dispute as to when it is due. Similarly, certain additional rental amounts that NSC disputes are due on a current
basis, and which have historically been treated as indebtedness, have not been included in P WV s income statements
or balance sheets prepared under GAAP; however, these additional rent amounts have historically been recorded as taxable income
on P WV s tax returns.  

The
Litigants have alleged that the Trust is a successor in interest in respect of the Railroad Lease. If that allegation were to
be decided against us in a fact-finding stage of the litigation, it could lead to liability and expenses. The Trust believes that
it is not a successor in interest in respect of the Railroad Lease and is not constrained by any of the Railroad Lease restrictions.  

The
parties have made certain supplements to their respective claims and counterclaims. In August 2013, P WV filed a second supplement
to its counterclaims following the Litigants  disclosure of previously undisclosed dispositions of P WV property. P WV
believes that additional amounts are owed to it as a result of these dispositions and, accordingly, asserted new counterclaims,
including claims of fraud and conversion. Based on the information available at the time P WV supplemented its claims, P WV
has estimated that the additional amounts owed to it exceed $8 million, not including potential interest and damages. P WV
also supplemented its counterclaim for additional rental amounts due in order to include the reimbursement of its legal expenses
related to the litigation. In response to P WV s second supplement to its counterclaims, in January 2014 the Litigants
amended their pleadings to add additional claims against both P WV and the Trust. The Litigants  new claims seek additional
declarations from the Court that the Litigants have not defaulted on or violated the terms of the Railroad Lease.  

On
September 13, 2013, the Trust filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all of the claims against it primarily
based on the fact that the Trust is not a party to the Lease. On January 15, 2014, the Court heard oral arguments from the parties
on the Trust s motion. On October 16, 2013, the Litigants filed a motion seeking leave to supplement their claims to include:
(i) nominal damages, (ii) enjoinment of Power REIT from taking actions in breach of the Lease Agreement, (iii) the withdrawal
of NSC s consent to the additional share by PWV; and (iv) the undoing of the reverse triangular merger. On June 19, 2014,
the court denied the Trust s motion but also denied Plaintiff s motion seeking leave to supplement their claims with
the exception of granting the motion to seek nominal damages.  

The
fact and expert discovery phases of the litigation have been completed. On September 8, 2014, P WV filed a Motion for Summary
Judgment and on October 22, 2014, the Litigants filed an opposition to such motion and on November 5, 2014, P WV filed a Reply
to NSC and WLE s opposition to such motion. On September 8, 2014, the Litigants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and
on October 22, 2014, P WV filed an opposition to such motion and on November 5, 2014, the Litigants filed a reply to P WV s
opposition to such motion. On December 16, 2014, the court held oral argument on both of the motions for Summary Judgment.  

On
April 22, 2015, the court denied P WV s motion for summary judgment and granted the Litigants  summary judgment
motion thereby dismissing all of P WV s claims. During the week of August 3, 2015, a trial was conducted on the two
remaining claims of the Litigants against P WV and Power REIT. On December 29, 2015, the Court issued a ruling with respect
to the remaining claims that were the subject of the trial. In the ruling, the Court found in favor of Power REIT on all claims
brought against it by NSC and WLE. In addition, the Court also found in favor of P WV with respect to claims brought against
P WV by WLE. However, the Court did find in favor of NSC against P WV for certain of its claims (fraud and breach of contract)
and awarded nominal damages of $1.00. In connection with NSC s demand for punitive damages, the Court ruled that NSC was
not entitled to punitive damages.  

On
January 26, 2016, Power REIT and P WV filed a Notice of Appeal to appeal the matter to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit. On April 28, 2016, Power REIT and P WV filed its appellate brief. On June 27, 2016, NSC and WLE filed
their reply brief. On August 10, 2016, Power REIT and P WV filed a reply brief at which point the appeal was fully briefed.
Power REIT and P WV have retained the firm of Keker   Van Nest LLP as lead counsel related to the appeal.  

P WV
has provided key court filings in the litigation on its website (www.pwreit.com) under a tab called  P WV Litigation
Update  which is under the  Investor Relations  tab. The provided documents and accompanying supporting documents
are not comprehensive or complete and the full case docket is available from the Public Access to Court Records (PACER) website.
Power REIT encourages interested parties to review all the public filings available on PACER and to review the risks and disclosures
in Power REIT s Annual Report filed on Form 10-k and other documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, P WV incurred litigation related expenses of approximately $139,000. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, P WV incurred litigation related expenses of approximately $486,000. As of September 30,
2016, P WV had incurred a total of approximately $3.6 million of cumulative expenses related to the litigation. P WV believes
that the costs associated with the litigation are reimbursable by NSC under the Railroad Lease as additional rent, but NSC has
refused to pay such amounts. At this point, in order to collect such amounts, P WV would need to prevail on the appeal. There
can be no assurance that P WV will prevail in collecting its litigation expenses from NSC; accordingly, the expenses of the
litigation are accrued and expensed as incurred.  

As
of the date of this filing, NSC has continued to make its quarterly base rental payments ($228,750 per quarter) despite the pendency
of the litigation. However, there can be no assurance that NSC will continue to make its base rental payments.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.    

The
Trust s results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016, which risk factors are incorporated
herein by reference. You should carefully consider these risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this
report. Should any of these risks materialize, the Trust s business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively
impacted.
