( CHOD ) is a holding company which was incorporated in Nevada on June 13, 1986. On September 30, 1987, CHOD acquired Castle Securities Corp., a New York corporation which operated as a securities broker dealer from November 1, 1985 to October 31, 2003. On April 11, 1991, CHOD formed Church Street Securities Corp., a New York corporation which operated as a securities broker dealer from October 26, 1995 to January 6, 2005.

On April 28, 2016, as a result of EMGE s failure to pay CHOD royalties due under the License Agreement, the License Agreement was terminated and rights to the Licensed Products reverted to CHOD.     Through its subsidiary SAS, the Company plans to pursue the manufacturing and marketing of the Licensed Products. The products relate to a line of stem cell nutrition and anti-aging ones which are patented and were well accepted by those familiar with these latest sectors in nutritional supplementation. The Company plans to launch these products in 2017.     Results of Operations   Year ended September 30, 2016 compared to Year ended September 30, 2015.      Sales increased $4,218 from $4,167 in 2015 to $8,385 in 2016 (all from sales of the SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray product, which was launched in the three months ended September 30, 2015).     Cost of sales decreased $383 from $1,629 in 2015 to $1,246 in 2016 (all from sales of the SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray).     Gross profit increased $4,601 from $2,538 in 2015 to $7,139 in 2016 (all from sales of the SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray). The gross profit percentage of sales in 2015 and 2016 was approximately 61% and 85%, respectively.     Total operating expenses increased $40,426 from $17,336 in 2015 to $57,762 in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting and investor relation fees incurred in 2016 compared to 2015.                  6       
      Table of Contents          Other expense   net increased $39,254 from $188,674 in 2015 to $227,928 in 2016. The impairment of investment in Emergent Health Corporation common stock increased $10,000 from $90,000 in 2015 to $100,000 in 2016. The net loss on marketable securities increased $34,387 from $117,066 in 2015 to $151,453 in 2016. For both periods, substantially all of the marketable securities were invested in Medallion Financial Group (MFIN) common stock which price per share fell from $11.66 at September 30, 2014 to $7.58 at September 30, 2015 to $4.22 at September 30, 2016.     Net loss increased $75,079 from $203,472 in 2015 to $278,551 in 2016. The increase was due to the $40,426 increase in operating expenses and the $39,254 increase in other expense-net, offset partially by the $4,601 increase in gross profit.      Liquidity and Capital Resources     At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $41,643, total assets of $275,412, total liabilities of $38,617, and total stockholders  equity of $236,795. Of the $275,412 total assets at September 30, 2016, $135,040 represents the quoted value of 32,000 shares MFIN common stock and $60,000 represents the carrying value of 2,000,000 restricted shares of Emergent Health Corporation (EMGE) common stock.     Cash and cash equivalents decreased $24,326 from $65,969 at September 30, 2015 to $41,643 at September 30, 2016. The $24,326 decrease was due primarily to the $278,551 net loss offset by the $100,000 noncash impairment of investment in EMGE common stock, the $132,058 decrease in marketable securities, and the $19,751 increase in margin liability to broker.     The Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.      We currently have no commitments with any person for any capital expenditures.     We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.                 7

ORGANIZATION      Castle Holding Corp. ( CHOD ) is a holding company which was incorporated in Nevada on June 13, 1986. The subsidiaries of CHOD are as follows:                 1.

SAS Health and Beauty Corp. (incorporated in New York May 27, 1994)   name changed from Wall Street Indians, Ltd. on March 31, 2015; manufactures and markets a skin care product called SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray.                         3.

Effective November 17, 2014, CHOD spun off all of the shares of its then wholly owned subsidiary Castle Advisors, Inc. ( CAI ) to CHOD s common stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 10, 2014. CAI, which was incorporated in New York December 23, 1993, acts as a financial consultant.      2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      Principles of consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CHOD and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.     Use of estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.     Marketable securities Marketable securities consist of trading securities valued at market. All fair value measurements are based on Level 1 inputs (i.e., closing trading prices of respective marketable securities). Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income (($149,598) and ($118,181) for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively).     Inventory   Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market (net realizable value). At September 30, 2016 and 2015, inventory consists of bottles of a skin care product called SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray and point of sales displays.                   F-7

AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    (Unaudited)        Revenue recognition   Revenues are recognized upon delivery of the products, at which time title passes to the customer, provided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is deemed probable.     Income taxes   Income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.     Net income (loss) per common share   Basic net income (loss) per common share is calculated based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive convertible preferred shares outstanding.     Recent accounting pronouncements   Certain accounting pronouncements have been issued by the FASB and other standard setting organizations which are not yet effective and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Company. The impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations from adoption of these standards is not expected to be material.      3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AT MARKET VALUE      At September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, marketable securities consist of:           On February 15, 2015, the majority stockholder and the Board of Directors approved the release of restrictions with respect to the cash and marketable securities held at CHOD accounts with TD Ameritrade Inc. and E Trade Securities LLC (see Note 7). Accordingly, we have reclassified the marketable securities included in  Restricted Cash and Securities, at Market Value  at September 30, 2014 to  Marketable Securities, at Market Value  commencing March 31, 2015.

LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH EMERGENT HEALTH CORPORATION      On November 20, 2014, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement involving a change in control of CHOD, CHOD was assigned effective January 1, 2015 the License Agreement between Cappello s, Inc, (Licensor) and EMGE (Licensee) dated August 26, 2014 (the  EMGE License Agreement ) in exchange for the issuance of 2,000,000 restricted shares of CHOD common stock. The EMGE License Agreement was valued at its estimated fair value of $30,000 based upon 2014 royalties.     The EMGE License Agreement provided for Licensee s payment of quarterly royalty payments to Licensor equal to 5% of the first $1,000,000 of annual net sales of the Licensed Products, 4% of the next $1,000,000 of annual net sales, 3% of the next $1,000,000 of annual net sales, 2% of the next $2,000,000 of annual net sales, and 1% of all additional annual net sales. The term of the EMGE License Agreement was to expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the Patent Rights. In the event the Base Sales of any one or more of the Licensed Products did not increase by 15% per year over each prior calendar year ( Underperforming Licensed Products ) and the Licensee did not pay royalties based on 15% annual increases in Base Sales for the Underperforming Licensed Product(s), Licensor could terminate the license for such Underperforming Licensed Product(s) or convert the license from an exclusive license to a non-exclusive license for such Underperforming Licensed Product(s). During the term, Licensor was to keep Licensee informed of the progress of the Patent Rights in the U.S. Patent Office and was to direct and control all aspects of the prosecution and maintenance of the Patent Rights using patent counsel of its choice; Licensee was to pay all reasonable costs and fees attributable to the Patent Rights including patent maintenance fees, government fees and attorney fees.     On June 17, 2015, pursuant to a Swenson-Emergent Loan and Security Agreement, the Company consented to EMGE s grant of a security interest in the License Agreement to a lender.      Based on the calendar year 2015 sales of the licensed products reported to CHOD by EMGE, the Company was entitled to royalties of $18,528. However, the Company collected royalties of only $572 from EMGE in 2015. Due to the uncertainty of future collections from EMGE, the Company has not recognized the remaining $17,956 royalties due at December 31, 2015.                  F-9

AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    (Unaudited)        EMGE did not report sales of the Licensed Products to CHOD in the first quarter 2016 or the second quarter 2016 and did not remit any royalties to CHOD. Due to the uncertainty of future collections from EMGE, the Company has not recognized any royalties due from EMGE for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Each share of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at any time into one share of the Company s Common Stock at the election of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stockholder. At any time, CHOD may require conversion of the Class A Convertible Preferred Shares provided that CHOD Common Stock closes at a price of $1.50 per share or higher for more than 20 consecutive business days. At any time after one year from the issue date of the Class A Convertible Preferred Shares, CHOD may require conversion of the Class A Convertible Preferred Shares provided that CHOD pay the Class A Convertible Preferred Stockholder $0.50 per Class A Convertible Preferred Share.     The Class A Convertible Preferred Shares are non-voting and have a first priority, up to $1.00 per Class A Convertible Preferred Share, in the event of liquidation of CHOD.     As a provision of the private offering, CHOD used 33% of the gross proceeds of the offering to purchase $380,000 face value of U.S. Treasury Strips (the  Strips ) maturing August 15, 2011.              CASTLE HOLDING CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    (Unaudited)        The proceeds from the Strips were available to holders of the Class A Convertible Preferred Shares and were in addition to the other assets of CHOD. The Strips, and upon maturity, subsequent investments purchased from such proceeds, were to be held by CHOD to secure payment of the investment in the Class A Convertible Preferred Shares in the event of liquidation of CHOD. The protection afforded by the Strips was to terminate upon the conversion of the Class A Convertible Preferred Shares and the Strips, or their proceeds, were to thereafter be available to CHOD.     On January 7, 2015, CHOD offered its Class A Convertible Preferred shareholders the ability to convert each one (1) share of CHOD Class A Convertible Preferred stock owned into two (2) restricted shares of restricted CHOD common stock (the  Offer ).

Accordingly, in May 2015, CHOD issued a total of 354,000 restricted shares of CHOD common stock to the 17 Class A Convertible Preferred shareholders who accepted the Offer.     The 17 accepting shareholders represented approximately 98.6% of the responding shareholders  shares and constituted a quorum. On February 15, 2015, based on the results of the Offer, the majority stockholder and Board of Directors approved the release of restrictions on the proceeds from the Strips.

INCOME TAXES       CHOD files a consolidated income tax return with its subsidiaries for federal reporting purposes. CHOD and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns for state reporting purposes.     The provisions for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of:            The Company s effective tax rate differed from the United States Federal income tax rate for the following reasons:                    CASTLE HOLDING CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    (Unaudited)      Based on management's present assessment, the Company has not yet determined it to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset of up to $405,884 attributable to the future utilization of $1,142,747 of prior year net operating loss carryforwards and $51,030 of capital loss carryforwards will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a 100% allowance against the deferred tax asset in the financial statements at September 30, 2016. The Company will continue to review this valuation allowance and make adjustments as appropriate. The net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: $180,132 in year 2021, $694,345 in year 2022, $135,943 in year 2023, $66,021 in year 2024, $39,208 in year 2025, and $27,098 in year 2036. The capital loss carryforward of $51,030 expires $49,175 in year 2018 and $1,855 in year 2021.     Current United States income tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore, the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited.      9.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      Since December 2005, the Company has been using space in Freeport New York provided by a public accounting firm owned by the Company s treasurer at no cost to the Company.              ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE       For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, Castle Holding Corp. has had no principal accountant. Accordingly, there has been no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.        ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to our company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.     MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for the Company.     Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.     Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.     A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.                  8       
      Table of Contents          Under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of September 30, 2016, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the evaluation date.     CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING     There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
