PowerVerde, Inc. and Subsidiary  

    Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

  September 30, 2016   

Note 1   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements
be read in conjunction with the Annual Report of PowerVerde, Inc. ( PowerVerde,   we,   us, 
 our,  or the  Company ) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year
or for future periods. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PowerVerde, Inc., formerly known
as Vyrex Corporation (the  Company ), and PowerVerde Systems, Inc., formerly known as PowerVerde, Inc., its wholly-owned
subsidiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Note 2   Going Concern  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has had recurring operating losses and negative
cash flows from operations. Those factors, as well as uncertainty in securing additional funds for continued operations, create
an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Nature of Business  

The Company is devoting substantially all of its present efforts
to establish a new business involving the development and commercialization of clean energy electric power generation systems,
and none of its planned principal operations have commenced. However, royalties from licenses unrelated to planned principal operations
continue to be recognized as revenue. 

Cash Equivalents  

The Company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable consist of balances due from royalties in connection
with the license agreement with VDF FutureCeuticals, Inc. The Company monitors accounts receivable and provides allowances when
considered necessary. At September 30, 2016, accounts receivable were considered to be fully collectible. Accordingly, no allowance
for doubtful accounts was provided. 

Revenue Recognition  

Royalty revenue from royalty agreements unrelated to the Company s
planned operations is recognized in accordance with the terms of the specific agreement. Revenues recognized under these agreements
amount to 100% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

4  

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for
major betterments and additions are capitalized, while replacement, maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the lives of the
respective assets, are expensed as incurred. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets (property, equipment
and intellectual property) used in operations when impairment indicators are present and the undiscounted expected cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of such assets. No impairment losses have been recognized during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

Stock-based Compensation  

The Company has accounted for stock-based compensation under the
provisions of ASC Topic 718    Stock Compensation    which requires the use of the fair-value based method
to determine compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments (stock
options and common stock purchase warrants). The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term, and the risk-free
interest rate. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of peer companies and other factors estimated over the
expected term of the stock options. The expected term of options granted is derived using the  simplified method  which
computes expected term as the average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term. The risk-free rate is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the period of the expected term. 

Common Stock Purchase Warrants  

The Company accounts for common stock purchase warrants in accordance
with ASC Topic 815- 40,  Derivatives and Hedging   Contracts in Entity s Own Equity  ( ASC 815-40 ).
Based on the provisions of ASC 815- 40, the Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or
net-share settlement, or (ii) gives the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement
or net-share settlement). The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement including
a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company, or (ii)
give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). All
outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were classified as equity. 

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  

The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 740-10,  Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s
financial statements, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This topic also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. 

Research and Development Costs  

The Company s research and development costs are expensed
in the period in which they are incurred. Such expenditures amounted to $282,339 and $192,827 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

5  

Earnings (Loss) Per Share  

Earnings (loss) per share is computed in accordance with FASB ASC
Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period.
Certain common stock equivalents were not included in the earnings (loss) per share calculation as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Warrants exercisable for  4,350,000  shares and options for 5,750,500 shares were excluded from
weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis. 

Financial instruments  

The Company carries cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable, at historical costs. The respective estimated fair values of these assets
and liabilities approximate carrying values due to their current nature. The Company also carries notes payable to related parties
at historical cost less discounts from warrants issued as loan financing costs. The fair value of such notes is significantly similar
to the face value of the notes ($400,000). 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Note 4   Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto
included in the PowerVerde, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for recent accounting pronouncements.
Other pronouncements have been issued but the Company does not believe that their adoption will have a significant impact on the
financial position or results of operations. 

Note 5   Intellectual Property   

Intellectual Property partially consists of technology acquired
from the purchase of 100% of the membership interests of Cornerstone Conservation Group LLC ( Cornerstone ) on March
30, 2012 for $659,440. Accumulated amortization with respect to this intellectual property was $659,440 at September 30, 2016. 

On June 30, 2015, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement
with VyrexIP Holdings Inc., a company owned by Company shareholder Edward Gomez, for the purchase of intellectual property. The
net price of these assets was comprised of a down payment of $16,116 and a $58,436 promissory note to the seller due July 15, 2016,
partially offset by assignment by the seller to the Company of a $38,000 promissory note due November 14, 2015, issued by the seller s
licensee Epalex Corporation, a company of which Mr. Gomez is chairman and a major stockholder. This note was paid in full as of
March 31, 2016. Accumulated amortization with respect to this intellectual property was $15,230 at September 30, 2016. 

On June 1, 2016, the Company entered into a ten year License Agreement
with Helidyne LLC to utilize the Helidyne intellectual property in the manufacturing of planetary rotor expanders and the incorporation
of same in the Company s distributed electric power generation systems. The license agreement also grants the Company an
exclusive license to sell the expanders whether manufactured by Helidyne or by the Company. The Company s royalty obligation
begins on the earlier of the commercialization of the product or three years from the effective date of the agreement. Once the
royalty obligation begins, the minimum annual royalty is $50,000 for the first six years, and $100,000 for the remainder of the
agreement. 

6  

The license acquisition fee of $100,000 is to be paid in four consecutive
monthly installments beginning June 1, 2016. This was paid in full as of September 30, 2016. The license acquisition fee is being
amortized over a ten year period. The amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $2,500. 

For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization
expense was $12,460 and $58,000 and accumulated amortization of the intangible asset- intellectual property was $677,992 at September
30, 2016. 

Future amortization of the intangible assets of intellectual property
and license agreement was as follows as of September 30, 2016:

In July 2016, a warrant for the purchase of 25,000 shares of common
stock was issued to a stockholder as additional consideration for a $25,000 loan. See Note 8. The fair market value of the warrant

Note 8 - Notes Payable to Related Parties  

Notes payable at December 31, 2015 included a $47,569 promissory
note to VyrexIP Holdings Inc. for the purchase of intellectual property. The Company agreed to pay principal plus accrued interest
over 10 monthly payments of $6,080, each due on the 15 th  day of each month, beginning October 15, 2015. This note was
paid in full, with accrued interest, in April 2016. 

Notes payable to related parties at September 30, 2016 consist of
notes payable to stockholders of $400,000 (issued in 2012), less unamortized discount of $3,215 related to common stock warrants
that had been issued to the stockholders with the notes. The discount is being amortized over the extended term of the notes, which
are due in one principal payment on December 31, 2016. Interest is payable semiannually at 10%. The note is collateralized by all
receivables now or hereafter existing pursuant to the license agreement with VDF FutureCeuticals, Inc. discussed in Note 3. 

The notes payable to related parties at September 30, 2016 also
includes a promissory note to a stockholder for $25,000. The principal balance and interest at 10% was due October 31, 2016. On
October 26, 2016, the lender extended the maturity date of the note to January 31, 2017 in exchange for an additional 25,000 warrants
with an exercise price of $0.15.

on the subject patent. 

The Company s license agreement with VDF FutureCeuticals,
Inc., which has generated all of the Company s revenues since 2012, will terminate in March 2018, when the underlying patents
expire. 

On June 1, 2016, the Company entered into a ten year License Agreement
with Helidyne LLC to utilize the Helidyne intellectual property in manufacturing and to sell Helidyne expanders. As part of the
licensing agreement the Company committed to purchase two 50 kW expanders, at a price of $25,000 each, on or before the sixth month

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward Looking Statements  

Readers are cautioned that the statements in
this Report that are not descriptions of historical facts may be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
This Report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well
as on assumptions made by and information currently available to us as of the date of this Report. When used in this Report, the
words  plan,   will,   may,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate, 
 expect,   intend,   project  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, actual actions, operations and results could differ materially
from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of the risk factors included in our 2015 Annual Report, or
other factors. We must caution, however, that this list of factors may not be exhaustive and that these or other factors, many
of which are outside of our control, could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to achieve our objectives. All
forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements set forth above. 

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The condensed consolidated financial statements
of PowerVerde, Inc. are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions
about future events that effect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Future events and their effects
cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. We believe
the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of financial
statements. 

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 

The Company follows the provisions of ASC
Topic 740-10,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process
for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This topic
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition. 

Based on our evaluation, we have concluded that
there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our
evaluation was performed for the tax years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the tax years which remain subject to
examination by major tax jurisdictions as of September 30, 2016. 

9  

We may from time to time be assessed interest
or penalties by major tax jurisdictions, although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to our financial
results. In the event we have received an assessment for interest and/or penalties, it has been classified in the condensed consolidated
financial statements as general and administrative expense. 

Revenue Recognition  

Licensing and royalty revenue from royalty agreements
unrelated to the Company s planned operations is recognized in accordance with the terms of the specific agreement. Revenues
recognized under these agreements amount to 100% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Common Stock Purchase Warrants 

The Company accounts for common stock purchase
warrants in accordance with ASC Topic 815- 40, Derivatives and Hedging   Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ( ASC
815-40 ). Based on the provisions of ASC 815- 40, the Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical
settlement or netshare settlement, or (ii) gives the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical
settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement
including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company,
or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).
All outstanding warrants as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 were classified as equity 

Intellectual Property 

The Company reviews intangible assets with finite
lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
The Company uses an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of its long-lived assets, or related group
of assets where applicable, in measuring whether the assets to be held and used will be realizable. In the event of impairment,
the Company would discount the future cash flows using its then estimated incremental borrowing rate to estimate the amount of
the impairment. 

Stock-based compensation.   

We account for stock-based compensation based
on ASC Topic 718- Stock Compensation  which requires expensing of stock options and other share-based payments based on the
fair value of each stock option awarded. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
valuation model. This model requires management to estimate the expected volatility, expected dividends, and expected term as inputs
to the valuation model. 

Overview  

From January 1991 until October 2005, the Company
devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to research and development related to its unsuccessful Biotech Business,
in particular the study of biological oxidation and antioxidation directed to the development of potential therapeutic products
for the treatment of various diseases and conditions. In the most recent years, the Company s research focused mainly on
targeted antioxidant therapeutics and nutraceuticals. The Company, has generated only limited revenue from product sales and has
relied primarily on equity financing, licensing revenues, and various debt instruments for its working capital. The Company has
been unprofitable since its inception. 

Following the cessation of material Biotech
Business operations in October 2005, the Company turned its primary focus to seeking an appropriate merger partner for its public
shell. This resulted in the February 2008 Merger with Vyrex. In March 2009, we assigned most of our Biotech intellectual property
other than our rights under existing licensing agreements (the  Biotech IP ) to an investor in exchange for his agreement
to pay all future expenses relating to the Biotech IP and to pay us 20% of any net proceeds received from future sale and/or licensing
of the Biotech IP. We do not expect this arrangement to generate material revenues. 

10  

Since the Merger, we have focused on the development,
testing and commercialization of our electric power systems, in particular, their applicability to thermal and natural gas pipeline
operations. Our business is subject to significant risks, including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts,
uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents and intense competition. See  Risk Factors.  

Except as specifically noted to the contrary,
the following discussion relates only to PowerVerde since, as a result of the Merger, the only historical financial statements
presented for the Company in periods following the Merger are those of the operating entity, PowerVerde. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015  

Since inception, we have focused on the development,
testing and commercialization of our clean energy electric power generation systems. We had no revenues from sales in the third
quarter of 2016 and 2015   but we recorded $89,118 and $122,107 in Biotech IP licensing fees (based on pre-Merger contracts),
respectively. In both years, we had substantial expenses due to our ongoing research and development activities and efforts to
commercialize our systems, as well as substantial administrative expenses associated with our status as a public company. Our research
and development expenses increased by $126,038 (243.1%) in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015, due mainly to the stock
options issued in July 2016. Our general and administrative expenses increased by $2,590 (5.0%) in the third quarter of 2016 as
compared to 2015, due mainly to increased amortization expenses for the acquisition of the Helidyne license agreement. Our net
loss was $161,590 in the third quarter of 2016, compared to net income of $4,217 in the third quarter of 2015. We expect substantial
net losses will continue until we are able to successfully commercialize and market our systems, as to which there can be no assurance. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015  

Since inception, we have focused on the development,
testing and commercialization of our clean energy electric power generation systems. We had no revenues from sales in the first
nine months of 2016 and 2015   but we recorded $417,074 and $309,703 in Biotech IP licensing fees (based on pre-Merger contracts),
respectively. In both years, we had substantial expenses due to our ongoing research and development activities and efforts to
commercialize our systems, as well as substantial administrative expenses associated with our status as a public company. Our research
and development expenses increased by $89,512 (46.4%) in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015. This increase is due
mainly to the stock options issued in July 2016. Our general and administrative expenses increased by $50,033 (23.5%) in the first
nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015, due mainly to the warrants issued in 2016. Our net loss was $173,761 in the first nine
months of 2016, a 27.3% increase from the net loss of $136,548 in the first nine months of 2015. Substantial net losses will continue
until we are able to successfully commercialize and market our systems, as to which there can be no assurance. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have financed our operations since inception
through the sale of debt and equity securities and through Biotech IP licensing revenues. As of September 30, 2016, we had a working
capital deficit of $333,732 compared to a working capital deficit of $288,544 at December 31, 2015. This decrease in working capital
is due primarily to the note payable to related parties (issued in 2012) that is due on December 31, 2016. 

We expect 2016 Biotech IP revenues to approximate
the 2015 levels; however, there can be no assurance that this revenue level will be achieved. 

We continue to seek funding from private debt
and equity investors, as we need to promptly raise substantial additional capital in order to finance our plan of operations. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary funds on commercially acceptable terms if at all. If we do not
raise the necessary funds, we may be forced to cease operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company, under the supervision and with
the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and President, evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

Management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. 

All internal controls over financial reporting,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding
of controls. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness
of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial
reporting may also fail to prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment,
our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control An Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal
control over financial reporting was effective. 

No Attestation Report  

This quarterly report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this quarterly report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no significant changes in internal
control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
