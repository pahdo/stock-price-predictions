Combined Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

1. Interim Financial Statements 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Capitalized terms and abbreviations appearing in the unaudited combined notes to condensed financial statements are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP are reflected in the condensed financial statements. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, except as otherwise disclosed. Each Registrant's Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015   is derived from that Registrant's   2015   audited Balance Sheet. The financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in each Registrant's   2015   Form 10-K. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016   or other future periods, because results for interim periods can be disproportionately influenced by various factors, developments and seasonal variations. 
    
  The classification of certain prior period amounts has been changed to conform to the presentation in the   September 30, 2016   financial statements. 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)" on the Statements of Income includes the activities of PPL Energy Supply, substantially representing PPL's former Supply segment, which was spun off and distributed to PPL shareowners on June 1, 2015. In addition, the Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   separately reports the cash flows of the discontinued operations. See Note 8 for additional information. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  The following accounting policy disclosures represent updates to Note 1 to each indicated Registrant's   2015   Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with those disclosures. 
    
  Accounts Receivable     (PPL and PPL Electric) 
    
  In accordance with a PUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative electricity suppliers at a discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts. The alternative electricity suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. The purchased accounts receivable are initially recorded at fair value using a market approach based on the purchase price paid and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PPL Electric purchased   $365 million   and   $1.0 billion   of accounts receivable from unaffiliated third parties. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , PPL Electric purchased   $361 million   and   $968 million   of accounts receivable from unaffiliated third parties. PPL Electric's purchases from PPL EnergyPlus for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   were   $146 million  . As a result of the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and creation of Talen Energy, PPL EnergyPlus (renamed Talen Energy Marketing) is no longer an affiliate of PPL Electric. PPL Electric's purchases from Talen Energy Marketing subsequent to May 31, 2015 are included as purchases from an unaffiliated third party. 
    
  Discount Rate Change for U.K. Pension Plans     (PPL) 
    
  In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD historically used a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. WPD began using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost for the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost in 2016. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , this  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

change in discount rate resulted in lower net periodic defined benefit costs recognized on PPL's Statements of Income of   $10 million   (  $8 million   after-tax or   $0.01   per share) and   $31 million   (  $25 million   after-tax or   $0.04   per share). 
    
  Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions   (PPL) 
    
  WPD's functional currency is the GBP, which is the local currency in the U.K. As such, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates on the date of consolidation and related revenues and expenses are generally translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period included in PPL's results of operations. Adjustments resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in AOCI.  
    
  Certain financial information provided for future periods in PPL s 2015 Form 10-K is impacted by the decrease in the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate that occurred subsequent to the U.K.'s vote on June 23, 2016 to withdraw from the European Union. 
    
  New Accounting Guidance Adopted     (All Registrants) 
    
  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Registrants adopted accounting guidance to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded as income tax benefit or expense on the statement of income, eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them and changes the threshold for statutory income tax withholding requirements to qualify for equity classification to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. This guidance also changes the classification of excess tax benefits to an operating activity and employee taxes paid when shares are withheld to satisfy the employer's statutory income tax withholding obligation to a financing activity on the statement of cash flows and allows entities to make a policy election to either estimate forfeitures or recognize them when they occur. The adoption of this guidance had the following impacts: 

Using the required prospective method of transition, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PPL recorded tax benefits of   $1 million   and   $12 million   (  $0.02   per share), and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , PPL Electric recorded tax benefits of   $7 million  , related to excess tax benefits for awards that were exercised and vested for the periods ending   September 30, 2016  . These amounts were recorded to Income taxes on the Statements of Income and Deferred income taxes on the Balance Sheets. The impact on LKE was not significant. 

PPL elected to use the prospective method of transition for classifying excess tax benefits as an Operating activity on the Statement of Cash Flows. The amounts classified as Financing activities in the prior periods were not significant. 

Upon adoption, using the required modified retrospective method of transition, PPL recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of   $7 million   to increase Earnings reinvested and decrease Deferred income taxes on the Balance Sheet related to prior period unrecognized excess tax benefits. 

PPL has historically presented employee taxes paid for net settled awards as a Financing activity on the Statement of Cash Flows. Therefore, there is no transition impact for this requirement. 

PPL has elected to recognize forfeitures when they occur. Due to past experience of insignificant forfeitures, there is no transition impact of this policy election.

4. Earnings Per Share 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by incremental shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares as calculated using the Treasury Stock Method. Incremental non-participating securities that have a dilutive impact are detailed in the table below. 
    
  Reconciliations of the amounts of income and shares of PPL common stock (in thousands) for the periods ended   September 30   used in the EPS calculation are:

  Reconciliations of income taxes for the periods ended   September 30   are as follows. 

(a) 
    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, PPL recorded a $  9 million   tax benefit related to a planned amendment of a prior period tax return. 
       
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , PPL recorded a $  12 million   tax benefit to adjust the settled refund amount approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation for the open audit years 1998 - 2011. 
           (b) 
    The U.K. Finance Act 2016, enacted in September 2016, reduces the U.K. statutory income tax rate effective April 1, 2020 from   18%   to   17%  .  As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (c) 
    During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PPL recorded lower income tax expense related to the application of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. See Note 2 for additional information.

     Table of Contents  

On November 1, 2016, LG E and KU announced that on November 23, 2016, they anticipate filing requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $103 million at KU and an increase in annual base electricity and gas rates of approximately $94 million and $14 million at LG E. The proposed base rate increases to be requested are an electricity rate increase of 6.4% at KU and electricity and gas rate increases of 8.5% and 4.2% at LG E and would become effective in July 2017. LG E's and KU's applications include requests for CPCNs for implementing an Advanced Metering System program and a Distribution Automation program. The applications are to be based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 and a requested return-on-equity of 10.23%. LG E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.     
    
  CPCN and ECR Filings     (PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  On August 8, 2016, the KPSC issued an order approving CPCNs and ECR rate treatment regarding environmental construction projects relating to the EPA's regulations addressing the handling of coal combustion by-products and MATS. The construction projects began in   2016   and are expected to continue through 2023. The KPSC order established a   9.8%   authorized return on equity for these projects. Recovery of costs has commenced with bills rendered on and after August 31, 2016.  
    
  Gas Franchise     (LKE and LG E) 
    
  LG E s existing gas franchise agreement for the Louisville/Jefferson County service area expired on March 31, 2016. LG E submitted a proposed bid for a new franchise agreement on June 9, 2016. On August 30, 2016, LG E and Louisville/Jefferson County entered into a revised franchise agreement with a   5  -year term (with renewal options). The franchise fee may be modified at Louisville/Jefferson County's election upon   60   days' notice. However, any franchise fee is capped at   3%   of gross receipts for natural gas service within the franchise area. The agreement further provides that if the KPSC determines that the franchise fee should be recovered from LG E's customers, the franchise fee shall revert to zero. On August 30, 2016, LG E filed an application in a KPSC proceeding to review and rule upon the recoverability of the franchise fee. 
    
  Louisville/Jefferson County submitted a motion to dismiss the proceeding filed by LG E, and further filed a KPSC complaint against LG E relating to these issues. On October 19, 2016, the KPSC issued an order rejecting Louisville/Jefferson County's complaint and provided Louisville/Jefferson County   20   days to file an amended complaint. Until the KPSC issues orders in these proceedings, LG E cannot predict the outcome of this matter but does not anticipate that it will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operation. LG E continues to provide gas service to customers in this franchise area at existing rates, but without collecting or remitting a franchise fee. 
    
  Pennsylvania Activities     (  PPL and PPL Electric  ) 
    
  Act 129 
    
  Act 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) to meet, by specified dates, specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. EDCs not meeting the requirements of Act 129 are subject to significant penalties. In November 2015, PPL Electric filed with the PUC its Act 129 Phase III Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan for the period June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021. In January 2016, PPL Electric and the other parties to the case reached a settlement of all major issues and filed that settlement with the Administrative Law Judge. In June 2016, the PUC issued a final order approving PPL Electric's Phase III Plan as modified by the settlement, allowing PPL Electric to recover, through the Act 129 compliance rider, a maximum   $313 million   in program cost over the   five  -year period June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021.      
    
  Act 129 also requires Default Service Providers (DSP) to provide electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PUC-approved default service procurement plan through auctions, requests for proposal and bilateral contracts at the sole discretion of the DSP. Act 129 requires a mix of spot market purchases, short-term contracts and long-term contracts (  4   to   20 years  ), with long-term contracts limited to   25%   of load unless otherwise approved by the PUC. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan. 
    
  PPL Electric has received PUC approval of its biannual DSP procurement plans for all prior periods required under Act 129. In January 2016, PPL Electric filed a Petition for Approval of a new DSP procurement plan with the PUC for the period June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2021. The parties to the proceeding reached a settlement on all but one issue and a partial settlement agreement and briefs on the open issue were submitted to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in July 2016. In August 2016, the ALJ issued an initial decision, and certain parties filed exceptions and reply exceptions. In October 2016, the PUC issued an order approving the partial settlement agreement and adopting the initial decision with minor modifications.

  Discontinued Operations 
    
  Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply 
    
  In June 2015, PPL completed the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, which combined its competitive power generation businesses with those of Riverstone to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. 

44 

     Table of Contents  

Following completion of the spinoff, PPL shareowners owned   65%   of Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone owned   35%  . The spinoff had no effect on the number of PPL common shares owned by PPL shareowners or the number of shares of PPL common stock outstanding. The transaction is intended to be tax-free to PPL and its shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
    
  PPL has no continuing ownership interest in or control of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly PPL Energy Supply). See Note 8 in PPL's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information. 
    
  Loss on Spinoff 
    
  In   June 2015  , in conjunction with the accounting for the spinoff, PPL evaluated whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than the carrying value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff date. 
    
  PPL considered several valuation methodologies to derive a fair value estimate of its Supply segment at the spinoff date. These methodologies included considering the closing "when-issued" Talen Energy market value on June 1, 2015 (the spinoff date), adjusted for the proportional share of the equity value attributable to the Supply segment, as well as, the valuation methods consistently used in PPL's goodwill impairment assessments - an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis of the Supply segment and an alternative market approach considering market multiples of comparable companies. 
    
  Although the Talen Energy market value approach utilized the most observable inputs of the   three   approaches, PPL considered certain limitations of the "when-issued" trading market for the spinoff transaction including the short trading duration, lack of liquidity in the market and anticipated initial Talen stock ownership base selling pressure, among other factors, and concluded that these factors limited this input being solely determinative of the fair value of the Supply segment. As such, PPL also considered the other valuation approaches in estimating the overall fair value, but ultimately assigned the highest weighting to the Talen Energy market value approach. 
    
  The following table summarizes PPL's fair value analysis:

      Estimated Fair Value

A key assumption included in the fair value estimate is the application of a control premium of   25%   in the   two   market approaches. PPL concluded it was appropriate to apply a control premium in these approaches as the goodwill impairment testing guidance was followed in determining the estimated fair value of the Supply segment which had historically been a reporting unit for PPL. This guidance provides that the market price of an individual security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit. This guidance also indicates that substantial value may arise to a controlling shareholder from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that arise from control over another entity, and that the market price of a company's individual share of stock does not reflect this additional value to a controlling shareholder. Therefore, the quoted market price need not be the sole measurement basis for determining the fair value, and including a control premium is appropriate in measuring the fair value of a reporting unit. 
    
  In determining the control premium, PPL reviewed premiums received during the prior   five years   in market sales transactions obtained from observable independent power producer and hybrid utility transactions greater than   $1 billion  . Premiums for these transactions ranged from   5%   to   42%   with a median of approximately   25%  . Given these metrics, PPL concluded a control premium of   25%   to be reasonable for both of the market valuation approaches used.  
    
  Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included forward energy prices, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the Energy Supply portion of the Talen Energy business planning process at that time and a market participant discount rate. 

45 

     Table of Contents  

Using these methodologies and weightings, PPL determined the estimated fair value of the Supply segment (classified as Level 3) was below its carrying value of   $4.1 billion   and recorded a loss on the spinoff of   $879 million   in the second quarter of 2015, which is reflected in discontinued operations and is nondeductible for tax purposes. This amount served to reduce the basis of the net assets accounted for as a dividend at the June 1, 2015 spinoff date. 
    
  Costs of Spinoff 
    
  Employee-related costs incurred in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily included accelerated stock-based compensation and pro-rated performance-based cash incentive and stock-based compensation awards, primarily for PPL Energy Supply employees and for PPL Services employees who became PPL Energy Supply employees in connection with the transaction. PPL Energy Supply recognized   $24 million   of these costs at the spinoff closing date, which are reflected in discontinued operations. 
    
  PPL also recorded   $44 million   of third-party costs related to this transaction during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Of these costs,   $31 million   were primarily for bank advisory, legal and accounting fees to facilitate the transaction, and are reflected in discontinued operations. An additional   $13 million   of consulting and other costs were incurred to prepare the new Talen Energy organization for the spinoff and reconfigure the remaining PPL service functions. These costs are primarily recorded in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statement of Income. 
    
  At the close of the transaction,   $72 million   (  $42 million   after-tax) of cash flow hedges, primarily unamortized losses on PPL interest rate swaps recorded in AOCI and designated as cash flow hedges of PPL Energy Supply's future interest payments, were reclassified into earnings and are reflected in discontinued operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Continuing Involvement     (PPL and PPL Electric) 
    
  As a result of the spinoff, PPL and PPL Energy Supply entered into a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) that terminates no later than   two years   after the spinoff. Pursuant to the TSA, PPL is providing Talen Energy certain information technology, financial and accounting, human resource and other specified services. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amounts PPL billed Talen Energy for these services were   $9 million   and   $29 million  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the amounts PPL billed Talen Energy for these services were   $11 million   and   $14 million  . In general, the fees for the transition services allow the provider to recover its cost of the services, including overheads, but without margin or profit. 
    
  Additionally, prior to the spinoff, through the annual competitive solicitation process, PPL EnergyPlus was awarded supply contracts for a portion of the PLR generation supply for PPL Electric, which were retained by Talen Energy Marketing as part of the spinoff. PPL Electric's supply contracts with Talen Energy Marketing extend through November 2016. Energy purchases from PPL EnergyPlus were previously included in PPL Electric's Statements of Income as "Energy purchases from affiliate" but were eliminated in PPL's Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PPL Electric's energy purchases from Talen Energy Marketing were   $15 million   and   $98 million  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , PPL Electric's energy purchases from Talen Energy Marketing were not significant. These energy purchases are no longer considered affiliate transactions.

  Regional Transmission Line Expansion Plan     (PPL and PPL Electric) 
    
  Northeast/Pocono 
    
  In October 2012, the FERC issued an order in response to PPL Electric's December 2011 request for ratemaking incentives for the Northeast/Pocono Reliability project (a new   58  -mile,   230   kV transmission line that includes   three   new substations and upgrades to adjacent facilities). The FERC granted the incentive for inclusion in rate base of all prudently incurred construction work in progress costs but denied the requested incentive for a   100   basis point adder to the return on equity. 
    
  In December 2012, PPL Electric submitted an application to the PUC requesting permission to site and construct the project. In January 2014, the PUC issued a final order approving the application. The line was energized in April 2016, completing the approximately   $350 million   project which includes additional substation security enhancements. Costs related to the project are included on the Balance Sheets, primarily in "Regulated utility plant." 

9. Defined Benefits 
    
  (PPL, LKE and LG E) 
    
  Certain net periodic defined benefit costs are applied to accounts that are further distributed among capital, expense and regulatory assets, including certain costs allocated to applicable subsidiaries for plans sponsored by PPL Services and LKE. Following are the net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) of the plans sponsored by PPL and its subsidiaries, LKE and its subsidiaries and LG E for the periods ended   September 30  :

    For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the total net periodic defined benefit cost includes   $18 million   reflected in discontinued operations related to costs allocated from PPL's plans to PPL Energy Supply prior to the spinoff. 

(PPL Electric, LG E and KU) 
    
  In addition to the specific plans it sponsors, LG E is allocated costs of defined benefit plans sponsored by LKE. PPL Electric and KU do not directly sponsor any defined benefit plans. PPL Electric is allocated costs of defined benefit plans sponsored by PPL Services and KU is allocated costs of defined benefit plans sponsored by LKE. These allocations are based on participation in those plans, which management believes are reasonable. For the periods ended   September 30  , PPL Services allocated the following net periodic defined benefit costs to PPL Electric, and LKE allocated the following net periodic defined benefit costs to LG E and KU:

  Cane Run Environmental Claims     (PPL, LKE and LG E) 
    
  In December 2013,   six   residents, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against LG E and PPL in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and RCRA. In addition, these plaintiffs assert common law claims of nuisance, trespass and negligence. These plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and civil penalties, plus costs and attorney fees, for the alleged statutory violations. Under the common law claims, these plaintiffs seek monetary compensation and punitive damages for property damage and diminished property values for a class consisting of residents within   four   miles of the Cane Run plant. In their individual capacities, these plaintiffs seek compensation for alleged adverse health effects. In response to a motion to dismiss filed by PPL and LG E, in July 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' RCRA claims and all but   one   Clean Air Act claim, but declined to dismiss their common law tort claims. Upon motion of LG E and PPL, the district court certified for appellate review the issue of whether the state common law claims are preempted by federal statute. In December 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order granting appellate review regarding the above matter. Oral argument before the Sixth Circuit was held in August 2015. In November 2015, the Sixth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Court's ruling that plaintiffs' state law claims are not preempted by the Clean Air Act and remanding the matter to the District Court for further proceedings. The District Court has issued an order setting a discovery schedule through the second quarter of 2017. PPL, LKE and LG E cannot predict the outcome of this matter. LG E retired   one   coal-fired unit at the Cane Run plant in March 2015 and the remaining   two   coal-fired units at the plant in June 2015.  
    
  Mill Creek Environmental Claims     (PPL, LKE and LG E) 
    
  In May 2014, the Sierra Club filed a citizen suit against LG E in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act. The Sierra Club alleged that various discharges at the Mill Creek plant constituted violations of the plant's water discharge permit. The Sierra Club sought civil penalties, injunctive relief, costs and attorney's fees.  The parties reached a proposed settlement in the matter on September 27, 2016, which has been submitted to  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

the court. LG E has agreed to limited alterations to outfall facilities and discharge practices and to fund   $1 million   in environmental enhancement projects focused on tree planting and water quality in Kentucky. The settlement includes no finding or agreement of any violation of law by LG E and does not involve fines or civil penalties. The U.S. Department of Justice has 45 days to review the settlement before the court can approve. PPL, LKE and LG E cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, but do not presently expect the matter to have a material effect on plant operation, capital expenditures or operating costs, or to result in significant charges beyond the amounts previously recorded.  
    
  E.W. Brown Environmental Claims     (  PPL, LKE and KU) 
    
  In October 2015, KU received a notice of intent from Earthjustice and the Sierra Club informing certain federal and state agencies of the Sierra Club's intent to file a citizen suit, following expiration of the mandatory   60  -day notification period, for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act. The claimants allege discharges at the E.W. Brown plant in violation of applicable rules and the plant's water discharge permit. The claimants assert that, unless the alleged discharges are promptly brought into compliance, it intends to seek civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees. In November 2015, the claimants submitted an amended notice of intent to add the Kentucky Waterways Alliance as a claimant. On October 26, 2016, the claimants submitted an additional notice of intent alleging management of waste in a manner that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment under the RCRA. PPL, LKE and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on the operations of the E. W. Brown plant, including increased capital or operating costs, if any. 
    
  (PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  Trimble County Unit 2 Air Permit 
    
  The Sierra Club and other environmental groups petitioned the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to overturn the air permit issued for the Trimble County Unit 2 baseload coal-fired generating unit, but the agency upheld the permit in an order issued in September 2007. In response to subsequent petitions by environmental groups, the EPA ordered certain non-material changes to the permit which, in January 2010, were incorporated into a final revised permit issued by the Kentucky Division for Air Quality. In March 2010, the environmental groups petitioned the EPA to object to the revised state permit. Until the EPA issues a final ruling on the pending petition and all available appeals are exhausted, PPL, LKE, LG E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on the operations of the Trimble County plant, including increased capital or operating costs, if any. 
    
  Trimble County Water Discharge Permit 
    
  In May 2010, the Kentucky Waterways Alliance and other environmental groups filed a petition with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC) challenging the Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued in April 2010, which covers water discharges from the Trimble County plant. In November 2010, the KEEC issued a final order upholding the permit, which was subsequently appealed by the environmental groups. In September 2013, the Franklin Circuit Court reversed the KEEC order upholding the permit and remanded the permit to the agency for further proceedings. LG E and the KEEC appealed the order to the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In July 2015, the Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling. On February 10, 2016, the Kentucky Supreme Court issued an order granting discretionary review and oral arguments were held on September 14, 2016. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on the operations of the Trimble County plant, including increased capital or operating costs, if any. 
    
  Regulatory Issues     (  All Registrants) 
    
  See Note 6 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation. 
    
  Electricity - Reliability Standards 
    
  The NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk electric system in North America. The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards. 
    
  The Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk electric system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties for certain violations. 

50 

     Table of Contents  

LG E, KU and PPL Electric monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and self-report or self-log potential violations of applicable reliability requirements whenever identified, and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Penalties incurred to date have not been significant. Any Regional Reliability Entity (including RFC or SERC) determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC. 
    
  In the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time. The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Due to the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify, curtail, replace or cease operation of certain facilities or performance of certain operations to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition, legal challenges to new environmental permits or rules add to the uncertainty of estimating the future cost of these permits and rules. 
    
  WPD's distribution businesses are subject to certain statutory and regulatory environmental requirements. In connection with the matters discussed below, it may be necessary for WPD to incur significant compliance costs, which costs may be recoverable through rates subject to the approval of Ofgem. PPL believes that WPD has taken and continues to take measures to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
    
  LG E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and those federal, state, or local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from facilities that generate electricity from coal in accordance with approved compliance plans. Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LG E and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery before the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable. Because neither WPD nor PPL Electric owns any generating plants, their exposure to related environmental compliance costs is reduced. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. 
    
  Air 
    
  (PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  The Clean Air Act, which regulates air pollutants from mobile and stationary sources in the United States, has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically to review and establish concentration levels in the ambient air for   six   criteria pollutants to protect public health and welfare. These concentration levels are known as NAAQS. The six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. 
    
  Federal environmental regulation of these criteria pollutants require states to adopt implementation plans, known as state implementation plans, for certain pollutants, which detail how the state will attain the standards that are mandated by the relevant law or regulation. Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (non-attainment areas), and must develop a state implementation plan both to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and to maintain good air quality in attainment areas. In addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, states in the eastern portion of the country, including Kentucky, are subject to a regional program developed by the EPA known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The NAAQS, future revisions to the NAAQS and state implementation plans, or future revisions to regional programs, may require installation of additional pollution controls, the costs of which PPL, LKE, LG E and KU believe are subject to cost recovery. 
    
  Although PPL, LKE, LG E and KU do not anticipate significant costs to comply with these programs, changes in market or operating conditions could result in different costs than anticipated. 
    
  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) 
    
  Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to reassess the NAAQS for certain air pollutants on a five-year schedule. In 2008, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone and proposed to further strengthen the standard in November 2014. The EPA released a  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

new ozone standard on October 1, 2015. The states and EPA will determine attainment with the new ozone standard through review of relevant ambient air monitoring data, with attainment or nonattainment designations scheduled no later than October 2017. States are also obligated to address interstate transport issues associated with new ozone standards through the establishment of "good neighbor" state implementation plans for those states that are found to contribute significantly to another state's non-attainment. States that are not in the ozone transport region, including Kentucky, are working together to evaluate further nitrogen oxide reductions from fossil-fueled plants with SCRs. The nature and timing of any additional reductions resulting from these evaluations cannot be predicted at this time. 
    
  In 2010, the EPA finalized revised NAAQS for sulfur dioxide and required states to identify areas that meet those standards and areas that are in "non-attainment". In July 2013, the EPA finalized non-attainment designations for parts of the country, including part of Jefferson County in Kentucky. Attainment must be achieved by 2018. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU anticipate that certain previously required compliance measures, such as upgraded or new sulfur dioxide Scrubbers at certain plants and the retirement of coal-fired generating units at LG E's Cane Run plant and KU's Green River plant, will help to achieve compliance with the new sulfur dioxide and ozone standards. If additional reductions are required, the costs could be significant. 
    
  Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) 
    
  In February 2012, the EPA finalized the MATS rule requiring reductions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossil-fuel fired power plants, with an effective date of April 16, 2012. The MATS rule was challenged by industry groups and states and was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit Court (D.C. Circuit Court) in April 2014. A group of states subsequently petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court (Supreme Court) to review this decision and, in June 2015, the Supreme Court held that the EPA failed to properly consider costs when deciding to regulate hazardous air emissions from power plants under MATS. The Supreme Court remanded the matter to the D.C. Circuit Court, which in December 2015 remanded the rule to the EPA without vacating it. The EPA has proposed a supplemental finding regarding costs of the rule and has announced that it intends to make a final determination in 2016. The EPA's MATS rule remains in effect during the pendency of the ongoing proceedings. 
    
  LG E and KU have installed significant controls in response to the MATS rule and in conjunction with compliance with other environmental requirements, including fabric-filter baghouses, upgraded Scrubbers or chemical additive systems for which appropriate KPSC authorization and/or ECR treatment has been received. LG E and KU have received KPSC approval for a compliance plan providing for installation of additional MATS-related controls; however, the estimated cost of these controls is not expected to be significant for either LG E or KU. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the MATS rule or its potential impact, if any, on plant operations, rate treatment or future capital or operating needs. See Note 6 for additional information. 
    
  New Source Review (NSR) 
    
  The NSR litigation brought by the EPA, states and environmental groups against coal-fired generating plants in past years continues to proceed through the courts. Although none of this litigation directly involves PPL, LKE, LG E or KU, it can influence the permitting of large capital projects at LG E's and KU's power plants, the costs of which cannot presently be determined but could be significant. 
    
  Climate Change 
    
  There is continuing world-wide attention focused on issues related to climate change. In June 2016, the President announced that the United States, Canada and Mexico have established the North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership Plan which specifies actions to promote clean energy, address climate change and protect the environment. The plan includes a goal to provide 50% of the energy used in North America from clean energy sources by 2025.  The plan does not impose any nation-specific requirements.  
    
  In December 2015,   195   nations, including the U.S., signed the Paris Agreement on Climate which establishes a comprehensive framework for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both developed and developing nations. Although the agreement does not establish binding reduction requirements, it requires each nation to prepare, communicate and maintain GHG reduction commitments. Reductions can be achieved in a variety of ways, including energy conservation, power plant efficiency improvements, reduced utilization of coal-fired generation or replacing coal-fired generation with natural gas or renewable generation. Based on EPA's Clean Power Plan described below, the U.S. has committed to an initial reduction target of   26%   to   28%   below 2005 levels by 2025.  

52 

     Table of Contents  

The U.K. has enacted binding carbon reduction requirements that are applicable to WPD. Under the U.K. law, WPD must purchase carbon allowances to offset emissions associated with WPD s operations. The cost of these allowances is included in WPD s current operating expenses. WPD expects these expenses to decrease as a result of energy efficiency measures and the removal of   18   fuel sources previously included in the allowance requirements. 
       
  The EPA's Rules under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act 
    
  As further described below, the EPA finalized rules imposing GHG emission standards for both new and existing power plants in the United States. The EPA has also issued a proposed federal implementation plan that would apply to any states that fail to submit an acceptable state implementation plan under these rules. The EPA's authority to promulgate these regulations under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court by several states and industry groups. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the rule for existing plants (the Clean Power Plan) pending the D.C. Circuit Court's review and subsequent review by the Supreme Court if a writ of certiorari is filed and granted. 
    
  The EPA's rule for new power plants imposes separate emission standards for coal and natural gas units based on the application of different technologies. The coal standard is based on the application of partial carbon capture and sequestration technology, but because this technology is not presently commercially viable, the rule effectively precludes the construction of new coal-fired plants. The standard for NGCC power plants is the same as the EPA proposed in 2012 and is not continuously achievable. The preclusion of new coal-fired plants and the compliance difficulties posed for new natural gas-fired plants could have a significant industry-wide impact. 
    
  The EPA's Clean Power Plan 
    
  The EPA's rule for existing power plants, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, was published in the Federal Register in October 2015. The Clean Power Plan contains state-specific rate-based and mass-based reduction goals and guidelines for the development, submission and implementation of state implementation plans to achieve the state goals. State-specific goals were calculated from 2012 data by applying the EPA's broad interpretation and definition of the BSER, resulting in the most stringent targets to be met in 2030, with interim targets to be met beginning in 2022. The EPA believes it has offered some flexibility to the states as to how their compliance plans can be crafted, including the option to use a rate-based approach (limit emissions per megawatt hour) or a mass-based approach (limit total tons of emissions per year), and the option to demonstrate compliance through emissions trading and multi-state collaborations. Under the rate-based approach, Kentucky would need to make a   41%   reduction from its 2012 emissions rate and under a mass-based approach it would need to make a   36%   reduction. These reductions are significantly greater than initially proposed and present significant challenges to the state. If the Clean Power Plan is ultimately upheld and Kentucky fails to develop an approvable implementation plan by the applicable deadline, the EPA would impose a federal implementation plan that could be more stringent than what the state plan might provide. Depending on the provisions of the Kentucky implementation plan, LG E and KU may need to modify their current portfolio of generating assets during the next decade and/or participate in an allowance trading program. 
    
  LG E and KU are participating in the ongoing regulatory processes at the state and federal level. Various states, industry groups and individual companies including LKE have filed petitions for reconsideration with EPA and petitions for review with the D.C. Circuit Court challenging the Clean Power Plan. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule pending the D.C. Circuit Court's review. A ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court may occur in late 2016 or in early 2017. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact, if any, on plant operations, or future capital or operating costs. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU believe that the costs, which could be significant, would be subject to rate recovery. 
    
  In April 2014, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation limiting the measures that the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet may consider in setting performance standards to comply with the EPA's regulations governing GHG emissions from existing sources. The legislation provides that such state GHG performance standards shall be based on emission reductions, efficiency measures and other improvements available at each power plant, rather than renewable energy, end-use energy efficiency, fuel switching and re-dispatch. These statutory restrictions may make it more difficult for Kentucky to achieve the GHG reduction levels that the EPA has established for Kentucky. 
    
  Sulfuric Acid Mist Emissions   (PPL, LKE and LG E) 
    
  In June 2016, the EPA issued a notice of violation under the Clean Air Act alleging that LG E violated applicable rules relating to sulfuric acid mist emissions at its Mill Creek plant. The notice alleges failure to install proper controls, failure to operate the facility consistent with good air pollution control practice, and causing emissions exceeding applicable requirements or constituting a nuisance or endangerment. LG E believes it has complied with applicable regulations during the relevant time period. Discussions between the EPA and LG E are ongoing. PPL, LKE and LG E are unable to predict the outcome of this

     Table of Contents  

matter or the potential impact on operations of the Mill Creek plant, including increased capital or operating costs, and potential civil penalties or remedial measures, if any. 
    
  Water/Waste 
    
  (PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) 
    
  In April 2015, the EPA published its final rule regulating CCRs. CCRs include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes. The rule became effective in October 2015. It imposes extensive new requirements, including location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements on CCR impoundments and landfills that are located on active power plants in the United States and not closed. Under the rule, the EPA will regulate CCRs as non-hazardous under Subtitle D of RCRA and allow beneficial use of CCRs, with some restrictions. The rule's requirements for covered CCR impoundments and landfills include implementation of groundwater monitoring and commencement or completion of closure activities generally between three and ten years from certain triggering events. This self-implementing rule requires posting of compliance documentation on a publicly accessible website and is enforceable solely through citizen suits. LG E and KU are also subject to state rules applicable to CCR management which may potentially be modified to reflect some or all requirements of the federal rule. Industry groups, environmental groups, individual companies and others have filed legal challenges to the final rule which are pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    
  LG E and KU have received KPSC approval for a compliance plan providing for construction of additional landfill capacity at the Brown Station, closure of impoundments at the Mill Creek, Trimble County, Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition to the foregoing measures required for compliance with federal CCR rule requirements, LG E and KU also received KPSC approval for their plans to close impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law requirements. See Note 6 for additional information. 
    
  In connection with the final CCR rule, LG E and KU recorded adjustments to existing AROs during 2015 and 2016. See Note 16 for additional information. Further changes to AROs, current capital plans or operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results, and regulatory or legal proceedings. Costs relating to this rule are subject to rate recovery. 
    
  Clean Water Act 
    
  Regulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for facilities and construction projects in the United States. Many of those requirements relate to power plant operations, including requirements related to the treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, standards intended to protect aquatic organisms by reducing capture in the screens attached to cooling water intake structures (impingement) at generating facilities and the water volume brought into the facilities (entrainment). The requirements could impose significant costs for LG E and KU which are subject to rate recovery. 
    
  Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELGs) 
    
  In September 2015, the EPA released its final effluent limitations guidelines for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electricity generating facilities. The rule provides strict technology-based discharge limitations for control of pollutants in scrubber wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water, mercury control wastewater, gasification wastewater and combustion residual leachate. The new guidelines require deployment of additional control technologies providing physical, chemical and biological treatment of wastewaters. The guidelines also mandate operational changes including "no discharge" requirements for fly ash and bottom ash transport waters and mercury control wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations will be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis according to criteria provided by the EPA, but the requirements of the rule must be fully implemented no later than 2023. It has not been decided how Kentucky intends to integrate the ELGs into its routine permit renewal process. Industry groups, environmental groups, individual companies and others have filed legal challenges to the final rule which have been consolidated before the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. LG E and KU are developing compliance strategies and schedules. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU are unable to fully estimate compliance costs or timing at this time, although certain preliminary estimates are included in current  
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

capital forecasts for applicable periods. Costs to comply with ELGs or other discharge limits, which are expected to be significant, are subject to rate recovery. 
    
  Clean Water Act Section 316(b) 
    
  The EPA's final 316(b) rule for existing facilities became effective in October 2014, and regulates cooling water intake structures and their impact on aquatic organisms. States are allowed broad discretion to make site-specific determinations under the rule. The rule requires existing facilities to choose between several options to reduce the impact to aquatic organisms that become trapped against water intake screens (impingement) and to determine the intake structure's impact on aquatic organisms pulled through a plant's cooling water system (entrainment). Plants equipped with closed-cycle cooling, an acceptable option, would likely not incur substantial costs. Once-through systems would likely require additional technology to comply with the rule. Based on studies conducted by LG E and KU to date, all plants will incur only insignificant operational costs. In addition, LG E's Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to incur capital costs. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU are evaluating compliance strategies but do not presently expect the compliance costs, which are subject to rate recovery, to be significant.

  Waters of the United States (WOTUS) 
    
  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has issued a stay of EPA's rule on the definition of WOTUS pending the court's review of the rule. The effect of the stay is that the WOTUS rule is not in effect anywhere in the United States. The ultimate outcome of the court's review of the rule remains uncertain. Because of the strict permitting programs already in place in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the Registrants do not expect the rule to have a significant impact on their operations. 
    
  Other Issues 
    
  The EPA is reassessing its polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) regulations under the Toxic Substance Control Act, which was significantly updated in June 2016. In 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for changes to these regulations. The rulemaking, which could lead to a phase-out in the United States of all or some equipment containing PCBs, is not likely to be affected by the revisions to the Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA has postponed the release of revisions to its proposed rulemaking. The Registrants cannot predict at this time the outcome of the proposed EPA rulemaking and what impact, if any, it would have on their facilities, but the costs could be significant.  
    
  Superfund and Other Remediation     (All Registrants) 
    
  PPL Electric is potentially responsible for a share of the costs at several sites listed by the EPA under the federal Superfund program, including the Columbia Gas Plant site and the Brodhead site. Clean-up actions have been or are being undertaken at all of these sites, the costs of which have not been significant to PPL Electric. Should the EPA require different or additional measures in the future, however, or should PPL Electric's share of costs at multi-party sites increase substantially more than expected, the costs could be significant. 
    
  PPL Electric, LG E and KU are investigating, responding to agency inquiries, remediating, or have completed the remediation of, several sites that were not addressed under a regulatory program such as Superfund, but for which PPL Electric, LG E and KU may be liable for remediation. These include a number of former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Kentucky previously owned or operated or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of PPL Electric, LG E and KU. To date, the costs of these sites have not been significant. 
    
  There are additional sites, formerly owned or operated by PPL Electric, LG E and KU predecessors or affiliates. LG E and KU lack information on the condition of such additional sites and are therefore unable to estimate any potential liability they may have or a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these sites. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, PPL Electric had a recorded liability of   $10 million   representing its best estimate of the probable loss incurred to remediate additional sites previously owned or operated by PPL Electric predecessors or affiliates. Depending on the outcome of investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or been completed, or developments at sites for which information is incomplete, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be significant and may be as much as approximately   $30 million  . 
    
  The EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing. As a result of the EPA's evaluation, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup. This could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former

coal gas manufacturing plants. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters. 
    
  From time to time, PPL's subsidiaries in the United States undertake remedial action in response to notices of violations, spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary for compliance with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations. Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of PPL Electric, LG E and KU. 
    
  Future cleanup or remediation work at sites under review, or at sites not yet identified, may result in significant additional costs for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU. Insurance policies maintained by LKE, LG E and KU may be applicable to certain of the costs or other obligations related to these matters but the amount of insurance coverage or reimbursement cannot be estimated or assured. 
    
  European Union Creosote Ban     (PPL) 
    
  In 2011, the European Commission amended the European Union Biocides Directive to ban the use of creosote in contact with soil. Creosote is a wood preservative used to extend the life of wooden poles that support power lines. Although European Union member countries were required to pass implementing laws by 2012, the U.K. has not passed an implementing law and there are no legal penalties for failing to do so. The recent U.K. referendum in favor of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union further reduces the likelihood that the U.K. will implement the European Union directive. In the unlikely event that the U.K. were to ban the use of creosote, WPD's creosote-treated wood poles would need to be replaced with an acceptable alternative at the time of routine replacement. Although the aggregate cost to replace poles could be significant, it would be incurred as poles are replaced in the ordinary course and would be subject to rate recovery. WPD has   1.4 million   wood poles in its system. There are currently no alternative wood preservatives available that are acceptable to the industry and/or regulators.    
    
  Other 
    
  Guarantees and Other Assurances 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example, guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage. 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  PPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities of PPL Capital Funding. 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  The table below details guarantees provided as of   September 30, 2016  . "Exposure" represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee. The probability of expected payment/performance under each of these guarantees is remote except for "WPD guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated entities" and "Indemnification of lease termination and other divestitures." The total recorded liability at   September 30, 2016  , was   $22 million   for PPL and   $17 million   for LKE. The total recorded liability at   December 31, 2015  , was   $25 million   for PPL and   $18 million   for LKE. For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, all guarantees of PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU also apply to PPL, and all guarantees of LG E and KU also apply to LKE.

(a) 
    Indemnifications related to certain liabilities, including a specific unresolved tax issue and those relating to properties and assets owned by the seller that were transferred to WPD Midlands in connection with the acquisition. A cross indemnity has been received from the seller on the tax issue. The maximum exposure and expiration of these indemnifications cannot be estimated because the maximum potential liability is not capped and the expiration date is not specified in the transaction documents. 
              (b) 
    Indemnification to the liquidators and certain others for existing liabilities or expenses or liabilities arising during the liquidation process. The indemnifications are limited to distributions made from the subsidiary to its parent either prior or subsequent to liquidation or are not explicitly stated in the agreements. The indemnifications generally expire   two   to   seven   years subsequent to the date of dissolution of the entities. The exposure noted only includes those cases where the agreements provide for specific limits. 
     In connection with their sales of various businesses, WPD and its affiliates have provided the purchasers with indemnifications that are standard for such transactions, including indemnifications for certain pre-existing liabilities and environmental and tax matters or have agreed to continue their obligations under existing third-party guarantees, either for a set period of time following the transactions or upon the condition that the purchasers make reasonable efforts to terminate the guarantees. Additionally, WPD and its affiliates remain secondarily responsible for lease payments under certain leases that they have assigned to third parties. 
           (c) 
    Relates to certain obligations of discontinued or modified electric associations that were guaranteed at the time of privatization by the participating members. Costs are allocated to the members and can be reallocated if an existing member becomes insolvent. At   September 30, 2016  , WPD has recorded an estimated discounted liability for which the expected payment/performance is probable. Neither the expiration date nor the maximum amount of potential payments for certain obligations is explicitly stated in the related agreements, and as a result, the exposure has been estimated. 
              (d) 
    A third party logistics firm provides inventory procurement and fulfillment services. The logistics firm has title to the inventory, however, upon termination of the contracts, PPL Electric has guaranteed to purchase any remaining inventory that has not been used or sold. 
              (e) 
    LKE provides certain indemnifications covering the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective obligations. The most comprehensive of these guarantees is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by WKE under a 2009 Transaction Termination Agreement. This guarantee has a term of   12   years ending July 2021, and a maximum exposure of   $200 million  , exclusive of certain items such as government fines and penalties that fall outside the cap. Another WKE-related LKE guarantee covers other indemnifications related to the purchase price of excess power, has a term expiring in 2023, and a maximum exposure of   $100 million  . In May 2012, LKE's indemnitee received an unfavorable arbitration panel's decision interpreting this matter. In October 2014, LKE's indemnitee filed a motion for discretionary review with the Kentucky Supreme Court seeking to overturn the arbitration decision, and such motion was denied by the court in September 2015. In September 2015, a counterparty issued a demand letter to LKE's indemnitee. In February 2016, the counterparty filed a complaint in Henderson, Kentucky Circuit Court, seeking an award of damages in the matter. The proceeding is currently in the discovery phase. LKE does not believe appropriate contractual, legal or commercial grounds exist for the claim made and has disputed the demands. LKE believes its indemnification obligations in the WKE matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including additional legal and contractual developments, as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power. Although the parties have also conducted certain settlement discussions, the ultimate outcomes of the WKE termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time. Additionally, LKE has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates. The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum, and LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party. LKE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various indemnification scenarios, but does not expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded. 
              (f) 
    Pursuant to the OVEC power purchase contract, LG E and KU are obligated to pay for their share of OVEC's excess debt service, post-retirement and decommissioning costs, as well as any shortfall from amounts included within a demand charge designed and expected to cover these costs over the term of the contract. LKE's proportionate share of OVEC's outstanding debt was   $124 million   at   September 30, 2016  , consisting of LG E's share of   $86 million   and KU's share of   $38 million  . The maximum exposure and the expiration date of these potential obligations are not presently determinable. See "Energy Purchase Commitments" and "Guarantees and Other Assurances" in Note 13 in PPL's, LKE's, LG E's and KU's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on the OVEC power purchase contract. 
       
  The Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote.

PPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. The coverage provides maximum aggregate coverage of   $225 million  . This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements. 

11. Related Party Transactions 
    
  Support Costs     (PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  PPL Services and LKS provide their respective PPL and LKE subsidiaries and each other with administrative, management and support services. PPL EU Services provides the majority of financial, supply chain, human resources and facilities management services primarily to PPL Electric. PPL Services provides certain corporate functions to PPL Electric. For all service companies, the costs of these services are charged to the respective recipients as direct support costs. General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific entity are allocated and charged to the respective recipients as indirect support costs. PPL Services and PPL EU Services use a three-factor methodology that includes the applicable recipients' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees to allocate indirect costs. LKS bases its indirect allocations on the subsidiaries' number of employees, total assets, revenues, number of customers and/or other statistical information. PPL Services, PPL EU Services and LKS charged the following amounts for the periods ended   September 30  , including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense on the books of the recipients, based on methods that are believed to be reasonable. 

In addition to the charges for services noted above, LKS makes payments on behalf of LG E and KU for fuel purchases and other costs for products or services provided by third parties. LG E and KU also provide services to each other and to LKS. Billings between LG E and KU relate to labor and overheads associated with union and hourly employees performing work for the other company, charges related to jointly-owned generating units and other miscellaneous charges. Tax settlements between LKE and LG E and LKE and KU are reimbursed through LKS. 
    
  Intercompany Borrowings     (LKE) 
    
  LKE maintains a   $225 million   revolving line of credit with a PPL Energy Funding subsidiary whereby LKE can borrow funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $138 million   and   $54 million   were outstanding and were reflected in "Notes payable with affiliate" on the Balance Sheets. The interest rate on borrowings is equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. The interest rates on the outstanding borrowing at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   2.02%   and   1.74%  . 
    
  LKE has a   $400 million     ten  -year note with a PPL affiliate with an interest rate of   3.5%  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the note was reflected in "Long-term debt to affiliate" on the Balance Sheets.

13. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). A market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis. Transfers between levels are recognized at end-of-reporting-period values. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. See Note 1 in each Registrant's   2015   Form 10-K for information on the levels in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The assets and liabilities measured at fair value were:

  Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities - Interest Rate Swaps/Foreign Currency Contracts/Cross-Currency Swaps   (  PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  To manage interest rate risk, PPL, LKE, LG E and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. To manage foreign currency risk, PPL uses foreign currency contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency contracts. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., LIBOR and government security rates) and forward foreign currency exchange rates (e.g., GBP), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level 3.

  Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value     (All Registrants) 
    
  The carrying amounts of long-term debt on the Balance Sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below. The fair values were estimated using an income approach by discounting future cash flows at estimated current cost of funding rates, which incorporate the credit risk of the Registrants. Long-term debt is classified as Level 2. The effect of third-party credit enhancements is not included in the fair value measurement.

    Amounts are net of debt issuance costs. 
       
  The carrying value of short-term debt (including notes between affiliates), when outstanding, approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates associated with the short-term debt and is classified as Level 2. 

14. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
    
  Risk Management Objectives 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  PPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances and foreign exchange (including price, liquidity and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). The Risk Management Committee, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Director-Risk Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions, verification of risk and transaction limits, value-at-risk analyses (VaR, a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level) and the coordination and reporting of the Enterprise Risk Management program. 
    
  Market Risk 
    
  Market risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as market liquidity and volumetric risks. Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Many of the contracts meet the definition of a derivative. All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected. 
    
  The following summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and its subsidiaries. 
    
  Interest rate risk 

PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances. PPL and WPD hold over-the-counter cross currency swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on interest and principal payments from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. LKE and LG E utilize over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt. PPL, LKE, LG E and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuances. 
                
    PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities and derivatives held by defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, the regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery mechanisms in place. 
       
  Foreign currency risk 

PPL is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk primarily associated with its investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates. 

61 

     Table of Contents  

Commodity price risk 
    
  PPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below.    

PPL Electric is exposed to commodity price risk from its obligation as PLR; however, its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates its exposure to this risk. PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to commodity price risk by entering into full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers. These supply agreements transfer the commodity price risk associated with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers.    
                
    LG E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel and fuel-related expenses. In addition, LG E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.    
       
  Volumetric risk 
    
  PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.    

WPD is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. Under the RIIO - ED1 price control period, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. See Note 1 in PPL's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on revenue recognition under RIIO - ED1.    
                
    PPL Electric, LG E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.    
       
  Equity securities price risk 

PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated at the regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery mechanisms in place. 
                
    PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases. 
       
  Credit Risk 
    
  Credit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance. 
    
  PPL is exposed to credit risk from "in-the-money" interest rate and foreign currency derivatives with financial institutions, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below. 
    
  In the event a supplier of LKE (through its subsidiaries LG E and KU) or PPL Electric defaults on its obligation, those entities would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thus mitigating the financial risk for these entities. 
    
  PPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit. 
    
  Master Netting Arrangements 
    
  Net derivative positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements. 
    
  PPL, LKE, LG E and KU had no obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  PPL, LKE and LG E posted   $8 million   of cash collateral under master netting arrangements at   September 30, 2016   and   $9 million   of cash collateral under master netting arrangements at   December 31, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

KU did not post any cash collateral under master netting arrangements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  See "Offsetting Derivative Instruments" below for a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  PPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. Various financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolio, adjust the duration of the debt portfolio and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  Interest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL held no such contracts at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, PPL had no hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate derivatives and an insignificant amount of hedge ineffectiveness for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, PPL had an insignificant amount of ineffectiveness associated with interest rate derivatives. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , PPL held an aggregate notional value in cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of   $802 million   that range in maturity from   2017   through   2028   to hedge the interest payments and principal of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. In May 2016,   $460 million   of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes were repaid upon maturity and   $460 million   notional value of cross-currency interest rate swap contracts matured. PPL recorded a   $46 million   gain upon settlement of the cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, which largely offset a loss recorded on the revaluation of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. 
    
  Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring. 
    
  PPL had no cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . As a result of the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, all PPL cash flow hedges associated with PPL Energy Supply were ineffective and discontinued and therefore, reclassified into earnings during the second quarter 2015 and reflected in discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30,   2015  . See Note 8 for additional information. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded. 
    
  Economic Activity     (PPL, LKE and LG E) 
    
  LG E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments on variable rate debt. Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including a terminated swap contract, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized in "Interest Expense" on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At   September 30, 2016  , LG E held contracts with a notional amount of   $179 million   that range in maturity through   2033  .

Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates. PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments. In addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected GBP earnings. 
    
  Net Investment Hedges 
    
  PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD. There were no such contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , PPL had   $22 million   of accumulated net investment hedge after tax gains (losses) that were included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI, compared to   $19 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Economic Activity 
    
  PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to economically hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings. At   September 30, 2016  , the total exposure hedged by PPL was approximately    1.8 billion   (approximately   $2.4 billion   based on contracted rates). These contracts had termination dates ranging from   October 2016   through   December 2018  . 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, PPL settled foreign currency hedges related to 2017 and 2018 anticipated earnings, resulting in receipt of approximately   $310 million   of cash, and entered into new hedges at current market rates. The notional amount of the settled hedges was approximately    1.3 billion   (approximately   $2.0 billion   based on contracted rates) with termination dates from   January 2017   through   November 2018  . The settlement did not have a significant impact on net income as the hedge values were previously marked to fair value and recognized in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statement of Income. 
    
  Accounting and Reporting 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless NPNS is elected. NPNS contracts for PPL and PPL Electric include certain full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair values of LG E's and KU's interest rate swaps that are recognized as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. See Note 6 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  See Notes 1 and 17 in each Registrant's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on accounting policies related to derivative instruments.

  Offsetting Derivative Instruments 
    
  PPL, LKE, LG E and KU or certain of their subsidiaries have master netting arrangements in place and also enter into agreements pursuant to which they purchase or sell certain energy and other products. Under the agreements, upon termination of the agreement as a result of a default or other termination event, the non-defaulting party typically would have a right to set off amounts owed under the agreement against any other obligations arising between the two parties (whether under the agreement or not), whether matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or place of booking of the obligation. 
    
  PPL, LKE, LG E and KU have elected not to offset derivative assets and liabilities and not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral pledged (an asset) or the obligation to return cash collateral received (a liability) under derivatives agreements. The table below summarizes the derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements and related cash collateral received or pledged. 

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
    
  Certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features which, when in a net liability position, would permit the counterparties to require the transfer of additional collateral upon a decrease in the credit ratings of PPL, LKE, LG E and  
  
   68 

     Table of Contents  

KU or certain of their subsidiaries. Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade. In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. 
    
  Additionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL's, LKE's, LG E's, and KU's obligations under the contracts. A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity. This would typically involve negotiations among the parties. However, amounts disclosed below represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with "adequate assurance" features. 
    
  (PPL, LKE and LG E) 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , derivative contracts in a net liability position that contain credit risk-related contingent features, collateral posted on those positions and the related effect of a decrease in credit ratings below investment grade are summarized as follows:

15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  The change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was due to the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on the U.K. Regulated segment. 
    
  The change in the other intangible assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in the gross carrying amount of indefinite lived intangibles at WPD attributable to new easements of   $73 million  , partially offset by the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. 

16. Asset Retirement Obligations 
    
  (PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  The changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were as follows. 

69 

     Table of Contents  

LG E and KU recorded decreases to existing ARO balances of   $118 million   (  $24 million   at LG E and   $94 million   at KU) during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to revisions in the amounts and timing of future expected costs related to the closure of CCR impoundments. These revisions are the result of changes in closure plans related to expected costs and timing of closure. Further changes to AROs, capital plans or operating costs may be required as estimates of future cash flows are refined based on closure developments and regulatory or legal proceedings. 
    
  PPL's, LKE's, LG E's and KU's ARO liabilities are primarily related to CCR closure costs. See Note 10 for information on the final CCR rule and Note 6 for information on the rate recovery applications with the KPSC. LG E's and KU's accretion and ARO-related depreciation expense are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no net earnings impact.

18. New Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Accounting for Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance that establishes a comprehensive new model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. This model is based on the core principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
    
  For public business entities, this guidance can be applied using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, beginning in annual reporting periods after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years. Public business entities may early adopt this guidance in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Registrants expect to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. 
    
  The Registrants continue to assess the impact of adopting this guidance, as well as the transition method they will use, and are monitoring the development of industry specific application guidance which could impact those assessments. 
    
  Accounting for Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance for leases. This new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model for lessees, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. 
    
  Lessor accounting under the new guidance is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to current practice, lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type. 
    
  The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. 
    
  The Registrants are currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance.

Accounting for Financial Instrument Credit Losses 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires the use of a current expected credit loss (CECL) model for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments within the scope of this guidance, which includes accounts receivable. The CECL model requires an entity to measure credit losses using historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events, rather than the incurred loss impairment model required under current GAAP. 
    
  For public business entities, this guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. All entities may early adopt this guidance beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years. 
    
  The Registrants are currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance and the period that they will adopt this guidance.

Introduction 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  PPL, headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a utility holding company. PPL, through its regulated utility subsidiaries, delivers electricity to customers in the U.K., Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee; delivers natural gas to customers in Kentucky; and generates electricity from power plants in Kentucky. In June 2015, PPL completed the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply which combined its competitive power generation businesses with those of Riverstone to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. See Note 8 in PPL's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.

  In addition to PPL, the other Registrants included in this filing are as follows. 
    
  (PPL Electric) 
    
  PPL Electric, headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PPL and a regulated public utility that is an electricity transmission and distribution service provider in eastern and central Pennsylvania. PPL Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PUC, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. PPL Electric delivers electricity in its Pennsylvania service area and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that area as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. 
    
  (LKE) 
    
  LKE, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a wholly owned subsidiary of PPL and a holding company that owns regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, LG E and KU, which constitute substantially all of LKE's assets. LG E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. LG E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas. LG E and KU maintain separate corporate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names. KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name and in Tennessee under the KU name.

a public utility by the KPSC, the VSCC and the Tennessee Regulatory Authority, and certain of its transmission and wholesale power activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. KU serves its Virginia customers under the Old Dominion Power name and its Kentucky and Tennessee customers under the KU name. 

Business Strategy 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Following the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model consisting of seven diverse, high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success. 
    
  PPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG E and KU plan to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base and RAV, as applicable, driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through 2020 at PPL Electric. 
    
  For the U.S. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work in progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on prudently incurred costs. 
    
  Rate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in strong earnings growth for the foreseeable future. Net income from the U.K. Regulated segment is expected to be relatively flat through 2016. In 2017, earnings are expected to decline for the U.K. Regulated segment mainly due to the unfavorable impact of lower GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rates. RAV growth is expected in the U.K. Regulated segment through the RIIO-ED1 price control period and earnings are expected to grow after 2017 commensurate with RAV growth  .   See "Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment" of PPL's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on RIIO-ED1. 
    
  To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. See "Financial Condition - Risk Management" below for further information.  
    
  Earnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Due to the significant earnings contributed from WPD, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. See "Financial and Operational Developments - U.K. Membership in European Union" for a discussion of the U.K. earnings hedging activity in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. 
    
  The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.

As discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and efficiency of operations.

  U.K. Membership in European Union 
    
  Significant uncertainty exists concerning the effects of the June 23, 2016 referendum in favor of the U.K. withdrawal from the European Union (EU). In October 2016, the U.K. Prime Minister, Theresa May, announced her intent to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (Article 50) by March 31, 2017. Article 50 specifies that if a member state decides to withdraw from the EU, it should notify the European Council of its intention to leave the EU, negotiate the terms of withdrawal and establish the legal grounds for its future relationship with the EU. Article 50 provides two years from the date of the Article 50 notification to conclude negotiations. Failure to complete negotiations within two years, unless negotiations are extended, would result in the treaties governing the EU no longer being applicable to the U.K. with there being no agreement in place governing the U.K.'s relationship with the EU. Under the terms of Article 50, negotiations can only be extended beyond two years if all of the 27 remaining EU states agree to an extension. Any withdrawal agreement will need to be approved by both the European Council and the European Parliament. There remains significant uncertainty as to whether the events referred to in the Prime Minister's announcement will occur within the times suggested as well as the ultimate outcome of the withdrawal negotiations and the related impact on the U.K. economy and the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
    
  In response to the decrease in the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate that occurred subsequent to the U.K.'s vote to withdraw from the EU, PPL has executed additional hedges to mitigate the foreign currency exposure to the Company's U.K. earnings. In the third quarter of 2016, PPL settled existing hedges related to 2017 and 2018 anticipated earnings, resulting in receipt of approximately $310 million of cash, and entered into new hedges at current market rates. The notional amount of the settled hedges was approximately  1.3 billion (approximately $2.0 billion based on contracted rates) with termination dates from January 2017 through November 2018. The settlement did not have a significant impact on net income as the hedge values were previously marked to fair value and recognized in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statement of Income.  
    
  Additionally, in the third and fourth quarters of 2016, PPL restructured existing hedges related to 2016 and 2017 anticipated earnings and entered into additional hedges using forward contracts for 2018. This restructuring did not have a significant impact on 2016 expected net income as the hedge values continue to be marked to fair value. As of October 31, 2016, PPL's foreign currency exposure related to budgeted earnings is 91% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at an average rate of $1.29 per GBP, 94% hedged for 2017 at an average rate of $1.25 per GBP and 93% hedged for 2018 at an average rate of $1.42 per GBP. 
    
  PPL cannot predict either the short-term or long-term impact to foreign exchange rates or long-term impact on PPL's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of any actions that may be taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the EU, although such impacts could be significant.

  U.K. Distribution Revenue Reduction 
    
  In December 2013, WPD and other U.K. DNOs announced agreements with the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem to a reduction of  5 per residential customer of electricity distribution revenues that otherwise would have been collected in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2014. Full recovery of the revenue reduction in GBP, together with the associated carrying cost will occur in the regulatory year which began April 1, 2016. Under GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for under-recovery of regulated income (which this reduction represents). As a result, revenues for the U.K. Regulated segment were adversely affected by $19 million ($15 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) in 2015 and $40 million ($31 million after-tax or $0.05 per share) in 2014. Revenues for the U.K. Regulated segment were positively affected by $14 million ($11 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) and $24 million ($19 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. PPL projects revenues in 2016 will be positively affected by $37 million ($29 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) and revenues for 2017 will be positively affected by $17 million ($14 million after-tax or $0.02 per share).    
    
  U.K. Tax Rate Change 
    
  The U.K. Finance Act 2016, enacted in September 2016, reduces the U.K. statutory income tax rate effective April 1, 2020 from 18% to 17%. As a result of this change, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $42 million in the third quarter of 2016. Of this amount, $37 million relates to deferred taxes recorded in prior years and is treated as a special item.  
    
  Discount Rate Change for U.K. Pension Plans  
    
  In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD historically used a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. WPD began using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost for the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost in 2016. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , this change in discount rate resulted in lower net periodic defined benefit costs recognized on PPL's Statement of Income of   $10 million   (  $8 million   after-tax or   $0.01   per share) and   $31 million   (  $25 million   after-tax or   $0.04   per share). Based on current estimates, PPL expects this change to reduce net periodic defined benefit costs recognized on PPL's Statement of Income by $40 million ($32 million after-tax or $0.05 per share) in 2016. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Defined Benefits" in PPL's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information. 
    
  Rate Case Proceedings 
    
  (PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  On November 1, 2016, LG E and KU announced that on November 23, 2016, they anticipate filing requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $103 million at KU and an increase in annual base electricity and gas rates of approximately $94 million and $14 million at LG E. The proposed base rate increases to be requested are an electricity rate increase of 6.4% at KU and electricity and gas rate increases of 8.5% and 4.2% at LG E and would become effective in July 2017. LG E's and KU's applications include requests for CPCNs for implementing an Advanced Metering System program and a Distribution Automation program. The applications are to be based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 and a requested return-on-equity of 10.23%. LG E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

On October 31, 2016, KU filed a request with the FERC to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of CCR impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. The filing was made in accordance with FERC Order No. 631 whereby a rate filing is required to include the costs of ARO's in rates. If approved, KU will begin including the closure costs in its annual true-up filing for 2016 for new rates effective July 1, 2017. The filing is not expected to have a material impact on KU. 

Results of Operations 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  The "Statement of Income Analysis" discussion addresses significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   with the same periods in 2015. The discussion for PPL provides a review of results by reportable segment. The "Segment Earnings" discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as non-GAAP financial measures, including  Earnings from Ongoing Operations  and  Margins . This discussion provides explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. 
    
  Tables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within "Statement of Income Analysis" and "Segment Earnings" are presented on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. Results computed on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average U.K. foreign currency exchange rate.

  Statement of Income Analysis 
    
  Net income for the periods ended   September 30   includes the following results. 

Operating Revenues 
    
  The increase (decrease) in operating revenues for the   periods   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   was due to: 

80 

     Table of Contents  

(b) 
    Decreases due to lower recoveries of fuel and energy purchases due to lower commodity costs at LKE and lower recoveries of energy purchases at PPL Electric. 
       
  Fuel 
    
  Fuel decreased $88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in market prices for coal and natural gas.    
    
  Energy Purchases 
    
  Energy purchases decreased by   $26 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015  , primarily due to a $37 million decrease in PLR prices, partially offset by a $14 million increase in PLR volumes at PPL Electric. 
    
  Energy purchases decreased by   $145 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   2015  , primarily due to a $90 million decrease in PLR prices and a $23 million decrease in PLR volumes at PPL Electric, a $14 million decrease in natural gas volumes and a $13 million decrease in natural gas prices at LKE.  
    
  Other Operation and Maintenance 
    
  The increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance for the   periods   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   was due to: 

(a) 
    The decrease for the nine month period was primarily due to a reduction of costs associated with the 2015 retirement of units at the Cane Run and Green River plants, partially offset by Cane Run 7 operations. 
              (b) 
    The decrease for the nine month period was primarily due to higher discount rates and deferred amortization of actuarial losses. 
              (c) 
    The increase for the nine month period was due to corporate costs allocated to PPL Energy Supply (and included in discontinued operations) prior to the June 2015 spinoff. As a result of the spinoff on June 1, 2015, these corporate costs now remain in continuing operations.  
              (d) 
    The decreases were primarily due to an increase in estimated returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a change in the discount rate methodology.  
       
  Depreciation 
    
  Depreciation increased by   $6 million   and   $34 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015  , primarily due to additional assets placed into service, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates at WPD, net of retirements. 

81 

     Table of Contents  

Other Income (Expense) - net 
    
  Other income (expense) - net decreased by   $26 million   and increased by   $223 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015  , primarily due to changes in realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency contracts to economically hedge GBP denominated earnings from WPD. 
    
  Interest Expense  
    
  The increase (decrease) in interest expense for the   periods   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   was due to: 

(a) 
    The increase in both periods was primarily due to debt issuances at WPD in November 2015, LG E and KU in September 2015 and PPL Capital Funding in May 2016 as well as higher interest rates on bonds refinanced in September 2015 at LG E and KU. 
       
  Income Taxes  
    
  The increase (decrease) in income taxes for the   periods   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   was due to: 

(a) 
    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, PPL recorded a $9 million tax benefit related to a planned amendment of a prior period tax return. 
       
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, PPL recorded a tax benefit to adjust the settled refund amount approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation for the open audit years 1998-2011.   
           (b) 
    The U.K. Finance Act 2016, enacted in September 2016, reduces the U.K. statutory income tax rate effective April 1, 2020 from   18%   to   17%  .  As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (c) 
    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, PPL recorded lower income tax expense related to the application of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 
       
  See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 
    
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) 
    
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) includes the results of operations of PPL Energy Supply, which was spun off from PPL on June 1, 2015 and substantially represents PPL's former Supply segment. See "Discontinued Operations" in Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

     Table of Contents  

Segment Earnings 
    
  PPL's net income by reportable segments for the   periods   ended   September 30   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also includes certain costs related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 
              (b) 
    As a result of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, substantially representing PPL's former Supply segment, the earnings of the Supply segment prior to the spinoff are included in Discontinued Operations. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes an $879 million charge reflecting the difference between PPL's recorded value for the Supply segment and its estimated fair value as of the spinoff date, determined in accordance with applicable accounting rules under GAAP. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 
       
  Earnings from Ongoing Operations 
    
  Management utilizes "Earnings from Ongoing Operations" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.     
    
  Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the effective tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items include:    
    
       Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency-related economic hedges (as discussed below).    
       Supply segment discontinued operations.    
       Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.    
       Impairment charges.     
       Workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.    
       Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.    
       Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.    
    
  Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges include the changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts used to hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately within GAAP earnings. Management believes that excluding these amounts from Earnings from Ongoing Operations until settlement of the contracts provides a better matching of the financial impacts of those contracts with the economic value of PPL's underlying hedged earnings.   See Note 14 to the Financial Statements and "Risk Management" below for additional information on foreign currency-related economic activity.  
    
  PPL's Earnings from Ongoing Operations by reportable segment for the   periods   ended   September 30   were as follows:

See "Reconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations" below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net Income. 
    
  U.K. Regulated Segment 
    
  The U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global, which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from GBP into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs and allocated financing costs. The U.K. Regulated segment represents   64%   of PPL's Net Income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   39%   of PPL's assets at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Net Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations for the periods ended   September 30   include the following results. 

The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, impacted the U.K. Regulated segment's results and are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations during the periods ended   September 30  . 

(a) 
    Represents unrealized gains (losses) on contracts that economically hedge anticipated GBP-denominated earnings.  The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include the reversal of $310 million ($202 million after-tax) of unrealized gains related to the settlement of 2017 and 2018 contracts.  
     
   84 

     Table of Contents  

(b) 
    In the third quarter of 2016, PPL settled 2017 and 2018 foreign currency contracts, resulting in $310 million of cash received ($202 million after-tax).  The settlement did not have a material impact on net income as the contracts were previously marked to fair value and recognized in "Other Income (Expense)-net" on the Statement of Income. 
              (c) 
    The U.K. Finance Act 2016, enacted in September 2016, reduces the U.K. statutory income tax rate effective April 1, 2020 from 18% to 17%. As a result of this change, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $42 million in the third quarter of 2016. Of this amount, $37 million relates to deferred taxes recorded in prior years and was treated as a special item. 
        
  The changes in the components of the U.K. Regulated segment's results between these periods are due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as U.K. Gross Margins, the items that management considers special and the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange, including the effects of foreign currency hedge contracts, on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. 

U.K. 

See "Margins - Changes in Margins" for an explanation of U.K. Gross Margins. 

Lower other operation and maintenance expense for the three month period primarily due to $21 million from lower pension expense due to an increase in estimated returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a change in the discount rate methodology and $2 million from lower network maintenance expense. 

Lower other operation and maintenance expense for the nine month period primarily due to $64 million from lower pension expense due to an increase in estimated returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a change in the discount rate methodology, partially offset by $13 million from higher network maintenance expense. 
       
     Kentucky Regulated Segment 
    
  The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LG E and KU, as well as LG E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Kentucky Regulated segment represents   22%   of PPL's Net Income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   36%   of PPL's assets at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Net Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations for the periods ended   September 30   include the following results.

The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, impacted the Kentucky Regulated segment's results and are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations during the periods ended   September 30  . 

(a) 
    Recorded at PPL and allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The amount represents a settlement between E.ON AG (a German corporation and the indirect parent of E.ON US Investments Corp., the former parent of LKE) and PPL for a tax matter. 
              (b) 
    Recorded at LKE and represents a valuation allowance against tax credits expiring in 2016 and 2017 that are more likely than not to expire before being utilized. 
       
  The changes in the components of the Kentucky Regulated segment's results between these periods are due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Kentucky Gross Margins and the items that management considers special on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.  

See "Margins - Changes in Margins" for an explanation of Kentucky Gross Margins. 

Lower other operation and maintenance expense for the nine month period primarily due to $12 million of lower coal plant operations and maintenance expense as a result of units retired in 2015 at the Cane Run and Green River plants and $10 million of lower pension expense mainly due to higher discount rates and deferred amortization of actuarial losses. 

Higher interest expense for the   three and nine   month   periods   primarily due to the September 2015 issuance of $550 million of incremental First Mortgage Bonds by LG E and KU, higher interest rates on the September 2015 issuance of $500

million of First Mortgage Bonds by LG E and KU used to retire the same amount of First Mortgage Bonds in November 2015 and $400 million of notes refinanced by LKE in November 2015.  
    
  Pennsylvania Regulated Segment 
    
  The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric.  In addition, certain costs are allocated to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment represents   18%   of PPL's Net Income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   24%   of PPL's assets at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Net Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations for the periods ended   September 30   include the following results. 

(a) 
    There are no items that management considers special for the periods presented. 
       
  The changes in the components of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins on a separate line and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. 

See "Margins - Changes in Margins" for an explanation of Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins. 

Lower other operation and maintenance expense for the three month period primarily due to $6 million of lower payroll related costs and $6 million of lower bad debt expenses. 

Higher other operation and maintenance expense for the nine month period primarily due to $10 million of higher corporate service costs allocated to PPL Electric and $9 million of higher costs for additional work done by outside vendors, offset by $19 million of lower payroll related costs. 

Higher depreciation expense for the three and nine month periods primarily due to transmission and distribution additions placed into service related to the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure, net of retirements.

Margins 
    
  Management also utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses: 

"U.K. Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the U.K. Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, direct costs such as connection charges from National Grid, which owns and manages the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, and Ofgem license fees (recorded in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues, as they are costs passed through to customers. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across WPD's distribution network in the U.K. and directly related activities. 

"Kentucky Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, LKE, LG E and KU, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's, LKE's and LG E's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded in "Other operation and maintenance", "Depreciation" and "Taxes, other than income" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations. 

"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution delivery operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and PPL Electric. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "Energy purchases," "Other operation and maintenance," (which are primarily Act 129 and Universal Service program costs), and "Taxes, other than income," which is primarily gross receipts tax. This performance measure includes PLR energy purchases by PPL Electric from PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected in "Energy purchases from affiliate" in the reconciliation tables. As a result of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and the formation of Talen Energy, PPL EnergyPlus (renamed Talen Energy Marketing) is no longer an affiliate of PPL Electric. PPL Electric's purchases from Talen Energy Marketing subsequent to May 31, 2015 are reflected in "Energy Purchases" in the reconciliation tables. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity delivery operations. 
       
  These measures are not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations.  
  
   89 

     Table of Contents  

Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget. 
    
  Changes in Margins 
    
  The following table shows Margins by PPL's reportable segment and by component, as applicable, for the periods ended   September 30   as well as the change between periods. The factors that gave rise to the changes are described following the table. 

U.K. Gross Margins 
    
  U.K. Gross Margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $59 million from the April 1, 2016 price increase, which includes $14 million of the recovery of prior customer rebates, partially offset by $16 million of lower volumes. 
    
  U.K. Gross Margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $89 million from the April 1, 2015 price decrease resulting from the commencement of RIIO-ED1 and lower volumes of $37 million, partially offset by $97 million from the April 1, 2016 price increase, which includes $24 million of the recovery of prior customer rebates, and $21 million of other revenue adjustments in 2016. 
    
  Kentucky Gross Margins 
    
  Kentucky Gross Margins increased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   primarily due to $22 million of increased sales volumes ($9 million at LG E and $13 million at KU) driven by warmer weather. 
    
  Kentucky Gross Margins increased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   primarily due to higher base rates of $68 million ($4 million at LG E and $64 million at KU) and returns on additional environmental capital investments of $11 million at LG E. The increase in base rates was the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes of $10 million ($2 million at LG E and $8 million at KU) driven by milder weather in the first quarter of 2016.

Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins 
    
  Distribution 
    
  Distribution margins increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $30 million of higher base rates, effective January 1, 2016 as a result of the 2015 rate case combined with a $12 million favorable impact of warmer summer weather. 
    
  Distribution margins increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $93 million of higher base rates, effective January 1, 2016, partially offset by a $13 million unfavorable impact of milder winter weather. 
    
  Transmission 
    
  Transmission margins increased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to returns on additional capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability.

  2016   Outlook 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  Higher net income is expected in   2016   compared with   2015  , primarily attributable to the results of the 2015 spinoff of the Supply segment. Higher Earnings from Ongoing Operations are expected in   2016   compared with   2015  , primarily attributable to increases in the Pennsylvania Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments. The following projections and factors underlying these projections are provided for PPL's segments and the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants. 
    
  (PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment) 
    
  Net income is expected to be relatively flat in 2016 compared with 2015. Lower Earnings from Ongoing Operations are projected in   2016   compared with   2015   due to the unfavorable impact of lower GBP exchange rates, higher interest expense and depreciation, partially offset by higher revenues and lower operation and maintenance expense, including pension expense. 
    
  (PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  Higher net income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations are projected in   2016   compared with   2015  , primarily driven by electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, higher returns on additional environmental capital investments, and lower operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and higher interest expense. 
    
  (PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric) 
    
  Higher net income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations are projected in   2016   compared with   2015  , primarily driven by higher base electricity rates for distribution effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission earnings from additional capital investments, partially offset by higher depreciation and a benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipts tax reserve. 
    
  (PPL's Corporate and Other Category) 
    
  Relatively flat costs are projected in   2016   compared with   2015  . 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Earnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," the rest of this Item 2, Notes 6 and 10 to the Financial Statements and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q (as applicable) and "Item 1. Business" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.

Financial Condition 
    
  The remainder of this Item 2 in this Form 10-Q is presented on a combined basis, providing information, as applicable, for all Registrants. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  The Registrants had the following at: 

(a) 
    At   September 30, 2016  , $8 million of cash and cash equivalents were denominated in GBP. If these amounts would be remitted as dividends, PPL would not anticipate a material incremental U.S. tax cost. Historically, dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries have been limited to distributions of the current year's earnings. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements in PPL's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on undistributed earnings of WPD.

  The Statements of Cash Flows separately report the cash flows of the discontinued operations in 2015. The "Operating Activities", "Investing Activities" and "Financing Activities" sections below included only the cash flows of continuing operations. 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the nine month period ended   September 30  , and the changes between periods, were as follows. 

Operating Activities 
    
  The components of the change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   were as follows. 

(PPL) 
    
  PPL's cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in   2016   increased   $542 million   in   2016   compared with   2015  . 
             
    Income from continuing operations increased by $239 million between the periods. This included an additional $146 million of net non-cash charges, including $124 million of lower unrealized gains on hedging activities primarily due to the settlement of hedges in the third quarter of 2016 and an increase in deferred income taxes, partially offset by defined benefit plan income (primarily due to an increase in estimated returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a change in the discount rate for the U.K. pension plans).  

The $102 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in taxes payable (primarily due to an increase in current income tax expense in 2016) and an increase in accounts payable (due to timing of payments), partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (due to lower volumes as a result of unfavorable weather as compared to 2015) and a net increase in current regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities (due to the timing of rate recovery mechanisms). 
     
   105 

     Table of Contents  

(PPL Electric) 
    
  PPL Electric's cash provided by operating activities in   2016   increased   $222 million   in   2016   compared with   2015  . 
             
    The increase in non-cash components of $42 million in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and deferred income tax expense.  

The $74 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments) and a decrease in prepayments (primarily due to higher tax prepayments in 2015) partially offset by a net increase in current regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities (due to the timing of rate recovery mechanisms). 

(LKE)  
    
  LKE's cash provided by operating activities in   2016   decreased   $79 million   compared with   2015  . 
             
    The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by lower tax payments received from PPL for the use of prior year excess tax depreciation deductions. Other decreases in cash were related to accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to lower weather volatility during the measurement periods in 2016, and coal and natural gas inventories due to milder weather in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower payments on accounts payable due to lower fuel purchases. 

The increase in cash from other operating activities was driven primarily by a decrease in cash outflows for the settlement of interest rate swaps. LG E and KU settled interest rate swaps in the third quarter of 2015 which did not occur in 2016. 
       
  (LG E)  
    
  LG E's cash provided by operating activities in   2016   decreased   $86 million   compared with   2015  . 
             
    The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by lower tax payments received from LKE for the use of prior year excess tax depreciation deductions. Other decreases in cash were related to accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to lower weather volatility during the measurement periods in 2016, coal and natural gas inventories due to milder weather in the first quarter of 2016, and accounts receivable from affiliates due to lower intercompany settlements associated with capital expenditures, partially offset by lower payments on accounts payable due to lower fuel purchases. 

The increase in cash from other operating activities was driven primarily by a decrease in cash outflows for the settlement of interest rate swaps. LG E settled interest rate swaps in the third quarter of 2015 which did not occur in 2016. 
       
  (KU) 
    
  KU's cash provided by operating activities in   2016   decreased   $41 million   compared with   2015  . 
             
    The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by lower tax payments received from LKE for the use of prior year excess tax depreciation deductions. Other decreases in cash were related to accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to lower weather volatility during the measurement periods in 2016, and coal inventory due to milder weather in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by accounts payable to affiliates due to lower intercompany settlements associated with capital expenditures and lower payments on accounts payable due to lower fuel purchases. 

The increase in cash from other operating activities was driven primarily by a decrease in cash outflows for the settlement of interest rate swaps. KU settled interest rate swaps in the third quarter of 2015 which did not occur in 2016.

Investing Activities 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Expenditures for Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Investment in PP E is the primary investing activity of the registrants. The change in expenditures for PP E for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   was as follows. 

For PPL, the decrease in expenditures was due to lower project expenditures at WPD, PPL Electric Utilities, LG E, and KU. The decrease in expenditures for WPD was primarily due to a decrease in expenditures to enhance system reliability associated with the end of the DPCR5 price control period and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in expenditures for PPL Electric was primarily due to the completion of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project and the completion of the Northeast Pocono reliability project. The decrease in expenditures for LG E was primarily driven by the completion of the environmental air projects at LG E's Mill Creek plant. The decrease in expenditures for KU was primarily driven by the completion of the environmental air projects at KU's Ghent plant and the CCR project at KU's E.W. Brown plant.   
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  The components of the change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   was as follows. 

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for information on   2016   short and long-term debt activity, equity transactions and PPL dividends. See the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K for information on   2015   activity. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  The Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in "Short-term debt" on the Balance Sheets. At   September 30, 2016  , the total committed borrowing capacity and the use of that capacity under these credit facilities was as follows:

    The amounts borrowed at   September 30, 2016   were a USD-denominated borrowing of $200 million and GBP-denominated borrowings which equated to $171 million. The unused capacity reflects the USD-denominated borrowing amount borrowed in GBP of  153 million as of the date borrowed. At   September 30, 2016  , the USD equivalent of unused capacity under the U.K. committed credit facilities was $1 billion. 
       
  The commitments under the U.K. credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank providing more than 13% of the total committed capacity. 
    
  See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the Registrants' credit facilities. 
    
  Intercompany (LKE, LG E and KU) 

(a) 
    LG E and KU participate in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE, LG E and/or KU make available funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues. However, the FERC has issued a maximum short-term debt limit for each utility at $500 million from any source. 
       
  See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of intercompany credit facilities. 
    
  Commercial Paper     (All Registrants) 
    
  PPL, PPL Electric, LG E and KU maintain commercial paper programs to provide an additional financing source to fund short-term liquidity needs, as necessary. Commercial paper issuances, included in "Short-term debt" on the Balance Sheets, are supported by the respective Registrant's Syndicated Credit Facility. The following commercial paper programs were in place at   September 30, 2016  :

Long-term Debt 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  In May 2016, PPL Capital Funding issued   $650 million   of   3.10%   Senior Notes due 2026. PPL Capital Funding received proceeds of   $645 million  , net of a discount and underwriting fees, which will be used to invest in or make loans to subsidiaries of PPL, to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  In May 2016, WPD (East Midlands) borrowed  100 million at 0.4975% under a new ten-year index linked term loan agreement, which will be used for general corporate purposes.  
    
  In May 2016, WPD plc repaid the entire   $460 million   principal amount of its   3.90%   Senior Notes upon maturity.  
    
  In October 2016, WPD (East Midlands) issued an additional    40 million   of its   2.671%   Index-linked Senior Notes due   2043  . WPD (East Midlands) received proceeds of    83 million  , which equated to   $101 million   at the time of issuance, net of fees and including a premium. The principal amount of the notes is adjusted based on changes in a specified index, as detailed in the terms of the related indentures. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 
    
  (PPL and PPL Electric) 
    
  In March 2016, the LCIDA issued   $116 million   of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2016A due   2029   and   $108 million   of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2016B due   2027   on behalf of PPL Electric. The bonds were issued bearing interest at an initial term rate of   0.90%   through their mandatory purchase dates of   September 1, 2017   and   August 15, 2017  . Thereafter, the method of determining the interest rate on the bonds may be converted from time to time at PPL Electric's option. The proceeds of the bonds were used to redeem   $116 million   of   4.70%   Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2005 Series A due   2029   and   $108 million   of   4.75%   Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2005 Series B due   2027   previously issued by the LCIDA on behalf of PPL Electric. 
    
  In connection with the issuance of each of these new series of LCIDA bonds, PPL Electric entered into a loan agreement with the LCIDA pursuant to which the LCIDA has loaned to PPL Electric the proceeds of the LCIDA bonds on payment terms that correspond to the LCIDA bonds. In order to secure its obligations under the loan agreement, PPL Electric issued   $224 million   of First Mortgage Bonds under its 2001 Mortgage Indenture, which also have payment terms that correspond to the LCIDA bonds. 
    
  (PPL, LKE and LG E)  
    
  In September 2016, the County of Trimble, Kentucky issued   $125 million   of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2016 Series A (Louisville Gas and Electric Company Project) due   2044   on behalf of LG E. The bonds were issued with a floating interest rate that initially will reset weekly. The method of determining the interest rate on the bonds may be converted from time to time at LG E s option. The proceeds of the bonds were used to redeem   $83 million   of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2000 Series A (Louisville Gas and Electric Company Project) due   2030   and   $42 million   of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2002 Series A (Louisville Gas and Electric Company Project) due   2032   previously issued by the County of Trimble, Kentucky on behalf of LG E.  
    
  (PPL, LKE and KU)  
    
  In August 2016, the County of Carroll, Kentucky issued   $96 million   of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2016 Series A (Kentucky Utilities Company Project) due   2042   on behalf of KU. The bonds were issued bearing interest at an initial term rate of   1.05%   through their mandatory purchase date of   September 1, 2019  . Thereafter, the method of determining the interest rate on the bonds may be converted from time to time at KU s option. The proceeds of the bonds were used to redeem   $96 million   of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2002 Series C (Kentucky Utilities Company Project) due   2032   previously issued by the County of Carroll, Kentucky on behalf of KU.  
    
  (PPL) 
    
  ATM Program 
    
  For the periods ended   September 30  , PPL issued the following: 
  
   109 

     Table of Contents  

Common Stock Dividends 
    
  In   August 2016  , PPL declared a quarterly common stock dividend, payable   October 3, 2016  , of   38 cents   per share (equivalent to   $1.52   per annum). Future dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors. 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions. In the second quarter of 2016, PPL decreased its projected capital spending for the period 2016 through 2020 related to distribution facilities by approximately $1.1 billion from the $9.5 billion projection previously disclosed in PPL's 2015 Form 10 K. The decreased projected capital spending results from a change in the forecasted GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate from $1.60 to $1.30 for WPD expenditures that decreased each yearly estimate by approximately $220 million.  
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  In 2016, PPL decreased its estimated contractual cash obligations by approximately $2.0 billion from the $39.1 billion estimate previously disclosed in PPL's 2015 Form 10-K. The decrease was primarily a result of the change in the GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate from $1.50 to $1.30 as of September 30, 2016 for WPD's obligations. The decreases in PPL's estimated contractual cash obligations by year were as follows. 

Rating Agency Actions 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Moody's and S P have periodically reviewed the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. 
    
  A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. 
    
  The rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries during   2016  : 
    
  (PPL) 
    
  In February 2016, Moody's and S P affirmed their commercial paper ratings for PPL Capital Funding's $1.0 billion commercial paper program. 
    
  In May 2016, Moody's and S P assigned ratings of Baa2 and BBB+ to PPL Capital Funding's $650 million 3.10% Senior Notes due 2026. 

110 

     Table of Contents  

In June 2016, S P assigned a long-term issuer rating of A- and a short-term issuer rating of A-2 to PPL Capital Funding. 
    
  (PPL Electric) 
    
  In February 2016, Moody's and S P affirmed their commercial paper ratings for PPL Electric's $400 million commercial paper program. 
    
  In February 2016, Moody's and S P assigned ratings of A1 and A to LCIDA's $116 million 0.90% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2029 and $108 million 0.90% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2027, issued on behalf of PPL Electric. 
    
  (LG E) 
    
  In September 2016, Moody's and S P assigned ratings of A1 and A to LG E's Trimble Country 2016 Series A $125 million Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2044. 
    
  (KU) 
    
  In August 2016, Moody's and S P assigned ratings of A1 and A to KU's Carroll County 2016 Series A $96 million Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2042. 
    
  Ratings Triggers 
    
  (PPL, LKE, LG E and KU) 
    
  Various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LKE's, LG E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL, LKE and LG E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  For additional information on the Registrants' liquidity and capital resources, see "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K. 

Risk Management 
    
  Market Risk 
    
  (All Registrants) 
    
  See Notes 13 and 14 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations. 
    
  The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest  
  
   111 

     Table of Contents  

rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases. 
    
  The following interest rate hedges were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 

(a) 
    Includes accrued interest, if applicable. 
              (b) 
    Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, except for cross-currency swaps which also includes a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. 
              (c) 
    Cross-currency swaps are utilized to hedge the principal and interest payments of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings. 
              (d) 
    Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. 
       
  The Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on interest expense at   September 30, 2016   was insignificant for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt at   September 30, 2016   is shown below. 

Foreign Currency Risk (PPL) 
    
  PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through investments in U.K. affiliates. Under its risk management program, PPL may enter into financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including translation risk of expected earnings, firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments. 
    
  The following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 

112 

     Table of Contents  

(a) 
    Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. 
              (b) 
    To economically hedge the translation risk of expected earnings denominated in GBP. 
       
  (All Registrants) 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  PPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below.    

PPL Electric is exposed to commodity price risk from its obligation as PLR; however, its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates its exposure to this risk. PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to commodity price risk by entering into full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers. These supply agreements transfer the commodity price risk associated with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers.    
                
    LG E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel and fuel-related expenses. In addition, LG E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.    
       
  Volumetric Risk 
    
  PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.    

WPD is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. Under the RIIO - ED1 price control period, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. See Note 1 in PPL's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on revenue recognition under RIIO - ED1.    
                
    PPL Electric, LG E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.    
       
  Credit Risk     (All Registrants) 
    
  See Notes 13 and 14 to the Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and "Risk Management - Credit Risk" in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K for additional information. 

Foreign Currency Translation     (PPL) 
    
  The value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $840 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which primarily reflected a $1.6 billion decrease to PP E and $375 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $995 million decrease to long-term debt and a $160 million decrease to other net liabilities. Changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $101 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which primarily reflected a $209 million decrease to PP E and $54 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $131 million decrease to long-term debt and a $31 million decrease to other net liabilities. The impact of foreign currency translation is recorded in AOCI. 

Related Party Transactions     (All Registrants) 
    
  The Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU.

Table of Contents  

Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures     (All Registrants) 
    
  The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the more significant activities. 

Environmental Matters     (All Registrants) 
    
  Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to PPL's, PPL Electric's, LKE's, LG E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are subject to rate recovery. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. 
    
  See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental matters including: 
             
    Legal Matters,

Application of Critical Accounting Policies     (All Registrants  ) 
    
  Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following table summarizes the accounting policies by Registrant that are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations, and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. See "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K for a discussion of each critical accounting policy.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
    
  The Registrants' principal executive officers and principal financial officers, based on their evaluation of the Registrants' disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Registrants' disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to the Registrants and their consolidated subsidiaries is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms, particularly during the period for which this quarterly report has been prepared. The aforementioned principal officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  (b) Change in internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors  
    
  There have been no material changes in the Registrants' risk factors from those disclosed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2016 except the following:

  Risks related to our U.K. segment 
    
  PPL s earnings may be adversely affected as a result of the June 23, 2016 referendum in the U.K. to withdraw from the European Union. 
    
  Significant uncertainty exists concerning the effects of the June 23, 2016 referendum in favor of the U.K. withdrawal from the European Union, including whether formal withdrawal will occur and the nature and duration of negotiations between the U.K. and European Union as to the terms of any withdrawal. PPL cannot predict the impact, either short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or PPL s long-term financial condition that may be experienced as a result of any actions that may be taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the European Union, although such impacts could be significant.

           11.2 
    Nothing expressed or implied in this Facility Letter or any other document in connection herewith shall be regarded as in any way negating or affecting any right which the Bank may have under applicable law to apply any credit balances to which the Borrower is entitled on any account of the Borrower in or towards satisfaction of any sum due from the Borrower hereunder. 

If at any time any one or more of the provisions of this Facility Letter is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not thereby be affected, reduced or impaired in any way.

           13.1 
    No failure on the part of the Bank to exercise, and no delay on its part in exercising, any right or remedy under this Facility Letter will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in this Facility Letter are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or otherwise. 
       
           13.2
