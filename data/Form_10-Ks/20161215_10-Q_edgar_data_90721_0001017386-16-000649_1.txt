Note 1  Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information
and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The condensed balance sheet at November 30, 2015 was derived from audited
financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Operating results for the three-month period ended February 29, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ended November 30, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2015. 

For a summary of significant accounting policies
(which have not changed from November 30, 2015), see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November
30, 2015. 

Marketable securities  

The Company classifies investments in equity
securities bought and held primarily to be sold in the short term that have readily determinable fair values, as trading securities.
Unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities are included in earnings. Any unrealized holding gains and losses from
available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are recorded in comprehensive income until a gain or loss has been
realized. 

Note 2   Going Concern Matters and
Realization of Assets  

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
ordinary course of business. However, the Company has sustained substantial losses from its operations in recent years and as of
February 29, 2016, the Company has negative working capital of $8,949,983 and a stockholders  deficit of $9,358,078. In addition,
the Company is unable to meet its obligations as they become due and sustain its operations. The Company believes that its existing
cash resources are not sufficient to fund its continuing operating losses, debt payments and working capital requirements. 

The Company may not be able to raise sufficient
additional debt, equity or other cash on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient revenues, achieve certain
other business plan objectives or raise additional funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of
operations, cash flows and financial position, including its ability to continue as a going concern, and may require it to significantly
reduce, reorganize, discontinue or shut down its operations. 

In view of the matters described above, recoverability
of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations
of the Company which, in turn, is dependent upon the Company s ability to meet its financing requirements on a continuing
basis, and to succeed in its future operations.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue in its existence.  Management s plans include efforts to preserve current
revenue sources, develop new revenue sources and negotiate further debt reductions with creditors. 

There can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its business plan objectives   or be able
to achieve or maintain cash-flow-positive operating results. If the Company is unable to generate adequate funds from operations
or raise sufficient additional funds, the Company may not be able to repay its existing debt, continue to operate its network,
respond to competitive pressures or fund its operations. As a result, the Company may be required to significantly reduce, reorganize,
discontinue or shut down its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.

Note 3   Recent Accounting Pronouncements
and Accounting Principles  

In
May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition
model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that
reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The revised effective date for this ASU
is for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and early adoption will be permitted, but not earlier
than the original effective date of annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, for public entities. We
will adopt this ASU when effective. Companies may use either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to adopt this
ASU and our management is currently evaluating which transition approach to use.  We are currently evaluating the possible
impact of ASU 2014-09, but we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under this amendment, management is now required to determine every interim and annual
period whether conditions or events exist that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. If management indicates that it is probable the entity will
not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within the assessment period, then management must evaluate whether it is
probable that plans to mitigate those factors will alleviate that substantial doubt. The guidance is effective for fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a significant
impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In
 April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   ASU 2015-03
requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. 
ASU 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The new guidance will
be applied on a retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted.  The Company chose early adoption of the new guidance,
which resulted in an additional debt discount at November 30, 2015 of $258,065, due to financing fees .
For the three months ended February 28, 2015, amortization of deferred finance costs have been reclassified to amortization of
debt discount, due to the retrospective application of the guidance.  

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes
(Topic 740)   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes,
the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement
of financial position.  The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial
position.  The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset
and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update.  For public business entities, the amendments
in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods.  For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December
15, 2018.  Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. 
The amendments in this Update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively
to all periods presented.  If an entity applies the guidance prospectively, the entity should disclose in the first interim
and first annual period of change, the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and a statement that prior periods
were not retrospectively adjusted.  If an entity applies the guidance retrospectively, the entity should disclose in the first
interim and first annual period of change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and quantitative information
about the effects of the accounting change on prior periods.  We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-17 to have a significant
impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

In January 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-01    Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10)   Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   ASU 2016-01, among other changes, requires equity investments (except
those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  This Update also simplifies the impairment assessment
of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. 
The amendments in ASU 2016-01 will become effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU
2016-01 will have on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

8 

In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02    Leases (Topic 842).  Under ASU 2016-02, entities will be required to recognize
lease asset and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases.  Among other changes in accounting
for leases, a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability)
and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  When measuring assets and
liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee
is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease.  Similarly,
optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included in the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities
only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that purchase option.  The amendments in ASU 2016-02 will become effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods with those fiscal years, for public business entities. 
We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. 

In March 2016,
the FASB issued ASC 2016-09    Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee
Share-based Payment Accounting.   The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows.  In addition to these simplifications, the amendments eliminate the guidance
in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. 
The amendments in ASC 2016-09 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts
the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that
interim period.  An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  We are currently
evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or
cash flows. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipt and Cash Payments. The new guidance addresses
certain classification issues related to the statement of cash flows which will eliminate the diversity of practice in how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the possible impact of ASU 2016-15,
but do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position
or cash flows. 

In October
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control.
The new guidance amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision make of a VIE should treat
indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining
whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 2016. Early
adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the possible impact of ASU 2016-17, but do not anticipate that it will have
a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries after elimination of significant intercompany
balances and transactions. The operations of a 90% owned subsidiary, Canalytix LLC, is included beginning on March 25, 2015, and
the operations of a 60% owned subsidiary, Grow Big Supply, LLC ( GBS ) is included beginning on July 6, 2015. 

On January 26, 2016,
the Company foreclosed on the non-controlling ownership, which amounted to 40%, of GBS. As of that date, GBS became a wholly-owned
subsidiary. In February 2016, we were provided significant financial incentives from GBS s landlord to close the GBS store
and we staged the contents of the store so it could be moved to another location. We laid off our staff at the store, except for
our Chief Science Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and we moved our inventory to temporary storage while we searched for a
location that would allow us to perform scientific work in the cannabis industry. However, before the contents of the store were
moved, a theft occurred that was engineered by approximately 10 individuals. The Company submitted an insurance claim for approximately
$296,000, based on the coverages that were stated in our commercial theft insurance policy. The insurance company is offering a
settlement of $25,000 based upon the conclusion that a former employee engineered the theft. As a result of the acquisition of
the non-controlling interest, which occurred without any additional consideration, the Company recorded the entire amount of the
non-controlling interest of $316,607 as a reduction to capital in excess of par value.

Note 4   Major Customers  

During the three-month periods
ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015,  one customer accounted for 0% and 38%,
respectively,  of the Company s revenues. 

As of February 29,
2016 there was no accounts receivable.  As of November 30, 2015, one customer accounted for 12% of the gross amount of accounts
receivable, and such amount was fully reserved.  

Note 5   Net Income (Loss) Per Common
Share  

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net income available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of vested, common shares outstanding
during the period (denominator). Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
if-converted method. Dilutive potential common shares include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, warrants
and convertible debt agreements. 

Approximately 21,082,129,000 and 11,903,811,000
shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, warrants or convertible debt were excluded from
the calculation of net loss per share for the three-month periods ended February 29, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because the effect
would be anti-dilutive. 

Note 6   Stock-Based Compensation
Plans  

The Company issues stock options to its employees,
consultants and outside directors pursuant to stockholder-approved and non-approved stock option programs and records the applicable
expense in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For the three-month period ended
February 29, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $0 and $4,000, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense. At February
28, 2015, there is no remaining unrecognized employee stock-compensation expense for previously granted unvested options. 

Note 7   Accounts Payable and Accrued
Expenses  

Accounts
payable and accrued expenses consist of trade payables and accrued liabilities that individually are less than 5% of the Company s
current liabilities.   

10 

Note 8   Defined Benefit Plan  

The Company received a letter dated July 27,
2011 from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, ( PBGC ), stating that the Company s defined benefit pension
plan (the  Plan ) was terminated as of September 30, 2010, and the PBGC was appointed trustee of the Plan. Pursuant
to the agreement, the PBGC has a claim to the Company for the total amount of the unfunded benefit liabilities of the Plan plus
accrued interest. The PBGC has notified the Company that the liability is due and payable as of the termination date, and interest
accrues on the unpaid balance at the applicable rate provided under Section 6621(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The total amount
outstanding to the PBGC February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015 was 2,130,461 and $2,104,410, respectively, including accrued interest,
which is recorded as a current liability. The Company made no payments to the Plan in the three-month periods ended February 29,
2016 and February 28, 2015.  The Plan covers approximately 40 former employees. 

Effective June 30, 1995, the Plan was frozen,
ceasing all benefit accruals and resulting in a plan curtailment.  As a result of the curtailment, it has been the Company s
policy to recognize the unfunded status of the Plan as of the end of the fiscal year with a corresponding charge or credit to earnings
for the change in the unfunded liability.  There was no pension expense recorded in the three-month periods ended February
29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. 

Effective January 14, 2015, the Company executed
a settlement and release agreement with the PBGC pursuant to which PBGC agreed to accept $100,000 in full satisfaction of all amounts
that had been due from the Company, which amounted to $2,130,461 at February 29, 2016. The Company agreed to pay the sum of $100,000
to PBGC in equal installments of $25,000 on January 31, 2015, April 30, 2015, July 31, 2015 and October 31, 2015. Upon receipt
of the settlement amount, the PBGC shall be deemed to have released the Company from any and all employer liability and fiduciary
responsibility. No installment payments have been made and the Company has not received a default notice from PBGC.   

Note 9   Debt  

At February 29, 2016,
future payments under long-term debt obligations over each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows:  

Convertible
subordinated debt   

 During February 2013, the Company entered into
a securities purchase agreement with 112359 Factor Fund, LLC (the  Fund ) pursuant to which the Company issued to the
Fund (i) an amended convertible debenture in the principal amount of $1,000,000 ( Amended Note 1 ) and (ii) a second
amended convertible debenture in the principal balance of $1,000,000 ( Amended Note 2  and together with Amended Note
1, the  Amended Notes ).  The Amended Notes were sold to the Fund by the Company in exchange for the Fund s
assumption and payment to Laurus Master Fund ( Laurus ) amounts due under an assignment agreement (which required the
Fund to make payments totaling $350,000, of which $250,000 was paid, to Laurus), payment to the Company of $150,000, and the agreement
to purchase from another lender and cancel an existing convertible debenture in the amount of approximately $35,000. 

11 

The Amended Notes originally matured on December
31, 2014. Amended Note 1 was modified in January 2015 to mature on December 31, 2015 and the Fund agreed that upon payment in full
of the remaining balance of Amended Note 1, that Amended Note 2 would be considered paid in full.  Interest accrues on
the unpaid principal and interest on the notes at a rate per annum equal to 6% for Amended Note 1 and 2% for Amended Note 2. 

Principal and interest payments on Amended
Note 1 can be made at any time by the Company, with a 30% prepayment premium, or the Fund can elect at any time to convert any
portion of Amended Note 1 into shares of common stock of the Company at 100% of the volume weighted average price of the common
stock for the 30 trading days immediately prior to the conversion date.   The Fund did not submit a conversion notice
during the three months ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. 

The conversion price of Amended Note 1 is based
on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a  fixed-for-fixed  option as defined under FASB ASC Topic
No. 815 - 40. The fair value of the note was recognized as a derivative instrument at the issuance date and was measured at fair
value at each reporting period. The Company determined that the fair value of the notes was $1,703,423 at the issuance dates. The
value of the debt of $1,000,000 was recorded as a debt discount and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes.
The variance to the fair value of $703,423 was recognized as an initial loss and recorded to interest expense. 

Amended Note 2 converts into shares of common
stock of the Company in an amount equal to the lesser of the outstanding balance of Amended Note 2 divided by $0.01. Any principal
or interest amount can be paid in cash. 

During the year ended November 30, 2013, the
Fund also loaned the Company amounts of $50,000, $35,000 and $12,000 (the  Bridge Notes ). In June 2013, the Fund refinanced
the Bridge Notes with additional funding into another note for $665,000 (the  New Note ). The additional funding under
the New Note provided cash to purchase two outstanding convertible debentures for an aggregate price of $99,360; cash for operations
of $60,000 in June 2013; and $40,000 in cash each month for the months of July 2013 through December 2013. The Company incurred
$68,640 in finder fees and legal fees in connection with the New Note, and a $100,000 original issuance discount. The New Note
bears interest at 6% per annum and is due December 31, 2015. The New Note can be converted at any time into shares of common stock
of the Company at 60% of the volume weighted average price of the common stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the
conversion date, as defined. The Company received an aggregate of $300,000 in cash under the New Note in the months of June through
December 2013 under the New Note. 

The conversion price of the $665,000 of variable
conversion price note is based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a  fixed-for-fixed  option as
defined under FASB ASC Topic No. 815 - 40. The fair value of the conversion feature was recognized as a derivative instrument at
the issuance date and is measured at fair value at each reporting period. The Company determined that the fair value of the conversion
feature was $1,103,940 at the issuance date. Debt discount was recorded up to the $665,000 face amount of the note and is amortized
to interest expense over the term of the note. The fair value of the conversion feature in excess of the principal amount allocated
to the notes in the aggregate amount of $478,940 was expensed immediately as additional interest expense. 

In conjunction with the New Note, the Company
agreed to implement a salary deferral plan to reduce the cash expenditures for personnel, to limit its cash expenditures to certain
pre-approved items, and to accrue an additional fee to the Fund of $150,000, which was included in interest expense and added to
the principal balance of Amended Note 1.   The Fund agreed to limit its sales of the Company s common stock, to
not engage in any short transactions involving the Company s common stock, and to not require the Company to increase its
authorized shares of common stock for a certain time period, even though the financing documents require the Company to reserve
authorized shares for issuance to the Fund, if the Fund desired to convert existing debt into shares of common stock. 

Effective January 20, 2015, the Company signed
a debt modification agreement with the Fund. The modification reduced the outstanding balance on Amended Note 1 from $280,190 to
$250,000, and provided that upon the completion of the payments required to retire Amended Note 1, the outstanding balance of Amended
Note 2 would be reduced from $1,000,000 to $0. The Fund subsequently assigned the remaining balance of Amended Note 1 and the related
security agreements to EXO Opportunity Fund LLC ( EXO ). The Company also received $25,000 in cash in February 2015,
in conjunction with a variable rate convertible debenture payable to EXO ( the EXO Note), which matured on December 31, 2015,
bears interest at an annual rate of 6%, and is subject to the same security agreements as Amended Note 1. 

The conversion price of the EXO Note is based
on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a  fixed-for-fixed  option as defined under FASB ASC Topic
No. 815 - 40. The fair value of the notes was recognized as a derivative instrument at the issuance date and is measured at fair
value at each reporting period. The Company determined that the fair value of the note was $74,990 at the issuance date. Debt discount
was recorded up to the $25,000 face amount of the note and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the note. The fair
value of the conversion feature in excess of the principal amount allocated to the notes in the aggregate amount of $49,990 was
expensed immediately as additional interest expense. 

12 

On January 21, 2015, the Company signed a second
debt modification agreement with the Fund. This modification provided for the reduction of the principal balance of the New Note
from $634,600 to $250,000, subject to certain conditions precedent. The Fund assigned a $250,000 portion of the New Note and the
related security agreements to two new debt holders in equal amounts of $125,000 each.    

In conjunction with the debt modification agreement
for Amended Note 1, the Company recognized a gain on troubled debt restructuring of $527,469 for the three-month period ended February
28, 2015. 

On April 21,
2015, EXO purchased a $63,000 convertible note, with a minimum conversion price of $0.00005 per share, that the Company originally
issued to Diamond Remark LLC ( Diamond ) on September 4, 2014. EXO can elect at any time to convert any portion of
the debt into shares of common stock of the Company at a discount of 49% of the price of the common stock as defined in the agreement,
subject to a minimum conversion price of $0.00005 per share. On March 3, 2015, Diamond notified the Company that the Company was
in default and that in accordance with the default provisions of the lending agreement, the amount of money that the Company was
required to pay back to Diamond had increased due to default fees. The note was due on June 26, 2015, and remains in default. EXO
purchased the note for $97,675. In conjunction with the penalty clauses in the note and default fees due to EXO, on September 8,
2015, the Company issued an amended and restated convertible promissory note to EXO in the amount of $209,847, with the same conversion
terms and conditions as the original note issued to Diamond. The note matures on March 31, 2016 and bears interest at a rate of
8% per annum.   

 On May 11, 2015, the
Company signed a $140,000 convertible note agreement with FLUX Carbon Starter Fund (the  Flux Note 1 ), which matured
on December 31, 2015, and bears interest at an annual rate of 6%. The Flux Note 1 can be converted into the Company s common
stock at a price of $0.002 per share. In conjunction with the Flux Note, the Company received $68,000 in cash and recorded an original
issuance discount of $72,000 as interest expense. 

 On July 1, 2015, in conjunction
with the purchase of Plaid Canary Corporation ( PCC ) (see Note 14), the Company assumed a secured note payable to
FLUX Carbon Starter Fund in the amount of $627,000, (the  Flux Note 2 ) with an annual interest rate of 20%, that matured
on January 31, 2016. The Flux Note 2 can convert into shares of common stock of PCC at the market price of PCC s common stock.
The market price is defined as the lowest closing bid price of PCC s common stock during the previous 90 trading days. The
Flux Note 2 contains an original issuance discount of $313,500, $53,107 of which was expensed in the three-month period ended February
29, 2016. 

 The Amended Notes, New
Note, Flux Note 1, Flux Note 2 and notes payable to EXO (the  Subordinated Debt ) are subordinated to any debt payable
to TCA. In instances where the Subordinated Debt is past due, the Company is negotiating extended maturity dates. None of the Subordinated
Debt holders have issued the Company a default notice. The Company contests the validity and enforceability of the Amended Notes
because the asignees of the Amended Notes did not pay the full amount of consideration of $350,000 to Laurus to complete the assignment
of the Amended Notes. As noted above, the Company paid $70,000 of the required $350,000 payment, in order to complete the settlement
agreement with Laurus. 

  During
the three month period ended February 28, 2015, the Subordinated Debt holders converted $240,400 of principal into 1,159,047,428
shares of common stock of the Company and recorded a gain of $1,419,661 on the conversions.        

 At February 29, 2016
and November 30, 2015, the Company owed the Subordinated Debt holders $2,702,436 and $2,687,461, respectively. 

  Debt due to TCA  

 On October 14, 2015
the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with TCA , as lender, pursuant to which TCA agreed
to loan the Company up to a maximum of $5 million for working capital and general operating expenses. An initial amount of $500,000
was funded by TCA on October 14, 2015.  Any additional funding to be provided to the Company under the SPA will be at the
discretion of TCA. 

 Our obligation to
repay the $500,000 borrowed pursuant to the SPA is evidenced by TCA Debenture 1. The repayment of TCA Debenture 1 is secured by
a first position security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets and in substantially all of the assets of
the Company's subsidiaries, as evidenced by a security agreement between the Company and its subsidiaries and TCA, The Company
also pledged the stock it owns in its subsidiaries.  TCA Debenture 1 matures on April 14, 2017 and bears interest at the rate
of 18% per annum. Interest and principal payments are due in monthly installments beginning in November 2015 and February 2016,
respectively. 

13 

Upon the occurrence
of an event of default, TCA may convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other
sums due and payable under TCA Debenture 1 into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to 85% of
the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock during the five trading days immediately prior
to the applicable conversion date, in each case subject to a provision that no conversion may result in TCA becoming the beneficial
owner of more than 4.99% of the Company s outstanding common stock. 

The Company also
borrowed $100,000 from TCA on November 18, 2015, under a debenture with similar terms, except that the $100,000 debenture will
mature on November 18, 2016 ( TCA Debenture 2 ). 

Upon the sale of the
TCA Debenture 1, the Company also signed an advisory agreement and issued to TCA, as an advisory fee, 27,500 shares of Pervasip
Series I Preferred Stock. Each share of Series I Preferred Stock has a stated value of $10, which will be the share's priority
interest in the Company's net assets in the event of liquidation. Each share may be converted by the holder into a number of shares
of common stock equal to the stated value divided by the average of the five lowest closing bid prices during the ten trading days
immediately preceding conversion. The holder of Series I Preferred Stock will have voting rights equivalent to those of the common
stock into which the Series I shares are convertible. In the event that TCA does not realize net proceeds from the sale of these
Series I preferred shares or the common shares upon conversion of the preferred shares (the  Advisory Fee shares )
equal to the $275,000 fee value by the maturity date of the credit facility, these Advisory fee shares will become subject to mandatory
redemption by TCA, and the Company shall be liable to TCA for the net proceeds below an aggregate amount of $275,000. The Company
also issued to TCA 51 shares of Series J Preferred Stock. The Series J Preferred Stock will give TCA voting control of the Company
if the Company defaults on the note and TCA declares the voting control effective. 

 At February 29, 2016
and November 30, 2015, the Company owed TCA $570,028 and 600,000, respectively. 

   Convertible
Debt due to various lenders   

Convertible
debt with a fixed conversion rate    

At  February
28, 2016 and November 30, 2015,  the Company owed a lender $138,000, in connection with two
notes that are past due, are in default, bear a default interest rate of 18% per annum, and are convertible at prices of $0.015
and $0.02 cents per share.  

During
the year ended November 30, 2014, the Company received $63,000 in convertible debt with a minimum conversion price of $0.00005
per share. The lender can elect at any time to convert any portion of the debt into shares of common stock of the Company at a
discount of 49% of the price of the common stock as defined in the agreement, subject to a minimum conversion price of $0.00005
per share. At November 30, 2014 the Company owed the lender $63,000. The lender sold this note to EXO, as noted above.  

At February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
a total of $138,000 of convertible debt with a fixed conversion rate was outstanding. 

Convertible
debt with a variable conversion rate issued for cash   

During the three months ended February 28,
2015, the Company received a total of $152,500 in cash from two lenders for convertible debt. The convertible debt bears interest
at an annual rate of 6% to 8% and was due between June and October 2015. The lender can elect at any time to convert any portion
of the debt into shares of common stock of the Company, subject to a limit of 4.99% of the outstanding shares, at a price discount
ranging from 30% to 42% of the price of the common stock as defined in the agreements. 

The conversion price of the $152,500 of variable
conversion price notes is based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a  fixed-for-fixed  option
as defined under FASB ASC Topic No. 815 - 40. The fair value of the notes was recognized as a derivative instrument at the issuance
date and is measured at fair value at each reporting period. The Company determined that the fair value of the conversion feature
was $163,714 at the issuance dates.  The debt was recorded as a debt discount of $152,102
and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the note.  The fair value of the conversion feature in excess of the
principal amount allocated to the notes in the aggregate amount of $11,612 was expensed immediately as additional interest expense. 

At February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
a total of $115,000 of variable-rate convertible debt that had been issued for cash was outstanding, respectively. 

14 

Convertible
debt with a variable conversion rate assigned to lenders   

At  February
28, 2016 and November 30, 2015,  the Company owes one lender $67,750 as a result of an assignment
in fiscal 2012. The convertible debt bears interest at 0% and is past due. The lender can elect at any time to convert any portion
of the debt into shares of common stock of the Company at a price discount of 55% of the market price of the Company s common
stock as defined in the agreements.  

At February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
a total of $320,750 of other convertible debt was outstanding, respectively. 

Other
short-term debt due to various lenders      

During
the three months ended February 29, 2016 and 2015, the Company received $0 and $50,000, respectively from lenders in exchange for
notes payable that had no conversion features.   

At February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
the Company owed various lenders $214,208 and 224,448, respectively, for non-convertible notes. Cash payments were made on these
notes of $10,240 and $60,368 during the three months ended February 29, 2016  and 2015,
respectively.  Other short-term debt carries an interest rate of 0% to 17% over the term of the loans, and includes cash
advances (the  Cash Advances ) from lenders that purchased future sales. The Company agreed to repay the Cash Advances
at a premium to the amount received from the lender. For the three months ended February 29, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $97,818, respectively,
of amortization of premium from the Cash Advances is included in interest expense. At February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
Cash Advances totaled $108,409 and 118,649, respectively. Assets of two subsidiaries of the Company secure the Cash Advances, which
are currently in default. 

Long-term debt  

The Company acquired 90% of Canalytix LLC on
March 25, 2015. Canalytix owes Flux Carbon Starter Fund $424,589 and $409,614, as of February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively,
under a secured senior term loan agreement, which is included in long-term debt in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
The debt bears an annual interest rate of 12% and matures on December 31, 2019. Principal payments are made periodically from cash
flow. No principal payments are due until maturity. 

Note 10 - Derivative Liabilities  

The Company evaluated
its convertible note agreements pursuant to ASC 815 and for those notes in which there was no minimum or fixed conversion price
resulting in an indeterminate number of shares to be issued in the future, the Company determined an embedded derivative existed
and ASC 815 applied for its convertible notes. The Company valued the embedded derivatives using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Convertible debt with a variable conversion
feature  

In 2016, we estimated the fair value of
the derivatives using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of 0 years; (2) a computed volatility
rate of 357%; (3) a discount rate of 1%; and (4) zero dividends. Upon settlement the valuation of this embedded derivative was
recorded as gain/loss on derivative liability. 

In 2015, the Company estimated the fair
value of the derivatives using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of 0 to 0.84 years; (2)
a computed volatility rate of 787%; (3) a discount rate of 1%; and (4) zero dividends. Upon settlement the valuation of this embedded
derivative was recorded as gain/loss on derivative liability. 

Redeemable convertible preferred stock   

 In 2016, we estimated
the fair value of the derivatives using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term reflecting the
immediate exercisability; (2) a computed volatility rate of 357% (3) a discount rate of 1% and (4) zero dividends.  No preferred
stock derivatives existed in fiscal 2015.   

15 

Tainted conventional convertible debt  

In 2016, the Company estimated the fair
value of the derivative using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of .0 to .08 years; (2) a
computed volatility rate of 357%; (3) a discount rate of 1%; and (4) zero dividends. The valuation of this embedded derivative
was recorded with an offsetting gain/loss on derivative liability. 

In 2015, the Company estimated the fair
value of the derivative using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of .32 to .84 years; (2)
a computed volatility rate of 775%; (3) a discount rate of 1%; and (4) zero dividends.  The valuation of this embedded derivative
was recorded with an offsetting gain/loss on derivative liability. 

Tainted warrants  

The Company also evaluated all outstanding
warrants to determine whether these instruments may be tainted. All warrants outstanding were considered tainted as a result of
the tainted equity environment and potential inability of the Company to settle the instruments with shares of the Company s
stock as the number of shares issuable cannot be estimated and could exceed the amount of authorized shares available to be issued
by the Company. The Company valued the embedded derivatives within the warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model.   

In 2016, the Company estimated the fair
value of the derivative using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of 1.77 to 7.33 years; (2)
a computed volatility rate of 357%; (3) a discount rate of 1%; and (4) zero dividends. The valuation of this embedded derivative
was recorded with an offsetting gain/loss on derivative liability. 

In 2015, the Company estimated the fair
value of the derivative using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of .96 to 8.33 years; (2)
a computed volatility rate of 775%; (3) a discount rate of 1%; and (4) zero dividends.  The valuation of this embedded derivative
was recorded with an offsetting gain/loss on derivative liability. 

Activity for embedded derivative instruments during the three months
ended February 29, 2016 was as follows: 

Activity for embedded derivative instruments during the three months
ended February 28, 2015 was as follows:

Note 11   Stockholders  Equity  

As discussed
in Note 9, the Company entered into various transactions where it issued convertible notes to third parties. Such convertible notes
allowed the debt holders to convert outstanding debt principal into shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.00001,
(the  Common Stock ) at a discount to the trading price of the Common Stock. To the extent, if any, that there was
a beneficial conversion feature associated with these debts, the beneficial conversion feature was bifurcated from the host instrument
and accounted for as a freestanding derivative. As a result of such conversions, i n the three-month period ended February
28, 2015, $278,260 of principal and accrued interest was converted into 2,468,080,212 shares of Common Stock. Also during the first
quarter of 2015, the Company issued 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock for services rendered, which was valued at $4,000. 

No conversions of debt or stock issuances occurred
in the three-month period ended February 29, 2016 

A total of 175,000 and
100,000 shares of Series I preferred stock issued to TCA as advisory fees are redeemable upon the occurrence of certain events
that are outside the control of the company. These shares (and the common shares into which these shares may be converted, together,
 Advisory Fee Shares ) are also mandatorily redeemable in the event that TCA has not realized net proceeds from the
sale of the Advisory Fee Shares by the earlier of an event of default or on October 14, 2016 and November 18, 2016, for $175,000
and $100,000, respectively, less cash proceeds received from prior sales of Advisory Fee Shares. The total redemption amount of
$275,000 is being accreted over the respective twelve month periods using the effective interest method. A total of $5,324 of preferred
dividends were accreted for the Series I Preferred Stock issued to TCA during the three months ended February 29, 2016 

 Each share of Series
F and Series G convertible preferred stock is convertible into 250,000 and 500 shares of Common Stock, respectively, which gives
the holder of the Series F and Series G a beneficial conversion price. At the issuance date of January 13, 2015, the effective
conversion price was less than the fair value of the Common Stock into which the preferred shares are convertible. Consequently,
the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ). The intrinsic value of the BCF is limited to the basis
that is initially allocated to the convertible security. The Company recorded a discount on the preferred stock of $100,000 from
the value of the Series F and Series G shares issued in exchange for outstanding payables to the chief executive officer (see
Note 12   Related Party Transactions). The discount is being accreted to preferred stock dividends over a six-month period,
as the preferred stock is convertible after six months (date of earliest conversion). Accretion amounted to $36,541 for the three-month
period ended February 28, 2015. 

Note 12   Related Party Transactions  

At February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
we owed our chief executive officer $1,434,199 and $1,380,162, respectively, for loans he provided to the Company, unpaid salary
and unpaid business expenses. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company settled $100,000 in outstanding payables to
the chief executive officer of by issuing 10,000,000 shares each of the Company s Series F and G preferred stock and 10 shares
of the Company s Series E stock. 

At February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
we owed $380,130 and $222,918, respectively, to a company that is controlled by the entity that owned 60% of our voting control,
via ownership of our Series H preferred stock. 

Note 13   Fair Value  

The Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 
     inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.  

Level 2 
     inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  

Level 3 
     inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  

17 

Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, we base fair value on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is our policy to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance
with the fair value hierarchy. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there exists limited or no observable market
data and, therefore, are based primarily upon management s own estimates, are often calculated based on current pricing policy,
the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other such factors. Therefore, the
results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability.
Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including
discount rates and estimates of future cash flows that could significantly affect the results of current or future value. 

Valuation Hierarchy   

The table below presents the amounts of
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of February 29, 2016 and November 30, 2015: 

The fair value of restricted securities are
measured with quoted prices in active markets. The fair value of the derivatives that are traded in less active over-the-counter
markets are generally measured using pricing models with non-observable inputs.  These measurements are classified as
Level 3 within the fair value of hierarchy. 

The Company has no instruments with significant off balance sheet
risk. 

In 2016, we estimated the fair value of
the derivative using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of 0 to 8.08 years; (2) a computed
volatility rate of 357% (3) a discount rate of 1% and (4) zero dividends.  The valuation of this embedded derivative was recorded
with an offsetting gain/loss on derivative liability. 

In 2015, we estimated the fair value of
the derivative using the Black-Scholes valuation method with assumptions including: (1) term of 0 to 8.33 years; (2) a computed
volatility rate of 775% (3) a discount rate of 1% and (4) zero dividends.  The valuation of this embedded derivative was recorded
with an offsetting gain/loss on derivative liability. 

Fluctuations in the conversion discount percentage
have the greatest effect on the value of the conversion liabilities valuations during each reporting period. As the conversion
discount percentage increases for each of the related conversion liabilities instruments, the change in the value of the conversion
liabilities increases, therefore increasing the liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. The higher the conversion discount
percentage, the higher the liability. A 10% change in the conversion discount percentage would result in more than a $110,000 change
in our Level 3 fair value. 

Note 14 - Subsequent Events  

Between March 1, 2016
and November 30, 2016 the Company issued 126,000,000 shares of restricted common stock as a finders fee in conjunction with the
TCA financing on October 14, 2015. 

On August 24, 2016, Flux
Carbon Corporation agreed to return to the Company the 500,000 shares of Series H preferred stock that had been issued for the
purchase of Plaid Canary Corporation. 

In November 2016, we
secured a verbal agreement with a licensed grower and dispensary and we moved inventory from our storage into its warehouse. As
a result of our inability to continue operating GBS in manner similar to our fiscal 2015 operations, our sales in 2016 for GBS
are limited to approximately $280,000. 

On September 20, 2016,
the Company received a demand for payment from TCA Global Credit Master Fund, L.P. (the  TCA Fund ) of $1,164,460.50
pursuant to a Senior Secured Convertible Redeemable Debenture, dated June 30, 2015, and effective October 14, 2015; a Securities
Purchase Agreement, dated and effective the same, and that Promissory Note, dated and effective the same; a Senior Secured Convertible
Redeemable Debenture, dated June 30, 2015, and effective October 14, 2015; and a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30,
2015 and effective November 18, 2015. TCA Fund has also filed suit in the state of Florida to collect this past due amount, plus
interest that continues to accrue at the rate of $323.66 per day until the obligation is satisfied.

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other
reports filed by the Company from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, the  Filings )
contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available
to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof.
When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect, 
 future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they
relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current
view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors. Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned. 

Although the Company believes that the expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance,
or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not
intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). These accounting principles require us
to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely
are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These
estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would
be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting
treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its
application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce
a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. 

Overview  

During fiscal 2015
we transitioned from our cloud-based telecommunications business to pursue a cloud-based business focused on the emerging cannabis
industry. We purchased Canalytix LLC, which is developing a cloud-based application to monitor and control greenhouse facilities,
providing real-time data on energy usage, HVAC systems, lighting and costs. On July 1, 2015, we purchased Plaid Canary Corporation
( PCC ), a special purpose consolidation company organized to acquire companies and technologies in emerging agricultural
markets. On July 6, 2015, PCC acquired 60% of the membership units of Grow Big Supply LLC ( Grow Big ), which operated
a retail supply store in Denver, Colorado targeted at those involved in growing cannabis. 

  We planned
to use part of the Grow Big facility to provide laboratory testing and oil extraction services. The facility, however, was in a
warehouse district and it was too difficult to maintain the cleanliness required for laboratory work. In February 2016, we were
provided significant financial incentives from Grow Big s landlord to close our Grow Big store and move it to another location.
We laid off our staff at the store, except for our Chief Science Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and we moved our inventory
to temporary storage while we searched for a location that would allow us to perform scientific work and sell off our remaining
inventory. In November 2016, we secured a verbal agreement with a licensed grower and dispensary and we moved inventory from storage
into its warehouse. When our existing inventory is sold, we do not plan to continue the sale of gardening products. We believe
there is more value in providing scientific analysis and extraction services to entities that are operating under a cannabis license. 

  We have developed
scientific methods for the analysis of cannabinoids in flowers, concentrates, and edibles through the use of available instruments. As
our operations expand, we plan to assist medical marijuana specialty production facilities in order to better regulate, calculate
proper dosage, and improve consistency in the product.

Results of
Operations  

For the Three
Months Ended February 29, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended February 28, 2015  

Our revenue for the three-month period ended
February 29, 2016 increased by $278,486, to $279,380, as compared to $894 reported for the three-month period ended February 28,
2015. The increase in revenues was due to operation of a retail hydroponics store until February 9, 2016, which we acquired in
July 2015. We discontinued our hydroponics business in February 2016 and anticipate that we will become a scientific analysis agricultural-products
company in fiscal 2017. 

For the three-month period ended February 29,
2016, our gross profit amounted to $88,171, which was an increase of $87,903 from the gross profit of $268 reported in the three-month
period ended February 28, 2015. The increase in grow profit is directly attributable to the hydroponics store operation in fiscal
2016. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased by $236,833 or 352%, to $304,151 for the three-month period ended February 29, 2016 from $67,318 reported in the same
prior-year fiscal period. The increase is directly attributable to the operations of the hydroponics store, with the additional
personnel and selling expense, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015, when we operated as a voice over Internet service
provider with one employee. 

As a result of the above noted changes, our
loss from operations for the three-month period ended February 29, 2016 increased by $148,930 to $215,980 from $67,050 reported
in the prior-year fiscal period. However, significant non-operating income and expenses also occurred, thus: 

Interest expense, combined with the amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $25,094 to $334,978 for the three-month period ended February 29, 2016 as compared to $360,072 for the prior-year fiscal period.  The decrease in interest expense is attributable to less debt outstanding at February 29, 2016, which is partly offset by higher interest rates from the Company s new secured lender, which made loans of $600,000 to the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.  

For the three-month period ended February 29, 2016, we reported a gain on troubled debt restructuring of $0, as compared to a gain on troubled debt restructuring of $527,469 reported in the three-month period ended February 28, 2015. In the first quarter of 2015, we negotiated two debt modification agreements and one debt assignment agreement that produced a gain on troubled debt restructuring,  

For the three-month period ended February 29, 2016, we reported a gain on the settlement of derivative liabilities of $0, as compared to $115,953 in the three-month period ended February 28, 2015. Each instance of a liability settlement is contingent upon the valuation of the derivative at the time of the settlement, as compared to its value at the previous measurement date.  

For the three-month period ended February 29, 2016, we reported an impairment loss of $176,000 for an  other than temporary  decline in the market value of restricted securities.  We had no impairment losses for the three-month period ended February 28, 2015  

For the three-month period ended February 29, 2016, we had a gain from the change in the valuation of derivative liabilities of $558,919, as compared to a loss of $2,169,741 for the period three-month period ended February 28, 2015. The increase in the gain in three-month periods ended February 29, 2016 compared to 2015 is due to the lower market value of embedded derivatives in our debt instruments, at the end of the fiscal quarter, because of the decreasing price per share of our common stock at the end of the fiscal quarter.  

Our net result for the three-month period ended
February 29, 2016 was a net loss of $249,505 compared to a net loss of $1,953,441 reported in the prior-year fiscal period. In
fiscal 2015, the largest component of the net loss was the change in the valuation of derivative liabilities of $2,169,741, which
represented a change of $2,728,660 from the gain in the change in the valuation of derivative liabilities that was reported in
the three-month period ended February 29, 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At February 29, 2016, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $1,754 and negative working capital of $8,949,983. 

Operating activities for the three months ended
February 29, 2016 used $188,832 of cash, consisting principally of a net loss of $249,505, offset by approximately $129,000 in
non-cash income statement charges and approximately $190,000 in changes in operating assets and liabilities. Operating activities
for the three months ended February 28, 2015 used $24,209 of cash, consisting principally of a net loss of $1,953,441, offset by
approximately $1,753,000 in non-cash income statement charges and approximately $176,000 in changes in operating assets and liabilities. 

Net cash provided by financing activities aggregated
$174,108 and $25,000 for the three-month periods ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. In the three months
ended February 29, 2016, cash provided by financing activities resulted from proceeds from borrowings of $184,348, offset by principal
payments of $10,240. For the three months ended February 28, 2015, cash provided by financing activities resulted from proceeds
from short-term borrowing of $25,000. 

Net cash provided by investing activities amounted
to $7,500 and $0 for the three-month periods ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, as a result in a decrease in cash placed
under restriction. For the three months ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, we had no capital expenditures. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of our company as a going
concern.  However, we have sustained net losses from operations during the last several years, and we have very limited
liquidity.  Our operating losses have been funded through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings. Management
anticipates that we will be dependent, for the near future, on our ability to obtain additional capital to fund our operating expenses
and anticipated growth. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm, included in our Form 10-K for the year
ended November 30, 2015 expresses doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our operating losses have
been funded through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings. 

Although we have improved our balance sheet
with transactions to settle our debt, we continue to have liabilities in excess of our assets.  We are working to settle
our remaining liabilities and to raise cash to support our operating loss, and we continually consider a variety of possible sources.  In
the current economic environment, the procurement of outside funding is extremely difficult and there can be no assurance that
such financing will be available, or, if available, that such financing will be at a price that will be acceptable to us.  If
we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital, our operations will terminate. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.  

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures.  

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company s management, with the participation
of the Company s principal executive officer ( PEO ) / principal financial officer ( PFO ), evaluated
the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on this evaluation, the PEO / PFO concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the PEO /
PFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The material weaknesses in our disclosure controls
and procedures consisted of: 

There is a lack of accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US ( GAAP ) and the financial reporting requirements of the SEC;  

There are insufficient written policies and procedures to insure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and  

There is a lack of segregation of duties, in that we only had one person performing all accounting-related duties.  

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

There have not been any changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most
recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

21 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

We are currently not involved in any litigation
that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, except as described in
Note 14. Except as described in Note 14, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court,
public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of
our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries
or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision
could have a material adverse effect. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide information under this item. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.   

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.  

Except for matters described in Note 9 and
Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, there have been no defaults in the payment of principal, interest, sinking or
