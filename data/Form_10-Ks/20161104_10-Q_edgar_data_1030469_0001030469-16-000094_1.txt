NOTE 1             ORGANIZATION, CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS
OF PRESENTATION        

Nature of Operations      

OFG Bancorp (the  Company ) is a
publicly-owned financial holding company incorporated under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.     The
Company operates through various subsidiaries including, a commercial bank,
Oriental Bank (the  Bank ), a securities broker-dealer, Oriental Financial
Services Corp. ( Oriental Financial Services ), an insurance agency, Oriental
Insurance, LLC ( Oriental Insurance ) and a retirement plan administrator,
Oriental Pension Consultants, Inc. ( OPC ).     Through these subsidiaries and their respective divisions, the
Company provides a wide range of banking and financial services such as
commercial, consumer and mortgage lending, auto loans, financial planning,
insurance sales, money management and investment banking and brokerage
services, as well as corporate and individual trust services.         

On April 30, 2010, the Bank acquired certain assets and assumed
certain deposits and other liabilities of Eurobank, a Puerto Rico commercial
bank, in an FDIC-assisted acquisition. On December 18, 2012, the Company
acquired a group of Puerto Rico-based entities that included Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria Puerto Rico ( BBVAPR ), a Puerto Rico commercial bank, as
well as a securities broker-dealer and an insurance agency, which is referred
to herein as the  BBVAPR Acquisition.  The businesses acquired in these
acquisitions have been integrated with the Company s existing business.             

Recent Accounting Developments      

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued new accounting guidance that addresses eight specific cash flow
issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments
in this update apply to all entities, including both business entities and
not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows
under Topic 230.  The amendments in this update clarifies whether the following
items should be categorized as operating, investing or financing in the
statement of cash flows: (i) debt prepayments and extinguishment costs, (ii)
settlement of zero-coupon debt, (iii) settlement of contingent consideration,
(iv) insurance proceeds, (v) settlement of corporate-owned life insurance
(COLI) and bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies, (vi) distributions from
equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests in securitization
transactions, and (viii) receipts and payments with aspects of more than one
class of cash flows. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2018. The
Company does not expect the new accounting guidance to have a material impact
on its statement of cash flows.   

In June 2016, the FASB issued new
accounting guidance that will require the earlier recognition of credit losses
on loans and other financial instruments based on an expected loss model,
replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. Under the new
guidance, an entity will measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments
held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions
and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The expected loss model will apply to
loans and leases, unfunded lending commitments, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt
securities and other debt instruments measured at amortized cost. The
impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities will require the
recognition of credit losses through a valuation allowance when fair value is
less than amortized cost, regardless of whether the impairment is considered to
be other-than-temporary. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2020, with
early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new accounting guidance  .    

In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that
simplifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2017, with early adoption
permitted. The Company does not expect the provisions of this new accounting
guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.   

In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that
requires substantially all leases to be recorded as assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet. This new accounting guidance is effective on January 1, 2019,
with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company will record a right
of use asset and a lease payment obligation associated with arrangements
previously accounted for as operating leases. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new accounting guidance on its
consolidated financial position.   

In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on
recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance makes
targeted changes to existing Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
including, among other provisions, requiring certain equity investments to be
measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings and
requiring changes

in instrument-specific credit risk.
The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect
the provisions of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position or results of operations.   

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to clarify
the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. This new
accounting guidance is effective on January 1, 2018. The Company does not
expect the provisions of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact
on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.       

NOTE 2         RESTRICTED CASH     

The following table includes the composition of the Company s restricted
cash      :       

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank s
international banking entities, Oriental International Bank Inc. ( OIB ) and
Oriental Overseas, a division of the Bank, each held unencumbered certificates
of deposit in the amount of $        300         thousand as the legal reserve required for international
banking entities under Puerto Rico law. Each certificate of deposit cannot be
withdrawn by OIB or Oriental Overseas without prior written approval of the
Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico.   

As part of its derivative activities, the Company has entered into
collateral agreements with certain financial counterparties. At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had delivered $2.0 million of cash as
collateral for such derivatives activities.   

As part of the BBVA Acquisition, the Company assumed a contract
with FNMA which required collateral to guarantee the repurchase, if necessary,
of loans sold with recourse. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company delivered as collateral cash amounting to $1.1 million and $1.4
million, respectively.   

The Bank is required by Puerto Rico law to maintain average weekly
reserve balances to cover demand deposits. The amount of those minimum average
reserve balances for the week that covered September 30, 2016 was $  157.5   million (December 31, 2015
- $  148.3   million). At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank complied with such requirement. Cash and
due from bank as well as other short-term, highly liquid securities are used to
cover the required average reserve balances.     

NOTE 3         INVESTMENT SECURITIES    

Money Market Investments     

The Company considers as cash equivalents all money market
instruments that are not pledged and that have maturities of three months or
less at the date of acquisition. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
money market instruments included as part of cash and cash equivalents amounted
to $5.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

Investment Securities     

The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, fair value,
and weighted average yield of the securities owned by the Company at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

      NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

The amortized cost and fair value of the Company s investment
securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown in the
next table.       Securities not due on a single contractual
maturity date, such as collateralized mortgage obligations, are classified in
the period of final contractual maturity. Expected maturities may differ from
contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

      NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

The Company, as part of its asset/liability management, may
purchase U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government-sponsored agency discount
notes close to their maturities as alternatives to cash deposits at
correspondent banks or as a short term vehicle to reinvest the proceeds of sale
transactions until investment securities with attractive yields can be purchased.     During the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016, the Company retained securitized Government National
Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) pools totaling $  71.8   million amortized cost, at
a yield of   2.99  % from its own
originations. Previously, the Company was selling all securitized GNMA pools.
The GNMA pools were sold until June 2015. During the first half of 2015, the
Company sold $63.5 million of available-for-sale GNMA certificates as part of
its recurring mortgage loan origination and securitization activities. These
sales did not realize any gains or losses during such period.     

During the     nine-month period ended September 30    , 2016, the Company sold $277.2 million of
mortgage-backed securities and $11.1 million of Puerto Rico government bonds,
and  recorded a net gain on sale of securities of $12.2 million. Among the 2016
sales, the Company sold all but one of the Puerto Rico government bonds it
held. The Company had other-than-temporary impairment charges on such

The
Company performs valuations of the investment securities on a monthly basis.
Moreover, the Company conducts quarterly reviews to identify and evaluate each
investment in an unrealized loss position for other-than-temporary impairment.
Any portion of a decline in value associated with credit loss is recognized in
the statements of operations with the remaining noncredit-related component
recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). A credit loss is determined by
assessing whether the amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered by
comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the
security, discounted at the rate equal to the yield used to accrete current and
prospective beneficial interest for the security. The shortfall of the present
value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized
cost basis is considered to be the  credit loss.  Other-than-temporary
impairment analysis is based on estimates that depend on market conditions and
are subject to further change over time. In addition, while the Company
believes that the methodology used to value these exposures is reasonable, the
methodology is subject to continuing refinement, including those made as a
result of market developments. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that
changes in estimates or conditions could result in the need to recognize
additional other-than-temporary impairment charges in the future.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

Most of the investments ($  76.2
  million, amortized
cost, or   94  %) with an unrealized loss
position at September 30, 2016 consist of securities issued or guaranteed by
the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies, all of which are
highly liquid securities that have a large and efficient secondary market.
Their aggregate losses and their variability from period to period are the
result of changes in market conditions, and not due to the repayment capacity
or creditworthiness of the issuers or guarantors of such securities.  

The remaining investments ($  4.7   million, amortized cost,
or   6  %) with an unrealized loss
position at September 30, 2016 consist of obligations issued or guaranteed by
the government of Puerto Rico and its public instrumentalities. The decline in
the market value of this security is mainly attributed to an increase in
volatility as a result of changes in market conditions that reflect the
significant economic and fiscal challenges that Puerto Rico is facing,
including the government's credit default, a protracted economic recession,
sizable government debt-service obligations and structural budget deficits,
high unemployment and a shrinking population.   

The only obligation issued or guaranteed by
the government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities held at the end of the third
quarter of 2016 by the Company was the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation
Authority ( PRHTA )   Teodoro Moscoso Bridge revenue bond. The pledged income of
this bond comes from gross revenues from Teodoro Moscoso Bridge operations.
Although PRHTA is included in the Puerto Rico Governor's executive order of
November 30, 2015 ordering the ' clawback  of certain government
revenues, the toll bridge revenues for the repayment of such bonds were not
subject to the  clawback.  All other Puerto Rico government securities
were sold during the first quarter of 2016. The PRHTA bond with a principal
amount of  $  4.6   million had an aggregate
fair value of $  4.1   million at   September 30, 2016   (  87  % of the bond's cost). The
discounted cash flow analysis for the investments showed a cumulative default probability
at maturity of   8.9  %, thus reflecting that it
is more likely than not that the bond will not default during its remaining
term. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that it is more likely
than not that it will recover all interest and principal invested in this
Puerto Rico government bond and is, therefore, not required to recognize a
credit loss as of September 30, 2016.   Also,
the Company s conclusion is based on the assessment of the specific source of
repayment of the outstanding bond, which continues to perform. PRHTA started
principal repayments on July 1, 2014. All scheduled principal and interest
payments to date have been collected. On July 1, 2016, the Company received the
scheduled principal payment of $  2.0
  million. The next payment
is due on July 1, 2017.   As a
result of the aforementioned analysis, no other-than-temporary losses were
recorded during the quarter ended   September
30, 2016  .   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
applied a discounted cash flow analysis to the bond guaranteed by the
government of Puerto Rico to calculate the cash flows expected to be collected
and determine if any portion of the decline in market value of these
investments was considered an other-than-temporary impairment. The analysis
derives an estimate of value based on the present value of risk-adjusted future
cash flows of the underlying investments, and included the following components:  

The contractual future
cash flows of the bonds are projected based on the key terms as set forth in
the official statements for each investment. Such key terms include among
others the interest rate, amortization schedule, if any, and maturity date.  

The risk-adjusted cash
flows are calculated based on a monthly default probability and recovery rate
assumptions based on the credit rating of each investment. Constant monthly
default rates are assumed throughout the life of the bonds which are based on
the respective security s credit rating as of the date of the analysis.  

The adjusted future
cash flows are then discounted at the original effective yield of each
investment based on the purchase price and expected risk-adjusted future cash
flows as of the purchase date of each investment.

NOTE 4      -    LOANS     

The Company s loan portfolio held for
investment is composed of two segments, loans initially accounted for under the
amortized cost method (referred to as  originated and other  loans)
and loans acquired (referred to as  acquired  loans). Acquired loans
are further segregated between acquired BBVAPR loans and acquired Eurobank
loans. Acquired Eurobank loans were purchased subject to loss-sharing
agreements with the FDIC.   The FDIC loss-share
coverage related to commercial and other-non single family acquired Eurobank
loans expired     on June
30, 2015    .     Notwithstanding the
expiration of loss share coverage of commercial loans, on July 2, 2015, the
Company entered into an agreement with the FDIC pursuant to which the FDIC
concurred with a potential sale of a pool of loss-share assets covered under
the commercial loss-sharing agreement. Pursuant to such agreement, and as
further discussed below, the FDIC agreed to and paid $20 million in loss share
coverage with respect to the aggregate loss resulting from any portfolio sale
within 120 days of the agreement. This sale was completed on September 28, 2015    . Covered loans are no longer a
material amount. Therefore, the Company changed its loan disclosures during
2015. Loans held for sale are presented separately.      

The coverage for the single family residential loans will expire
on June 30, 2020    . At     September
30, 2016    , the remaining covered loans, amounting to $  62.8   million, net carrying amount
($    75.0     million gross amount), are
included as part of acquired Eurobank loans under the name  loans secured
by 1-4 family residential properties.  At     December 31, 2015    , covered loans amounted to $    67.2     million, net carrying
amount ($  92.3   million gross amount).     Interest income recognized for
covered loans during the nine-month periods ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015       was $  6.4   million and $  31.4   million, respectively.   The decrease in interest income recognized for covered
loans is mainly due to the expiration of the FDIC loss-share coverage related
to commercial and other-non single family residential loans     on June 30, 2015.         

Effective June 30, 2016, pursuant to supervisory
direction, the Company changed the purchase credit impaired policy for all
loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 (   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired
with Deteriorated Credit Quality   ). Under the revised policy, the Company
writes-off the loan s recorded investment and derecognizes the associated
allowance for loan and lease losses for loans that exit the acquired pools. The
revised policy was implemented prospectively due to the immaterial impact of
retrospective adoption. Prior to June 30, 2016, the pool s carrying value and
allowance was determined by discounting expected cash flows at the pool s
effective yield. The allowance for loan and lease losses was maintained until
all of the loans in the pool were paid off or charged-off.  The transition to
this revised policy during the second quarter of 2016 resulted in the
de-recognition of $  8.9   million and $  73.1   million in the recorded
investment balance and associated allowance for loans that had exited the
pools, for acquired BBVAPR loans and acquired Eurobank loans, respectively,
with no impact to the provision for loan and lease losses. Refer to Note 5
Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses    .         

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an
agreement to sell its outstanding $      200.0       million participation in the     Puerto Rico Electric Power
Authority ( PREPA )    
line of credit for $  123.5   million, slightly lower
than the adjusted book balance, net of reserves. As a result of this
transaction, the Company recognized a $56.2 million charge-off and $2.9 million
provision for loan and lease losses during the quarter ended September 30,
2016. At September 30, 2016, this line of credit was reported as other loans
held for sale, at fair value of $123.1 million. The sale transaction settled on
October 7, 2016.

During 2015, the Company changed its early delinquency reporting
on mortgage loans from one scheduled payment due to two scheduled payments due
to be comparable with local peers, except for troubled-debt restructured loans
which continue using one scheduled payment due for delinquency reporting.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company changed its early
delinquency reporting on consumer and auto loans from one scheduled payment due
to two scheduled payments to report consistently its retail portfolio. The
change resulted in a $      19       thousand and $  5.9
  million reduction in
early and total delinquency for consumer and auto loans, respectively.   

At     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had carrying
balances of $  136.8   million and $  334.6   million, respectively, in originated

Acquired loans were initially measured at fair value and

BBVAPR and Eurobank.   

Acquired BBVAPR Loans       

Accounted for under ASC 310-20 (Loans with

Credit cards, retail and commercial revolving lines of credits,
floor plans and performing auto loans with FICO scores over 660 acquired at a
premium    ,     excluding the acquired Eurobank loan
portfolio, are accounted for under the guidance of ASC 310-20, which requires
that any contractually required loan payment receivable in excess of the
Company s initial investment in the loans be accreted into interest income on a
level-yield basis over the life of the loan. Loans accounted for under ASC
310-20 are placed on non-accrual status when past due in accordance with the
Company s non-accrual policy, and any accretion of discount or amortization of
premium is discontinued. Acquired BBVAPR loans that were accounted for under
the provisions of ASC 310-20 are removed from the acquired loan category at the
end of the reporting period upon refinancing, renewal or normal
re-underwriting.

Loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 are excluded from the
above table as they are considered to be performing due to the application of
the accretion method, in which these loans will accrete interest income over
the remaining life of the loans using estimated cash flow analyses or are
accounted for under the cost recovery method.   

Delinquent residential mortgage loans insured or guaranteed under
applicable Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) and U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) programs are classified as non-performing
loans when they become 90 days or more past due, but are not placed in
non-accrual status until they become 18 months or more past due, since they are
insured loans. Therefore, these loans are included as non-performing loans but
excluded from non-accrual loans. In addition, these loans are excluded from the
impairment analysis.   

During the first quarter of 2015, the participation in the PREPA
line of credit was classified as non-accrual. At December 31, 2015, this participation
had an unpaid principal balance of $  190.3
  million. During the
third quarter of 2016, the Company agreed to sell its participation with a

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans whose terms

restructurings. The valuation allowance for impaired commercial loans amounted
to $  5.6   million at September 30,
2016 and $  55.9   million at December 31,
2015.  The valuation allowance for impaired commercial loans at December 31,

accounted for under ASC 310-20 into risk categories based on relevant
information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as
economic conditions, portfolio risk characteristics, prior loss experience, and
the results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans.   

The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:   

Pass:      Loans classified as  pass  have a well-defined primary
source of repayment very likely to be sufficient, with no apparent risk, strong
financial position, minimal operating risk, profitability, liquidity and
capitalization better than industry standards.   

Special Mention:      Loans classified as  special mention 
have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left
uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the
repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at
some future date.   

Substandard:      Loans classified as  substandard  are
inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a
well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the
debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution
will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.   

Doubtful:      Loans classified as  doubtful  have all
the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added
characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on
the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, questionable and
improbable.   

Loss:      Loans classified as  loss  are considered uncollectible
and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not
warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no
recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to
defer writing off this worthless loan even though partial recovery may be
effected in the future.   

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed
individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass
rated loans.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company had outstanding credit facilities held for investment of approximately
$  202.4   million and $  415.4   million, respectively,
granted to the Puerto Rico government, including its instrumentalities, public
corporations and municipalities, included within the portfolios of originated
and other loans and acquired BBVAPR loans accounted for under ASC 310-30.     A substantial portion of the Company s
credit exposure to Puerto Rico s government consists of collateralized loans or
obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues identified for
their repayment. Approximately $  191.2   million of these loans are
general obligations of municipalities secured by    ad valorem    taxation,
without limitation as to rate or amount, on all taxable property within the
issuing municipalities.  The good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of
each issuing municipality are pledged for the payment of its general
obligations.     

At     September 30,
2016    , we had approximately
$  11.2   million of credit
facilities to central government and public corporations of the Commonwealth,
consisting of a participation in a loan to the Puerto Rico Housing Finance
Authority ( PRHFA ) with an outstanding balance of $  10.9   million to be repaid from
abandoned or unclaimed funds at financial institutions that revert to the
government under a Puerto Rico escheat law. The loan to PRHFA defaulted on an
annual principal payment in the third quarter of 2016.   

The outstanding balance of credit facilities to the central
government and public corporations decreased by $  200.8   million during 2016 mainly
as a result of the sale of the PREPA fuel line of credit which had an
outstanding balance of $190.3 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30,
2016, this fuel line of credit was reported as othe    r loans held for sale, at fair value. The
sale settled on October 7, 2016.

NOTE 5   ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES    

The composition of the Company s allowance
for loan and lease losses at     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015     was as follows    :         

The Company maintains an allowance for loan and lease
losses at a level that management considers adequate to provide for probable
losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks. The Company s
allowance for loan and lease losses policy provides for a detailed quarterly
analysis of probable losses. The analysis includes a review of historical loan
loss experience, value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions,
financial condition of borrowers and other pertinent factors. While management
uses available information in estimating probable loan losses, future additions
to the allowance may be required based on factors beyond the Company s control.
We also maintain an allowance for loan losses on acquired loans when: (i) for
loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality
subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20,
the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining credit discount recorded
at the time of acquisition.

Effective June 30, 2016,
pursuant to supervisory direction, the Company revised its purchase credit
impaired policy for all loans accounted for under ASC 310-30. Under the revised
policy, the Company writes-off the loan s recorded investment and derecognizes
the associated allowance for loan and lease losses for loans that exit the
pools. The revised policy was implemented prospectively due to the immaterial
impact of retrospective adoption. Prior to June 30, 2016, the pool s carrying
value and allowance was determined by discounting expected cash flows at the
pool s effective yield. The allowance for loa  n and
lease losses was maintained until all of the loans in the pool were paid off or
charged-off. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company
de-recognized $8.9 million and $73.1 million in the recorded investment balance
and associated allowance for loans that had exited the pools for acquired
BBVAPR loans and acquired Eurobank loans, respectively, with no impact to the
provision for loan and lease losses.

The FDIC shared-loss portion of provision for acquired Eurobank

covered under the FDIC loss-share agreement which is increasing the FDIC
loss-share indemnification asset.         

The FDIC loss sharing obligation, related to
commercial and other-non single family acquired Eurobank loans expired on June
30, 2015.     The coverage for
the single family residential loans will expire on June 30, 2020    . The remaining
covered loans are included as part of acquired Eurobank loans under the name
 loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties.      At     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015    , allowance for loan losses on loans
covered by the FDIC shared-loss agreement amounted to $  12.3   million and $  22.6   million, respectively. The

NOTE 6- FDIC
INDEMNIFICATION ASSET, TRUE-UP PAYMENT OBLIGATION, AND FDIC SHARED-LOSS EXPENSE    

In connection with the FDIC-assisted acquisition, the Bank and the
FDIC entered into shared-loss agreements pursuant to which the FDIC covers a
substantial portion of any losses on loans (and related unfunded loan
commitments), foreclosed real estate and other repossessed properties covered
by the agreements.   

The acquired loans, foreclosed real estate, and other repossessed
properties subject to the shared-loss agreements are collectively referred to
as  covered assets.  Under the terms of the shared-loss agreements, the FDIC
absorbs   80  % of losses and shares in   80  % of loss recoveries on
covered assets. The term of the shared-loss agreement covering single family
residential mortgage loans is ten years with respect to losses and loss
recoveries, while the term of the shared-loss agreement covering commercial
loans is five years with respect to losses and eight years with respect to loss
recoveries, from the end of the quarter of the acquisition. The coverage under
the commercial shared-loss agreement expired on June 30, 2015. The shared-loss
agreements also provide for certain costs directly related to the collection
and preservation of covered assets to be reimbursed at an 80% level. The FDIC
indemnification asset represents the portion of estimated losses covered by the
shared-loss agreements between the Bank and the FDIC.   

The following table presents the activity in the FDIC
indemnification asset and true-up payment obligation for the quarters and
nine-month periods ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015    :       

The FDIC shared-loss expense
bears an inverse relationship with a change in the yield of covered loan pools
in accordance with ASC 310-30. ASC 310-30 dictates that such pools should be
subject to increases in their yield when the present value of the expected cash
flows is higher than the pool s carrying balance. When the increases in cash
flow expectations are driven by reductions in the expected credit losses, the
Bank recognizes that such losses are no longer expected to be collected from
the FDIC. Accordingly, the Bank reduces the FDIC indemnification asset by
amortizing the reduction in expected collections throughout the remaining life
of the underlying pools. This amortization is recognized in the FDIC
shared-loss expense account.    

The underlying factors that caused an
increase in the expected cash flows and resulting reduction in projected losses
are derived from the pool-level cash flow forecasts. Credit loss assumptions
used to develop each pool-level cash flow forecast are based on the behavior of
defaults, recoveries and losses of the corresponding pool of covered loans.

      NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

The FDIC
indemnification asset shared-loss expense for the quarters ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015          amounted to $1.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
The expense for the nine-month periods ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015          amounted to of $6.2 million and $35.9 million,
respectively.     The FDIC
loss-share coverage for the commercial loans was in effect until June 30, 2015.
Accordingly, the Company amortized the remaining portion of the FDIC
indemnification asset attributable to non-single family loans at the close of
the second quarter of 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
FDIC indemnification asset reflects only the balance for single family
residential mortgage loans.   

The Company has owed payments
to the FDIC for the recovery of prior claims for non-single family loans. At     September 30, 2016  , the liability for these payments amounted to $  278   thousand and is recorded in
other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition until
cash is paid to the FDIC. There was no liability at   September 30, 2015  .    

Also in connection with the FDIC-assisted acquisition, the Bank
agreed to make a true-up payment, also known as clawback liability or clawback
provision, to the FDIC on the date that is 45 days following the last day (such
day, the  True-Up Measurement Date ) of the final shared-loss month, or upon
the final disposition of all covered assets under the shared-loss agreements in
the event losses thereunder fail to reach expected levels. Under the
shared-loss agreements, the Bank will pay to the FDIC 50% of the excess, if
any, of: (i) 20% of the Intrinsic Loss Estimate of $906.0 million (or $181.2
million) (as determined by the FDIC) less (ii) the sum of: (A) 25% of the asset
discount (per bid) (or $227.5 million); plus (B) 25% of the cumulative
shared-loss payments (defined as the aggregate of all of the payments made or
payable to the Bank minus the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable
to the FDIC); plus (C) the sum of the period servicing amounts for every
consecutive twelve-month period prior to and ending on the True-Up Measurement
Date in respect of each of the shared-loss agreements during which the
shared-loss provisions of the applicable shared-loss agreement is in effect
(defined as the product of the simple average of the principal amount of
shared-loss loans and shared-loss assets at the beginning and end of such
period times 1%). The estimated liability is included within accrued expenses
and other liabilities in the unaudited consolidated statements of financial condition.   

This true-up payment obligation may increase if actual and
expected losses decline. The Company measures the true-up payment obligation at
fair value. The changes in fair value are included as a change in true-up
payment obligation within the FDIC shared-loss expense, net, in the unaudited
consolidated statements of operations.   

The following table provides the fair value and the undiscounted
amount of the true-up payment obligation at September 30, 2016 and December 31,

NOTE 7           DERIVATIVES      

The following table presents the Company s derivative assets and
liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       

Interest Rate Swaps     

The Company enters into interest rate swap
contracts to hedge the variability of future interest cash flows of forecasted
wholesale borrowings attributable to changes in a predetermined variable index
rate. The interest rate swaps effectively fix the Company s interest payments
on an amount of forecasted interest expense attributable to the variable index
rate corresponding to the swap notional stated rate. These swaps are designated
as cash flow hedges for the forecasted wholesale borrowing transactions, are
properly documented as such, and therefore, qualify for cash flow hedge
accounting. Any gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash
flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and is
subsequently reclassified into operations in the period during which the hedged
forecasted transactions affect earnings. Changes in the fair value of these
derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income to the
extent there is no significant ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedging
relationships. Currently, the Company does not expect to reclassify any amount
included in other comprehensive income (loss) related to these interest rate
swaps to operations in the next twelve months.     

The following table shows a summary of these swaps and their terms
at September 30, 2016:       

An accumulated unrealized loss of $        2.8         million and $  4.3
  million was
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the valuation
of these swaps at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and
the related liability is being reflected in the accompanying unaudited
consolidated statements of financial condition.   

At     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015    , interest rate swaps not designated as
hedging instruments that were offered to clients represented an asset of $1.5
million and $1.8 million, respectively, and were included as part of derivative
assets in the unaudited consolidated statements of financial position. The
credit risk to these clients stemming from these derivatives, if any, is not
material. At     September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015    , interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments that
are the mirror-images of the derivatives offered to clients represented a
liability of $1.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and were included as
part of derivative liabilities in the unaudited consolidated statements of
financial condition.

The following table shows a summary of
these interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments and their terms
at September 30, 2016:       

Interest Rate Caps     

The Company has entered into interest rate
cap transactions with various clients with floating-rate debt who wish to
protect their financial results against increases in interest rates. In these
cases, the Company simultaneously enters into mirror-image interest rate cap
transactions with financial counterparties. None of these cap transactions
qualify for hedge accounting, and therefore, they are marked to market through earnings.
    As of     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015    , t    he outstanding total notional amount of
interest rate caps was $  124.4   million and $  109.8   million, respectively. At     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the interest rate caps sold to clients represented a liability of $22 thousand
and $32 thousand, respectively, and were included as part of derivative
liabilities in the unaudited consolidated statements of financial condition. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the interest rate caps purchased as
mirror-images represented an asset of $22 thousand and $32 thousand,
respectively, and were included as part of derivative assets in the unaudited consolidated
statements of financial condition.     

Options Tied to Standard   Poor s 500 Stock Market Index           

In the past, the Company offered its
customers certificates of deposit with an option tied to the performance of the
S P 500 Index. The Company used option agreements with major broker-dealers
to manage its exposure to changes in this index. Under the terms of the option agreements,
the Company received the average increase in the month-end value of the index
in exchange for a fixed premium. The changes in fair value of the option
agreements used to manage the exposure in the stock market in the certificates
of deposit were recorded in earnings. At September 30, 2016  there were no
transactions outstanding.  At December 31, 2015, the purchased options used to
manage exposure to the S P 500 Index on stock indexed deposits represented
an asset of $1.2 million (notional amount of $  3.4   million), and the options
sold to customers embedded in the certificates of deposit and recorded as
deposits in the unaudited consolidated statements of financial condition,
represented a liability of $  1.1   million (notional amount of
$    3.2    
million).

NOTE 13           INCOME TAXES    

At     September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s     net deferred tax asset amounted to $131.1
million and $145.9 million, respectively. In assessing the realizability of the
deferred tax asset, management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment.  Based upon the level of
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the
periods in which the deferred tax asset are deductible, management believes it
is more likely than not that the Company will realize the deferred tax asset,
net of any existing valuation allowances recorded at     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015    . The amount of the deferred
tax asset that is considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if
estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 OIB, the Bank s
international banking entity subsidiary, had $  117   thousand and $  141   thousand, respectively, in
income tax effect of unrecognized gain on available-for-sale securities
included in other comprehensive income. Following the change in OIB s
applicable tax rate from 5% to 0% as a result of a Puerto Rico law adopted in
2011, this remaining tax balance will flow through income as these securities
are repaid or sold in future periods. During the quarters ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, $  9   thousand and $  11   thousand, respectively,
related to this residual tax effect from OIB was reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income into income tax provision. During the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $  24   thousand and $  33   thousand, respectively,
related to this residual tax effect from OIB was reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income into income tax provision.     

The Company classifies unrecognized tax
benefits in other liabilities. These gross unrecognized tax benefits would
affect the effective tax rate if realized. The balance of unrecognized tax
benefits was $      2.0       million at September 30, 2016 and $  2.2   million at December 31,
2015. The Company had accrued $  112   thousand at September 30,
2016 and $  175   thousand at December 31,
2015 for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax
benefits. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company increased
unrecognized tax benefits by $  1.1   million and released $  1.3   million due to the
expiration of the statute of limitations.   

Income tax
expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3.6 million and
$562 thousand, respectively. Income tax expense for the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $15.1 million and $2.3 million,
respectively.

NOTE 14        
REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS              

Regulatory Capital Requirements     

The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to
various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and Puerto Rico
banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate
certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators
that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s
financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet
specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets,
liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject
to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings,
and other factors.    

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking regulators     have adopted new capital rules that became
effective January 1, 2015 for the Company and the Bank (subject to certain
phase-in periods through January 1, 2019) and that replaced their general
risk-based capital rules, advanced approaches rule, market risk rule, and
leverage rules. Among other matters, the new capital rules: (i) introduce a new
capital measure called  Common Equity Tier 1  ( CET1 ) and related regulatory
capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital
consists of CET1 and  Additional Tier 1 capital  instruments meeting certain revised
requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory
capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital;
and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as
compared to prior regulations.     The new capital rules prescribe a new standardized approach for
risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four
Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more
risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, and
resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes.   

Pursuant to the new
capital rules, the minimum capital ratios requirements as of January 1, 2015
are as follows:   

                4.5%
CET1 to risk-weighted assets;   

                6.0%
Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1    plus    Additional Tier 1 capital) to
risk-weighted assets;   

                8.0%
Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital    plus    Tier 2 capital) to
risk-weighted assets; and   

                4.0% Tier
1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial
statements (known     

                as the
 leverage ratio ).   

As of     September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015    ,
the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they
are subject. As of     September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015    ,
the Bank is  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt
corrective action. To be categorized as  well capitalized,  an institution must
maintain minimum CET1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and Tier
1 leverage ratios as set forth in the tables presented below.   

The New Capital Rules also introduce a new 2.5%  capital
conservation buffer , composed entirely of CET1, on top of the three minimum risk-weighted
asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses
during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to
risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation
buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation
based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1,
2019, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain such an additional
capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum
ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital
to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to
risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. The implementation of the capital
conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increase
by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1,
2019. At     September
30, 2016     the Company and the
Bank met the capital buffer requirement.

Additional
Paid-in Capital     

Additional paid-in capital represents contributed capital in
excess of par value of common and preferred stock net of the costs of issuance.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 accumulated issuance costs charged
against additional paid-in capital amounted to $    13.6     million and $    10.1     million for preferred and
common stock, respectively.     

Legal Surplus     

The Puerto Rico Banking Act requires that
a minimum of 10% of the Bank s net income for the year be transferred to a
reserve fund until such fund (legal surplus) equals the total paid-in capital
on common and preferred stock. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,          the Bank s legal surplus amounted to $  74.8   million and $  70.4   million, respectively. The
amount transferred to the legal surplus account is not available for the
payment of dividends to shareholders.     

Treasury Stock     

Under the Company s current stock
repurchase program it is authorized to purchase in the open market up to $  70   million of its outstanding
shares of common stock, of which approximately $    7.7     million
of authority remains. The shares of common stock repurchased are to be held by
the Company as treasury shares. There were no repurchases during the nine-month
period ended     September 30,
2016. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company
purchased   803,985   shares under this program
for a total of $  8.9   million at an average price
of $  11.10   per share.   

The number of shares that may yet be purchased
under the $70 million program is estimated at         764,674         and was calculated by dividing the
remaining balance of $  7.7   million by $    10.11     (closing price of the
Company common stock at     September 30, 2016    ). The Company did not purchase any shares of its common
stock during the nine-month period ended       September 30, 2016 and 2015, other than
through its publicly announced stock purchase program.     

The activity in connection with common shares held in

NOTE 17   EARNINGS (LOSS) PER
COMMON SHARE    

The calculation of earnings (loss) per common share for the quarters
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:       

In computing diluted earnings (loss) per common share, the           84,000           shares of convertible preferred stock,
which remain outstanding at September 30, 2016, with a conversion rate, subject
to certain conditions, of   86.4225   shares of common stock per
share, were included as average potential common shares from the date they were
issued and outstanding. Moreover, in computing diluted earnings (loss) per
common share, the dividends declared during the quarters ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 on the convertible preferred stock were added back as income
available to common shareholders.    

For the quarters ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015    , weighted-average stock options with an
anti-dilutive effect on earnings (loss) per share not included in the
calculation amounted to   927,069       and   973,200      , respectively.          For the nine-month periods ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015, weighted-average
stock options with an anti-dilutive effect on earnings (loss) per share not
included in the calculation amounted to   957,670   and   648,563,   respectively.     

NOTE 18   GUARANTEES    

   At
September 30, 2016, the unamortized balance of the obligations undertaken in
issuing the guarantees under standby letters of credit represented a liability
of $  2.4   million (December 31, 2015
- $  14.7   million).   

As a result
of the BBVAPR Acquisition, the Company assumed a liability for residential
mortgage loans sold subject to credit recourse pursuant to FNMA s residential
mortgage loan sales and securitization programs. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans
sold subject to credit recourse was $    20.4     million and $    22.4     million, respectively.

      NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

The following table shows the changes in the Company s
liability for estimated losses from these credit recourse agreements, included
in the unaudited consolidated statements of financial condition during the
quarters and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.        

The
estimated losses to be absorbed under the credit recourse arrangements were
recorded as a liability when the credit recourse was assumed, and are updated
on a quarterly basis. The expected loss, which represents the amount expected
to be lost on a given loan, considers the probability of default and loss
severity. The probability of default represents the probability that a loan in
good standing would become 120 days delinquent, in which case the Company is
obligated to repurchase the loan. The recourse obligation will be fully
extinguished before the end of 2017.    

If a borrower defaults, pursuant to the credit recourse
provided, the Company is required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third
party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future
payments that the Company would be required to make under the recourse
arrangements is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential
mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During the
quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased
approximately $  133   thousand and $  421   thousand, respectively of
unpaid principal balance in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse
provisions.  During the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2015,
the Company repurchased approximately $  165   thousand and $  3.4   million, respectively of
unpaid principal balance in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse
provisions.  If a borrower defaults, the Company has rights to the underlying
collateral securing the mortgage loan. The Company suffers losses on these
mortgage loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the collateral
property are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan, any uncollected
interest advanced, and the costs of holding and disposing the related property.
At September 30, 2016, the Company s liability for estimated credit losses
related to loans sold with credit recourse amounted to $  191   thousand (December 31,
2015  $  439   thousand).     

When the Company sells or securitizes mortgage loans, it generally
makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of
the loans sold. The Company's mortgage operations division groups conforming
mortgage loans into pools which are exchanged for FNMA and GNMA mortgage-backed
securities that are generally sold to private investors, or are sold directly
to FNMA or other private investors for cash. As required under such mortgage
backed securities programs, quality review procedures are performed by the
Company to ensure that asset guideline qualifications are met. To the extent
the loans do not meet specified characteristics, the Company may be required to
repurchase such loans or indemnify for losses and bear any subsequent loss related
to the loans. During the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company repurchased $      791       thousand and $  3.1
  million,
respectively, of unpaid principal balance in mortgage loans, excluding mortgage
loans subject to credit recourse provisions referred to above.     During the quarter and nine-month period ended September
30, 2015, the Company repurchased $  7.7
  million and $  19.5   million, respectively, of
unpaid principal balance in mortgage loans, excluding mortgage loans subject to
credit recourse provisions referred to above.   

During the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company recognized $  202   thousand and $  313   thousand, respectively, in
losses from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans sold subject to credit
recourse, and $  208   thousand and $  1.0   million, respectively, in
losses from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans as a result of
breaches of the customary representations and warranties. During the quarter
and nine -month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized $      418       thousand and $    1.0     million, respectively, in
losses from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans sold subject to credit
recourse, and $    500     thousand and $  2.0   million, respectively, in
losses from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans as a result of
breaches of the customary representations and warranties.

Servicing agreements relating to the
mortgage-backed securities programs of FNMA and GNMA, and to mortgage loans
sold or serviced to certain other investors, including the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ), require the Company to advance funds to make
scheduled payments of principal, interest, taxes and insurance, if such
payments have not been received from the borrowers. At September 30, 2016, the
Company serviced $  752.5   million in mortgage loans
for third-parties. The Company generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to
these arrangements from the mortgage owner, from liquidation proceeds when the
mortgage loan is foreclosed or, in the case of FHA/VA loans, under the
applicable FHA and VA insurance and guarantees programs. However, in the
meantime, the Company must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the
time the advance is outstanding. The Company must also bear the costs of
attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans. In addition,
if a defaulted loan is not cured, the mortgage loan would be canceled as part
of the foreclosure proceedings and the Company would not receive any future
servicing income with respect to that loan. At September 30, 2016, the
outstanding balance of funds advanced by the Company under such mortgage loan
servicing agreements was approximately $  330   thousand (December 31,
2015 - $  301   thousand). To the extent
the mortgage loans underlying the Company's servicing portfolio experience
increased delinquencies, the Company would be required to dedicate additional
cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur
additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts.     

NOTE 19         
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

Loan Commitments     

In the normal course of
business, the Company becomes a party to credit-related financial instruments
with off-balance-sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby and commercial
letters of credit, and financial guarantees. Those instruments involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the
amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The
contract or notional amount of those instruments reflects the extent of the
Company s involvement in particular types of financial instruments.   

   The Company s exposure to
credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the
financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, including commitments
under credit card arrangements, and commercial letters of credit is represented
by the contractual notional amounts of those instruments, which do not
necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. In addition, the
measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only
when all related and offsetting transactions are identified. The Company uses
the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as
it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.   

     Credit-related financial
instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:       

Commitments to extend credit represent agreements to
lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates
or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company
evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount
of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company upon the extension
of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty.   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
commitments to extend credit consisted mainly of undisbursed available amounts
on commercial lines of credit, construction loans, and revolving credit card arrangements.
Since many of the unused commitments are expected to expire unused or be only
partially used, the total amount of these unused commitments does not
necessarily represent future cash requirements.     These lines of credit had a reserve of $    667     thousand at both   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

      NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

Commercial letters of credit
are issued or confirmed to guarantee payment of customers  payables or
receivables in short-term international trade transactions. Generally, drafts
will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as intended.
However, the short-term nature of this instrument serves to mitigate the risk
associated with these contracts.   

The summary of instruments that are considered
financial guarantees in accordance with the authoritative guidance related to
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including
indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others, at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, is as follows:       

Standby letters of credit and
financial guarantees are written conditional commitments issued by the Company
to guarantee the payment and/or performance of a customer to a third party
( beneficiary ). If the customer fails to comply with the agreement, the
beneficiary may draw on the standby letter of credit or financial guarantee as
a remedy. The amount of credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit in the
event of nonperformance is the face amount of the letter of credit or financial
guarantee. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar
transactions. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by
the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit
evaluation of the customer.      

       Lease Commitments      

The Company has entered into various
operating lease agreements for branch facilities and administrative offices.
Rent expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounted to $      2.0       million and $  2.3   million, respectively. For
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, rent expense amounted
to $  6.5   million and $  7.0   million, respectively, and
is included in the  occupancy and equipment  caption in the unaudited
consolidated statements of operations.   Future rental commitments under leases
in effect at September 30, 2016 exclusive of taxes, insurance, and maintenance
expenses payable by the Company, are summarized as follows:

Contingencies     

The Company and its
subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings incidental to
their business. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its
subsidiaries are also subject to governmental and regulatory examinations.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company, including the Bank (and its subsidiary
OIB), Oriental Financial Services, and Oriental Insurance, are subject to
regulation by various U.S., Puerto Rico and other regulators.    

   The Company seeks to
resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes
is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and contests
allegations of liability or wrongdoing and, where applicable, the amount of damages
or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending
matter.    

   Subject to the accounting
and disclosure framework under the provisions of ASC 450, it is the opinion of
the Company s management, based on current knowledge and after taking into
account its current legal accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters
would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
statements of financial condition of the Company. Nonetheless, given the
substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and
the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of
these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the
Company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular
quarterly or annual periods. The Company has evaluated all litigation and
regulatory matters where the likelihood of a potential loss is deemed
reasonably possible. The Company has determined that the estimate of the reasonably
possible loss is not significant.     

NOTE 20      -
   FAIR VALUE       OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    

The Company follows the fair value measurement framework under
GAAP.   

Fair Value Measurement     

The fair value measurement framework defines fair value as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. This framework also establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.    

Money market investments     

The fair value of money market investments is based on the
carrying amounts reflected in the unaudited consolidated statements of
financial condition as these are reasonable estimates of fair value given the
short-term nature of the instruments.   

Investment securities     

The fair value of investment securities is based on quoted market
prices, when available, or market prices provided by Interactive Data
Corporation ( IDC ), an independent, well-recognized pricing company. Such
securities are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 depending on the basis for
determining fair value. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair
value is based upon externally developed models that use both observable and
unobservable inputs depending on the market activity of the instrument, and
such securities are classified as Level 3. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company did not have investment securities classified as Level 3.   

Derivative instruments     

The fair value of the interest rate swaps is largely a function of
the financial market s expectations regarding the future direction of interest
rates. Accordingly, current market values are not necessarily indicative of the
future impact of derivative instruments on earnings. This will depend, for the
most part, on the shape of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, as
well as the expectations for rates in the future. The fair value of most of
these derivative instruments is based on observable market parameters, which
include discounting the instruments  cash flows using the U.S. dollar
LIBOR-based discount rates, and also applying yield curves that account for the
industry sector and the credit rating of the counterparty and/or the Company.   

73       

OFG
BANCORP      

      NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

Certain other derivative instruments with limited market activity
are valued using externally developed models that consider unobservable market
parameters. Based on their valuation methodology, derivative instruments are
classified as Level 2 or Level 3. In the past, the Company offered its
customers certificates of deposit with an option tied to the performance of the
S P Index and used equity indexed option agreements with major
broker-dealers to manage its exposure to changes in this index. Their fair value
was obtained through the use of an external based valuation that was thoroughly
evaluated and adopted by management as its measurement tool for these options.
The payoff of these options was linked to the average value of the S P
Index on a specific set of dates during the life of the option. The methodology
used an average rate option or a cash-settled option whose payoff was based on
the difference between the expected average value of the S P Index during
the remaining life of the option and the strike price at inception. The
assumptions, which were uncertain and required a degree of judgment, included
primarily S P Index volatility, forward interest rate projections,
estimated index dividend payout, and leverage. At September 30, 2016  there
were no transaction outstanding.   

Servicing assets     

Servicing assets do not trade in an active market with readily
observable prices. Servicing assets are priced using a discounted cash flow
model. The valuation model considers servicing fees, portfolio characteristics,
prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary
revenues, cost to service and other economic factors. Due to the unobservable
nature of certain valuation inputs, the servicing rights are classified as Level
3.   

Impaired Loans      

Impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future
cash flows using the loan s existing rate in a discounted cash flow
calculation, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral-dependent. Expected cash flows are based on internal inputs
reflecting expected default rates on contractual cash flows. This method of
estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price concept of fair value
described in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820-10 and would
generally result in a higher value than the exit-price approach. For loans
measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less costs to sell, fair
value is generally determined based     on the fair value of the collateral, which is derived from
appraisals that take into consideration prices in observed transactions
involving similar assets in similar locations, in accordance with the
provisions of ASC 310-10-35 less disposition costs. Currently, the associated
loans considered impaired are classified as Level 3.   

Foreclosed real estate     

Foreclosed real estate includes real estate properties securing
residential mortgage and commercial loans. The fair value of foreclosed real
estate may be determined using an external appraisal, broker price option or an
internal valuation. These foreclosed assets are classified as Level 3 given
certain internal adjustments that may be made to external appraisals.   

Other repossessed assets     

Other repossessed assets include repossessed automobiles. The fair
value of the repossessed automobiles may be determined using internal valuation
and an external appraisal. These repossessed assets are classified as Level 3
given certain internal adjustments that may be made to external appraisals.

Information
about Sensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs     

Derivative asset (S P Purchased Options)        The significant unobservable inputs
used in the fair value measurement of the Company s derivative assets related
to S P purchased options are implied option volatility and counterparty
credit risk. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would
result in a significantly different fair value measurement. Generally, a change
in the assumption used for implied option volatility is not necessarily
accompanied by directionally similar or opposite changes in the assumption used
for counterparty credit risk.    

    Servicing assets       
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the
Company s servicing assets are constant prepayment rates and discount rates.
Changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases
in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which may magnify or
offset the sensitivities. Mortgage banking activities, a component of total
banking and financial service revenue in the consolidated statements of
operations, include the changes from period to period in the fair value of the
mortgage loan servicing rights, which may result from changes in the valuation
model inputs or assumptions (principally reflecting changes in discount rates
and prepayment speed assumptions) and other changes, including changes due to
collection/realization of expected cash flows.    

    Derivative liability (S P Embedded Options)        The significant unobservable inputs
used in the fair value measurement of the Company s derivative liability
related to S P purchased options were implied option volatility and
counterparty credit risk. Significant changes in any of those inputs in
isolation would result in a significantly different fair value measurement.
Generally, a change in the assumption used for implied option volatility is not
necessarily accompanied by directionally similar or opposite changes in the
assumption used for counterparty credit risk.           

Fair Value of Financial Instruments     

The information about the estimated fair value of financial
instruments required by GAAP is presented hereunder. The aggregate fair value
amounts presented do not necessarily represent management s estimate of the
underlying value of the Company.   

The estimated fair value is subjective in nature, involves
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be
determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could affect these fair value
estimates. The fair value estimates do not take into consideration the value of
future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not financial
instruments. Other significant tangible and intangible assets that are not
considered financial instruments are the value of long-term customer
relationships of retail deposits, and premises and equipment.

      NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)      

The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of significant financial
instruments at     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015    :   

Cash and cash equivalents
(including money market investments and time deposits with other banks),
restricted cash, accrued interest receivable, accounts receivable and other
assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities have been valued at the carrying
amounts reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition as
these are reasonable estimates of fair value given the short-term nature of the
instruments.   

Investments in FHLB-NY
stock are valued at their redemption value.    

The fair value of
investment securities, including trading securities and other investments, is
based on quoted market prices, when available or prices provided from
contracted pricing providers, or market prices provided by recognized broker-dealers.
If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon externally
developed models that use both observable and unobservable inputs depending on
the market activity of the instrument.   

The fair value of the FDIC
indemnification asset represents the present value of the net estimated cash
payments expected to be received from the FDIC for future losses on covered
assets based on the credit assumptions on estimated cash flows for each covered
asset and the loss sharing percentages. The ultimate collectability of the FDIC
indemnification asset is dependent upon the performance of the underlying
covered loans, the passage of time and claims paid by the FDIC which are
impacted by the Bank s adherence to certain guidelines established by the FDIC.   

The fair value of servicing asset is estimated by using a
cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated
future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected
loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors,
which are determined based on current market conditions.   

The fair values of the derivative instruments are provided
by valuation experts and counterparties. Certain derivatives with limited
market activity are valued using externally developed models that consider
unobservable market parameters. In the past, the Company offered its customers
certificates of deposit with an option tied to the performance of the S P
Index and used equity indexed option agreements with major broker-dealers to
manage its exposure to changes in this index. Their fair value was obtained
through the use of an external based valuation that was thoroughly evaluated
and adopted by management as its measurement tool for these options. The payoff
of these options was linked to the average value of the S P Index on a
specific set of dates during the life of the option. The methodology used an
average rate option or a cash-settled option whose payoff was based on the
difference between the expected average value of the S P Index during the
remaining life of the option and the strike price at inception. The
assumptions, which were uncertain and required a degree of judgment, included
primarily S P Index volatility, forward interest rate projections,
estimated index dividend payout, and leverage. At September 30, 2016, there
were no transactions outstanding.   

Fair value of derivative liabilities, which include interest
rate swaps and forward-settlement swaps, are based on the net discounted value
of the contractual projected cash flows of both the pay-fixed receive-variable
legs of the contracts. The projected cash flows are based on the forward yield
curve, and discounted using current estimated market rates.   

The fair value of the loan portfolio (including loans
held-for-sale) is estimated by segregating by type, such as mortgage,
commercial, consumer, auto and leasing. Each loan segment is further segmented
into fixed and adjustable interest rates and by performing and non-performing
categories. The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting
contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayment estimates (voluntary and
involuntary), if any, using estimated current market discount rates that reflect
the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan. This fair value is not
currently an indication of an exit price as that type of assumption could
result in a different fair value estimate. Non-performing loans have been
valued at the carrying amounts.   

The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is
the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of
fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of the
contractual cash flows, using estimated current market discount rates for
deposits of similar remaining maturities.   

The fair value of long-term borrowings, which include
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, advances from FHLB,
subordinated capital notes, and other long term borrowings is based on the
discounted value of the contractual cash flows using current estimated market
discount rates for borrowings with similar terms, remaining maturities and put
dates.

NOTE 21           BUSINESS       SEGMENTS         

The Company segregates its businesses into the following
major reportable segments of business: Banking, Wealth Management, and
Treasury. Management established the reportable segments based on the internal
reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate
resources. Other factors such as the Company s organization, nature of its
products, distribution channels and economic characteristics of the products
were also considered in the determination of the reportable segments. The
Company measures the performance of these reportable segments based on
pre-established goals of different financial parameters such as net income, net
interest income, loan production, and fees generated. The Company s methodology
for allocating non-interest expenses among segments is based on several factors
such as revenue, employee headcount, occupied space, dedicated services or
time, among others. These factors are reviewed on a periodical basis and may
change if the conditions warrant.     

Banking includes the Bank s branches and traditional banking
products such as deposits and commercial, consumer and mortgage loans. Mortgage
banking activities are carried out by the Bank s mortgage banking division,
whose principal activity is to originate mortgage loans for the Company s own
portfolio. As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Company may sell
loans directly into the secondary market or securitize conforming loans into
mortgage-backed securities.   

Wealth Management is comprised of the Bank s trust division,
Oriental Financial Services, Oriental Insurance, and OPC. The core operations
of this segment are financial planning, money management and investment
banking, brokerage services, insurance sales activity, corporate and individual
trust and retirement services, as well as retirement plan administration
services.   

The Treasury segment encompasses all of the Company s
asset/liability management activities, such as purchases and sales of
investment securities, interest rate risk management, derivatives, and
borrowings. Intersegment sales and transfers, if any, are accounted for as if
the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market
prices.

ITEM 2.               MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

INTRODUCTION    

The
following discussion of the Company s financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with the  Selected Financial Data  and
the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes.
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Please see
 Forward-Looking   Statements  and the risk factors set forth in our
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ), for
discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these
statements.  

The
Company is a publicly-owned financial holding company that provides a full
range of banking and financial services through its subsidiaries, including
commercial, consumer, auto and mortgage lending; checking and savings accounts;
financial planning, insurance and securities brokerage services; and corporate
and individual trust and retirement services. The Company operates through
three major business segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury, and
distinguishes itself based on quality service. The Company has 48 branches in
Puerto Rico and a subsidiary in Boca Raton, Florida. The Company s long-term
goal is to strengthen its banking and financial services franchise by expanding
its lending businesses, increasing the level of integration in the marketing
and delivery of banking and financial services, maintaining effective
asset-liability management, growing non-interest revenue from banking and
financial services, and improving operating efficiencies.  

The
Company s diversified mix of businesses and products generates both the
interest income traditionally associated with a banking institution and
non-interest income traditionally associated with a financial services
institution (generated by such businesses as securities brokerage, fiduciary
services, investment banking, insurance agency, and retirement plan
administration). Although all of these businesses, to varying degrees, are
affected by interest rate and financial market fluctuations and other external
factors, the Company s commitment is to continue producing a balanced and
growing revenue stream.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES     

  The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make a number of
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements.
Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management
judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding
our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting
policies in  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of our 2015
Form 10-K.  

  In
the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section of our 2015 Form
10-K, we identified the following accounting policies as critical because they
require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and
inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and
assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations
or financial condition:  

Loans and lease receivables  

Allowance for loan and lease losses  

Financial instruments  

We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and
judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing
conditions. Management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting
policies and has discussed its judgments and assumptions with the Audit
Committee of our Board of Directors. E   ffective
June 30, 2016, pursuant to supervisory direction, the Company changed the
purchase credit impaired policy for all loans accounted for under ASC 310-30.
Under the revised policy, the Company writes-off the loan s recorded investment
and derecognizes the associated allowance for loan and lease losses for loans
that exit the pools. The revised policy implementation was performed
prospectively due to the immaterial impact for retrospective adoption. Prior to
June 30, 2016, the pool s carrying value and allowance was determined by
discount expected cash flows at the pool s effective yield. The allowance for
loan and lease losses was maintained until all of the loans in the pool were
paid off or charged-off.  The transition to this revised policy on June 30,
2016 resulted in the de-recognition of loans recorded investment balance and
associated allowance for loans that had exited the pools, with no impact to
provision for loan and lease losses. Other than this change,    t  here have been no material changes in the methods used to
formulate these critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our 2015
Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE    

86       

87       

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016    

              Net income
available to shareholders totaled    $11.7 million, or $0.26 per share fully
diluted, compared to $1.1 million, or $0.03 per share fully diluted in the year
ago quarter.  

              Oriental Bank s
overall business performance continued strong.    New loan
generation totaled $226.8 million. Banking and wealth management fee revenues decreased
slightly versus the year ago quarter. Retail and commercial deposits totaled
$4.8 billion. Net new customer accounts continued to increase at a 4%
annualized rate.  

              Major credit
exposure eliminated.    As
previously announced, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its $200.0
million participation in PREPA fuel line of credit, with the transaction
settling after quarter end. The sale eliminated $183.0 million of
non-performing assets. At September 30, 2016, this line of credit was reported
as other loans held for sale, at its fair value of $123.1 million. As a result
of the sale, the Company recognized a $56.2 million charge-off and a $2.9
million provision for loan and lease losses during the quarter ended September
30, 2016.   

              Credit quality improved,
mainly from aforementioned PREPA selling agreement.    Non-performing
loan rates at 3.68% decreased significantly compared with 9.09% at September
30, 2015. Separately, early and total delinquencies of non-acquired loans were
below year-ago levels.  

              Capital
continued to build.    Tangible
book value per common share increased to $15.18 from $14.53 at December 31,
2015. Tangible common equity ratio increased to 10.25% from 9.10%.  

              Net Interest
Margin (NIM) decreased    to 4.95% compared to 5.29% in the year ago quarter,
but increased 26 basis points from previous quarter.  

              Costs remained
under control.   
The operating efficiency ratio improved to 57.69%, the best level in the last
five quarters, as a result of continued focus on optimizing the expense base.

ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The following tables show major categories of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, their respective interest income, expenses,
yields and costs, and their impact on net interest income due to changes in
volume and rates for the quarters and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015:

Net Interest Income    

Net
interest income is a function of the difference between rates earned on the Company s
interest-earning assets and rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities
(interest rate spread) and the relative amounts of its interest earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities (interest rate margin). The Company constantly
monitors the composition and re-pricing of its assets and liabilities to
maintain its net interest income at adequate levels.    

Comparison
of quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Table 1 above shows the major categories
of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, their respective
interest income, expenses, yields and costs, and their impact on net interest
income due to changes in volume and rates for the quarters ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.   

Net interest
income of $76.9 million decreased 14.4% compared with $89.8 million reported in
the third quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease of 15.1% in interest
income from loans.   

Interest rate
spread decreased 34 basis points from 5.21% to 4.87%. This decrease is mainly
due to the net effect of a 48 basis points decrease in the average yield of
interest-earning assets from 6.31% to 5.83% and a 14 basis point decrease in
the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 1.10% to 0.96%.   

Interest income
decreased to $90.6 million from $107.2 million. Such decrease reflects
decreases of $12.5 million and $4.2 million in the volume and interest rate,
respectively, of interest-earning assets. Interest income from investments
decreased 20.1% to $8.0 million, reflecting decreases in volume and interest
rate of $1.5 million and $492 thousand, respectively. Interest income from
loans decreased 15.1% to $82.6 million, reflecting a decrease in volume and
interest rate of $11.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, primarily due to
lower acquired loan balances and yields. Our loan portfolio is transitioning as
originated loans with normal yields grow at a slower pace than higher-yielding
acquired loans decrease due to repayments and maturities.    

Originated loans
interest income increased 9.8% to $50.6 million as average balances grew 6.8%
and yields increased 18 basis points to 6.35%. Acquired BBVAPR loans interest
income declined 35.5% to $22.7 million as average balances declined 26.6% and
yields decreased 113 basis points to 8.19%. Acquired Eurobank loans interest
income fell 41.8% to $9.3 million as average balances declined 29.4% and yields
decreased 577 basis points to 26.85%.    

The average
balance of total interest-earning assets was $6.169 billion, a decrease of 8.5%
from the same period in 2015. The decrease in average balance of
interest-earning assets was mainly attributable to a decrease of 5.5% in
average loans, and a decrease of 15.1% in average investments. The decrease in
average loans is mostly related to the bulk sale on September 28, 2015, of a
portion of covered non-performing commercial loans amounting to $  197.1   million unpaid principal
balance ($  100.0   million carrying amount),
the strategic decrease of government exposures, and the repayment and
maturities of acquired loans.    

Interest expense
decreased 21.6% to $13.7 million, primarily because of a $4.4 million decrease
in the volume of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase
of $680 thousand in interest rate. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities
is mostly due to the decrease in repurchase agreements and other borrowings volume
of $3.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. During the first quarter of
2016, the Company made a partial unwinding of a repurchase agreement amounting
to $268.0 million, which carried a cost of 4.78%. In addition, during the third
quarter of 2016, $227.0 million in short term FHLB advances were repaid at
maturity. The cost of deposits increased 6 basis points to 0.62% for the third
quarter of 2016, compared to 0.56% for the third quarter of 2015. The cost of
borrowings increased 2 basis points to 2.74% from 2.72%.    

93       

Comparison
of nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Table 1A above
shows the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, their respective interest income, expenses, yields and costs, and
their impact on net interest income due to changes in volume and rates for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Net interest income of
$225.2 million decreased 14.0% compared with $261.8 million reported during    the same period in 2015   ,
reflecting a decrease of 14.7% in interest income from loans.   

Interest rate
spread decreased 43 basis points from 5.11% to 4.68%. This decrease is mainly
due to the net effect of a 51 basis point decrease in the average yield of
interest-earning assets from 6.22% to 5.71% and an 8 basis point decrease in
average costs of interest-bearing liabilities from 1.11% to 1.03%.   

Interest income
decreased to $269.8 million from $313.7 million in the same period in 2015.
Such decrease reflects decreases of $31.4 million and $12.5 million in the
volume and interest rate, respectively, of interest-earning assets. Interest
income from loans decreased 14.7% to $243.4 million, reflecting a decrease in
volume and interest rate of $29.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively,
primarily due to lower acquired loan balances and yields. Our loan portfolio is
transitioning as originated loans with normal yields grow at a slower pace than
higher-yielding acquired loans decrease due to repayments and maturities.    

Originated loans
interest income increased 8.1% to $147.6 million as average balances grew 7.7%
and yields remained at 6.28%. Acquired BBVAPR loans interest income declined
31.0% to $72.0 million as average balances declined 27.4% and yields decreased
45 basis points to 8.20%. Acquired Eurobank loans interest income fell 46.2% to
$23.8 million as average balances declined 40.0% and yields decreased 269 basis
points to 22.5%. Interest income from investments decreased 7.2% to $26.4
million, reflecting a decrease in volume of $1.9 million and $104 thousand
decrease in interest rate.         

The average
balance of total interest-earning assets was $6.291 billion, a decrease of 6.7%
from the same period in 2015. The decrease in average balance of
interest-earning assets was mainly attributable to a decrease of 6.6% in
average loans. The decrease in average loans is mostly related to the bulk sale
on September 28, 2015, of a portion of covered non-performing commercial loans
amounting to $197.1 million unpaid principal balance ($100.0 million carrying
amount), the strategic decrease of government exposures, and the repayment and
maturities of acquired loans.   

Interest expense
decreased 14.1% to $44.6 million, primarily because of a $9.0 million decrease
in the volume of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase
of $1.7 million in interest rate. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities is
mostly due to the decrease in repurchase agreements and other borrowings volume
of $7.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which was partially offset by
an increase in deposit interest rate of $1.8 million. During the first quarter
of 2016, the Company made a partial unwinding of a repurchase agreement amounting
to $268.0 million, which carried a cost of 4.78%. In addition, during the third
quarter of 2016, $227.0 million in short term FHLB advances were repaid at
maturity. The cost of deposits slightly increased 5 basis point to 0.62%,
compared to 0.57% for the same period in 2015. The cost of borrowings decreased
2 basis points to 2.84% from 2.86%.    

94       

Non-Interest Income, net    

Non-interest income is
affected by the level of trust assets under management, transactions generated
by clients  financial assets serviced by the securities broker-dealer and
insurance agency subsidiaries, the level of mortgage banking activities, and
the fees generated from loans and deposit accounts. It is also affected by the
FDIC shared-loss expense, which varies depending on the results of the on-going
evaluation of expected cash flows of the loan portfolio acquired in the FDIC-assisted
acquisition. In addition, it is affected by the amount of securities,
derivatives, trading and other transactions.   

     Comparison of quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

As shown in Table 2
above, the Company recorded non-interest income, net, in the amount of $20.2
million, compared to $36.0 million for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $15.8
million.    

   During the third quarter
of 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with the FDIC pursuant to which
the FDIC concurred with a sale of loss share assets covered under the
non-single family loss share agreement. As a result to such agreement, the FDIC
agreed to pay up to $20.0 million in loss share coverage with respect to the
aggregate loss resulting from the bulk sale of covered non-performing
commercial loans, as reflected in table 2, and such receivable was registered
as a reimbursement from the FDIC in light of the successful execution of the
bulk sale in 2015.  The net FDIC shared-loss expense increased to $3.3 million
as compared to $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2015. The increase is related
to the ongoing evaluation of expected cash flows of the covered loan portfolio
and from changes in the fair value of the true-up payment obligation (also
known as a clawback liability).    

   Other non-interest income
increased $5.4 million, as the Company received $5.0 million during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 from a loss in 2009 related to a private label
collateralized mortgage obligation.   

   Banking service revenue,
which consists primarily of fees generated by deposit accounts, electronic
banking services, and customer services, decreased to $10.3 million, as
compared to $10.8 million the same period in 2015. The decrease is mainly
driven by lower prepayment loan fees, from the early cancellation of a credit
facility to a public corporation in the third quarter of 2015, and lower
automatic teller machine network service fees, partially offset by higher debit
card interchange income.   

95       

Wealth management revenue, which consists of commissions and fees
from fiduciary activities, and securities brokerage and insurance activities,
decreased 5.2% to $6.5 million, compared to $6.9 million for the same period in
2015. Such decrease reflects a reduction in some securities brokerage
activities and a reduction in fees from the IRA portfolio. Client trading
volumes in our broker-dealer subsidiary continued to fall due to general
investor uncertainty in the Puerto Rico market.   

   Income generated from
mortgage banking activities increased 43.3% to $1.4 million, compared to $992
thousand for the same period in 2015. Mortgage banking activities increased because
of a decrease in losses from repurchased loans and the recognition of mortgage service
fees partially offset by a decrease in servicing income.    

Comparison of nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

The Company recorded
non-interest income, net in the amount of $48.9 million, compared to $38.2
million for the same period in 2015, an increase of 27.9%, or $10.7 million.    

   During the third quarter
of 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with the FDIC pursuant to which
the FDIC concurred with a sale of loss share assets covered under the
non-single family loss share agreement. As a result to such agreement, the FDIC
agreed to pay up to $20.0 million in loss share coverage with respect to the
aggregate loss resulting from the bulk sale of covered non-performing
commercial loans, as reflected in table 2, and such receivable was registered
as a reimbursement from the FDIC in light of the successful execution of the
bulk sale. The net FDIC shared-loss expense decreased to $10.7 million as
compared to $38.4 million for the same period in 2015, primarily from the
expiration of the FDIC commercial and non-single family loans loss share coverage
at June 30, 2015.   

   D    uring the first quarter
of 2016, the Company capitalized on favorable market conditions to partially
unwind a high-rate repurchase agreement amounting to $268.0 million at a cost
of $12.0 million, included as a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the
unaudited statements of operations. In addition, the Company sold $277.2
million in mortgage backed securities and $11.1 million in Puerto Rico
government bonds. As a result, the Company recorded a net gain on sale of
securities of $12.2 million. During the nine-month period ended September 30,
2015, the Company recorded a net gain on sale of securities of $2.6 million.   

   Other non-interest income
increased $8.5 million,     as the Company received $5.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 from
a loss in 2009 related to a private label collateralized mortgage obligation. In
addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 the Company
recognized a $1.9 million loss in the valuation of a mortgage servicing asset
sold.    

   Wealth management
revenue, which consists of commissions and fees from fiduciary activities, and
securities brokerage and insurance activities, decreased 7.5% to $19.7 million,
compared to $21.3 million for the same period in 2015. Such decrease reflects a
reduction in some securities brokerage activities of $1.1 million and a reduction
in fees from the IRA portfolio of $461 thousand.   

   Income generated from
mortgage banking activities decreased 30.0% to $3.3 million, compared to $4.7
million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in mortgage banking
activities was mostly due to a decrease in servicing income of $1.5 million, as
the Company sold part of its mortgage servicing asset during the second quarter
of 2015. In addition, mortgage banking activities were affected by foregone
gains on sales, which decreased $1.7 million, as a result of the Company
retaining securitized GNMA pools, offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in
losses from repurchased loans.    

   Banking service revenue,
which consists primarily of fees generated by deposit accounts, electronic
banking services, and customer services, slightly decreased 1.8% to $30.7
million from $31.2 million for the same period in 2015. Such decrease reflects
a reduction in loan prepayment fees of $776 thousand from the early
cancellation of a credit facilities to a public corporation and a reduction in checking
overdraft fees of $278 thousand, partially offset by an increase of $390
thousand in electronic banking fees.   

96       

97       

Non-Interest Expenses    

Comparison of quarters ended September 30,
2016 and 2015     

   Non-interest expense for
the third quarter of 2016 was $54.9 million, representing a decrease of 20.5%
compared to $69.1 million in the same quarter of the previous year.   

   Foreclosure, repossession and other real
estate expenses decreased 68.2% to $5.3 million, as compared to $16.6 million
in the same period for the previous year, primarily as a result of the bulk
sale of non-performing assets in the third quarter of 2015. The third quarter
of 2015 included a $3.2 million increase in other real estate owned and other
mortgage properties markdowns, as part of 2015 de-risking efforts. In addition,
the third quarter of 2015 included a loss of $2.3 million on the sale of
repossessed assets, contrasting with 2016 which included a gain of $450 thousand,
mainly due to efficiencies in the selling process.   

   Compensation and employee
benefits decreased 8.7%, or $1.8 million, to $19.2 million, mostly due to the
decrease in average employees. In addition, during the quarter ended September
30, 2015, the Company offered a voluntary early retirement program for
qualified employees and accumulated an additional compensation expense of $917
thousand related to this program.   

   Occupancy and equipment
decreased 12.5%, or $1.1 million, to $7.5 million, reflecting a reduction of
$1.0 million in depreciation expense for leasehold improvements, rent expense,
security equipment rent and maintenance, and building maintenance, as a result
of the closing of seven branches during 2015.   

   Insurance expense
decreased 45.1%, or $1.0 million, to $1.2 million, as a result of a change in
the method for calculating the insurance premium for the FDIC Savings
Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The change became effective during the third
quarter of 2016.   

   Other operating expenses
increased 57.0%, or $1.1 million, to $3.1 million, which reflects an increase
in reserves for regulatory matters.   

   The efficiency
ratio improved to 57.69% from 63.66% for the same period in 2015. The
efficiency ratio measures how much of the Company s revenues is used to pay
operating expenses. The Company computes its efficiency ratio by dividing
non-interest expenses by the sum of its net interest income and non-interest
income, but excluding gains on the sale of investment securities, derivatives
gains or losses, FDIC shared-loss expense, losses on the early extinguishment
of debt, other gains and losses, and other income that may be considered
volatile in nature. Management believes that the exclusion of those items
permits consistent comparability. Amounts presented as part of non-interest
income that are excluded from the efficiency ratio computation for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $1.9 million and $17.3 million,
respectively.    

Comparison of nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015     

   Non-interest expense for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $163.6 million, representing
a decrease of 13.8% compared to $189.9 million in the same period of the
previous year.   

   Foreclosure, repossession and other real
estate expenses decreased 59.1% to $13.3 million, as compared to $32.4 million
in the same period for the previous year, primarily as a result of the bulk
sale of non-performing assets in the third quarter of 2015. The nine-month
period ended September 30, 2015 included a $12.7 million increase in other real
estate owned and other mortgage properties markdowns, as part of 2015
de-risking efforts. Also, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015
included a loss of $5.0 million on the sale of repossessed assets, contrasting
with 2016 which included a gain of $2.0 million, mainly due to efficiencies in
the selling process.   

   Occupancy and equipment
decreased 10.2% to $23.4 million reflecting a reduction of $2.9 million in
depreciation of leasehold improvements, rent expense, security equipment rent
and maintenance, and building maintenance, as a consequence of the closing of
seven branches during 2015.   

   Compensation and employee
benefits decreased 4.1%, or $2.4 million, to $58.0 million, mostly due to the
decrease in average employees. In addition, during the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2015, the Company offered a voluntary early retirement program
for qualified employees and accumulated an additional compensation expense of $917
thousand related to this program.   

98       

Professional and service fees decreased 11.7%, or $1.4 million, to
$10.9 million, mostly due to lower legal expenses from strategic initiatives to
reduce costs, lower collection services due to in-house collection efforts, and
lower consulting fees due to non-recurring expenses in 2015.   

   Electronic banking charges decreased 6.6%,
or $1.1 million to $15.6 million mostly due the a reduction of $1.6 million in
debit card merchant and billing fees, partially offset by $427 thousand in
debit and credit card processing service fees.   

   The decreases in the
foregoing non-interest expenses were partially offset by increases in insurance
expense and information technology.   

   Insurance expense increased
16.7% to $7.5 million, as compared to $6.5 million in the same period of 2015,
mainly due to an increase in the SAIF premium during the fourth quarter of
2015. This increase was partially offset by a change in the method for
calculating the insurance premium for the SAIF, which became effective during
the third quarter of 2016.   

   Information technology
expenses increased 17.5% to $5.1 million, as compared to $4.4 million in the
same period of 2015, mainly due to an increase in the data processing expenses.   

   The efficiency
ratio improved to 58.66% from 59.51% for the same period in 2015. The
efficiency ratio measures how much of the Company s revenues is used to pay
operating expenses. The Company computes its efficiency ratio by dividing
non-interest expenses by the sum of its net interest income and non-interest
income, but excluding gains on the sale of investment securities, derivatives
gains or losses, FDIC shared-loss expense, losses on the early extinguishment
of debt, other gains and losses, and other income that may be considered
volatile in nature. Management believes that the exclusion of those items
permits consistent comparability. Amounts presented as part of non-interest income
that are excluded from efficiency ratio computation for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $4.8 million and $19.1 million,
respectively.    

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses    

     Comparison of quarters ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Provision for loan and
lease losses decreased 54.5%, or $28.1 million, to $23.5 million. Based on an
analysis of the credit quality and the composition of the Company s loan
portfolio, management determined that the provision for the quarter was
adequate to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at an appropriate
level to provide for probable losses based upon an evaluation of known and
inherent risks.    

   Provision for originated
and other loan and lease losses increased 40.6%, or $4.2 million, to $14.7
million from $10.5 million when compared with the same period in 2015.
Commercial provision increased $4.3 million to $5.8 million, compared to $1.5
million for the same period in 2015. This increase included $2.9 million
towards the PREPA credit, which was held for sale, and another $2.9 million for
a single commercial loan. Mortgage provision increased to $1.6 million,
compared to $4 thousand for the same period in 2015. Consumer provision
increased $934 thousand to $3.6 million, from $2.6 million for the same period
in 2015. Increases were partially offset by a decrease in the auto and leasing
provision of $3.1 million to $3.8 million, from $6.9 million.    

   Total charge-offs on
originated and other loans increased 438.8% to $69.3 million, as compared to
$12.9 million for the same period in 2015. Commercial charge-offs increased
$55.9 million to $56.7 million, from $828 thousand as a result of a $56.2
million charge-off in connection with the sale of the PREPA credit. Consumer
charge-offs increased $702 thousand to $3.2 million. Mortgage charge-offs
increased to $1.7 million, from $1.1 million. Auto and leasing charge-offs
decreased $706 thousand to $7.8 million. Total recoveries on originated and
other loans increased from $3.8 million to $4.0 million. Net charge-off rate
increased 704 basis points to 8.27% due to the aforementioned sale of PREPA
credit.   

99       

Provision for acquired loan and lease losses decreased 78.7%, or
$32.4 million, to $8.8 million from $41.1 million when compared with the same
period in 2015. Provision for acquired BBVAPR loan and lease losses increased
$312 thousand to $7.9 million from $7.6 million, when compared to the same
period in 2015. Provision for acquired Eurobank loan and lease losses decreased
$32.7 million from $33.5 million to $819 thousand. Such decrease reflects an
additional provision of $32.9 million during the third quarter of 2015 recorded
as a result of the sale of  non-performing commercial acquired Eurobank loans
amounting to $197.1 million, unpaid principal balance ($100.0 million carrying
amount).   

     Comparison of nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Provision for loan and
lease losses decreased 52.7%, or $57.6 million, to $51.7 million. Based on an
analysis of the credit quality and the composition of the Company s loan
portfolio, management determined that the provision for the quarter was
adequate to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at an appropriate
level to provide for probable losses based upon an evaluation of known and
inherent risks.    

   Provision for originated
and other loan and lease losses decreased 36.6%, or $19.9 million, to $34.4
million from $54.3 million when compared with the same period in 2015. The
provision was high in the 2015 period because in the first quarter of 2015, the
Company changed to non-accrual status the PREPA line of credit and recorded a
$24.0 million provision for loan and lease losses related thereto. This
decrease was partially offset by a $2.9 million provision related to the sale
of the PREPA credit and another $2.9 million provision for a single commercial
loan recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.   

   Total charge-offs on
originated and other loans increased 159.6% to $95.8 million, as compared to
$36.9 million for the same period in 2015. Commercial charge-offs increased
$56.2 million to $58.5 million as a result of a $56.2 million charge-off in
connection with the sale of the PREPA credit. Consumer charge-offs increased
$1.9 million to $8.3 million. Mortgage charge-offs increased $864 thousand to
$4.7 million. Auto and leasing charge-offs decreased $42 thousand to $24.3
million. Total recoveries on originated and other loans decreased from $11.5
million to $10.9 million. Net charge-off rate increased 367 basis points to
5.42% due to the aforementioned sale of PREPA credit.   

   Provision for acquired
loan and lease losses decreased 68.6%, or $37.7 million, to $17.3 million from
$55.0 million when compared with the same period in 2015. Provision for
acquired BBVAPR loan and lease losses decreased $2.2 million to $14.6 million
from $16.8 million, which included a provision of $5.2 million related to the
sale of certain non-performing commercial loans during the third quarter of
2015. This decrease was partially offset by a $4.4 million provision during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 in connection with a loan to the Puerto Rico
Housing Finance Authority (PRHFA). Provisions for acquired Eurobank loan and
lease losses decreased $35.5 million from $38.2 million to $2.7 million. The
provision was higher in the 2015 period because of a provision of $32.9 million
related to the sale of certain non-performing commercial loans during the third
quarter of 2015.   

    Income Taxes    

Comparison of quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Income tax expense was $3.6 million,
compared to $562 thousand for the same period in 2015. Income tax expense
reflects the net income before income taxes of $18.7 million for the third
quarter of 2016, compared to a net income before taxes of $5.1 million for the
year-ago quarter.    

Comparison of nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Income tax expense was $15.1 million, compared to $2.3 million for
the same period in 2015. Income tax expense reflects the net income before
income taxes of $58.8 million for the nine-month period of 2016, compared to a

Business Segments     

   The Company segregates its businesses into the following
major reportable segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury. Management
established the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to
evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. Other factors
such as the Company s organization, nature of its products, distribution
channels and economic characteristics of the products were also considered in
the determination of the reportable segments. The Company measures the
performance of these reportable segments based on pre-established goals of
different financial parameters such as net income, net interest income, loan
production, and fees generated. The Company s methodology for allocating
non-interest expenses among segments is based on several factors such as
revenue, employee headcount, occupied space, dedicated services or time, among
others.  Following are the results of operations and the selected financial
information by operating segment for the quarters and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Comparison
of quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Banking 

Net interest income of the Company s Banking segment     de    creased $14.4 million for 2016, or 16.0%,     reflecting a decrease in interest
income from loans of $14.7 million, or 15.1%,     to $82.6 million. Such decrease is comprised of $11.0
million and $3.7 million in volume and interest rate, respectively, of loans,
primarily due to lower acquired loan balances and yields. Our loan portfolio is
transitioning as originated loans with normal yields grow at a slower pace than
higher-yielding acquired loans decrease due to repayments and maturities.    

Originated loans interest income increased 9.8% to $50.6 million
as average balances grew 6.8% and yields increased 18 basis points to 6.35%.
Acquired BBVAPR loans interest income declined 35.5% to $22.7 million as
average balances declined 26.6% and yields decreased 113 basis points to 8.19%.
Acquired Eurobank loans interest income fell 41.8% to $9.3 million as average
balances declined 29.4% and yields decreased 577 basis points to 26.85%.    

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased 54.4% to $23.5
million.    

Provision for originated and other loan and lease losses increased
40.6%, or $4.2 million, to $14.7 million from $10.5 million when compared with
the same period in 2015. Commercial loan provision increased $4.3 million to
$5.8 million, compared to $1.5 million provision for the same quarter in 2015.
This increase included $2.9 million related to the sale of the PREPA credit and
another $2.9 million for a single commercial loan. Mortgage loan provision
increased to $1.6 million, compared to $4 thousand for the same quarter in
2015. Consumer loan provision increases $934 thousand to $3.6 million, from
$2.6 million for the same quarter in 2015. Increases were partially offset by a
decrease in auto and leasing portfolio provision of $3.1 million to $3.8
million, from $6.9 million for the same quarter of 2015.         

Provision for acquired loan and lease losses decreased 78.7%, or
$32.4 million, to $8.8 million from $41.1 million when compared with the same
period in 2015. Provision for acquired BBVAPR loan and lease losses increased
$312 thousand to $7.9 million from $7.6 million, when compared to the same
period in 2015. Provision for acquired Eurobank loan and lease losses decreased
$32.7 million from $33.5 million to $819 thousand. Such decrease reflects an
additional provision of $32.9 million during the third quarter of 2015 recorded
as a result of the sale of  non-performing commercial acquired Eurobank loans
amounting to $197.1 million, unpaid principal balance ($100.0 million, carrying
amount).   

Non-interest income, net, is affected by the level of mortgage
banking activities and fees generated from loans and deposit accounts. It is
also affected by the FDIC shared-loss expense, which varies depending on the
on-going evaluation of expected cash flows of the loan portfolio acquired in
the FDIC-assisted acquisition. Non-interest income decreased $21.2 million to
$8.9 million from $30.1 million during the same quarter in 2015. During the
third quarter of 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with the FDIC
pursuant to which the FDIC concurred with a sale of loss share assets covered
under the non-single family loss share agreement. As a result to such
agreement, the FDIC agreed to pay up to $20.0 million in loss share coverage
with respect to the aggregate loss resulting from the bulk sale of covered
non-performing commercial loans, and such receivable was registered as a reimbursement
from the FDIC in light of the successful execution of the bulk sale. The net
FDIC shared-loss expense increased to $3.3 million as compared to $2.1 million
for the third quarter of 2015. The increase is related to the ongoing
evaluation of expected cash flows of the covered loan portfolio and from
changes in the fair value of the true-up payment obligation.   

Non-interest expense of $50.1 million decreased 20.6% when
compared to the third quarter of 2015. F    oreclosure, repossession and other real estate expenses decreased
$11.3 million to $5.3 million, as compared to $16.6 million in the same period
for the previous year, primarily as a result of the bulk sale of non-performing
assets in the third quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2015 included a $3.2
million increase in other real estate owned and other mortgage properties
markdowns, as part of 2015 de-risking efforts. In addition, the third quarter
of 2015 included a loss of $2.3 million on the sale of repossessed assets,
contrasting with 2016 which included a gain of $450 thousand, mainly due to
efficiencies in the selling process. Insurance expense decreased $1.0 million
to $1.2 million, as a result of a change in the method for calculating the
insurance premium for the SAIF, which became effective during the third quarter
of 2016.    

103       

Wealth
Management    

Wealth management net revenue, which consists of commissions and fees from
fiduciary activities, and securities brokerage and insurance activities, increased
$1.1 million to $2.4 million, compared to $1.2 million for the same quarter in
2015, mainly due to a decrease of $1.3 million in non-interest expenses, mainly
in compensation expense.   

Treasury    

Treasury net revenue, which consists of the Company's
asset/liability management activities, such as purchase and sale of investment
securities, interest rate risk management, derivatives, and borrowings,
increased to a gain of $4.9 million, compared to a loss of $2.0 million in the third
quarter of 2015. This increase is mostly due to an increase in non-interest
income from a loss of $634 thousand to a gain of $4.9 million, as the Company
received $5.0 million from a loss in 2009 from a private label collateralized
mortgage obligation.    

Net interest income     increased $1.5 million to $1.2 million. I    nterest income from investments reflects
decreases in     volume
and interest rate of $1.5 million and $492     thousand, respectively    . Interests expense declined $3.5 million to $6.9 million.     Decreases in both, interest income and
expenses were affected by a partial unwinding of a high-rate repurchase
agreement amounting to $268.0 million, which carried a cost of 4.78%, and the
sale of $272.1 million of mortgage backed securities and $11.1 million of Puerto
Rico government bonds during the first quarter of 2016. Also, during the third
quarter of 2016, $227.0 million in short term FHLB advances were repaid at
maturity.    

Comparison of nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015     

    Banking 

Net interest income of the Company s Banking segment     de    creased $41.1 million for 2016, or 15.6%,     reflecting a decrease in interest
income from loans of $41.8 million, or     14.7%    ,     to $243.4 million. Such decrease reflects
decreases of $29.5 million and a $12.4 million in volume and interest rate,
respectively, of loans, primarily due to lower acquired loan balances and
yields. Our loan portfolio is transitioning as originated loans with normal
yields grow at a slower pace than higher-yielding acquired loans fall due to
repayments and maturities.   

Originated loans interest income increased 8.1% to $147.6 million
as average balances grew 7.7% and yields remained at 6.28%. Acquired BBVAPR
loans interest income declined 31.0% to $72.0 million as average balances declined
27.4% and yields decreased 45 basis points to 8.20%. Acquired Eurobank loans
interest income fell 46.2% to $23.8 million as average balances declined 40.0%
and yields decreased 269 basis points to 22.5%. Interest income from
investments decreased 7.2% to $26.4 million, reflecting a decrease in volume of
$1.9 million and a decrease in interest rate of $104 thousand.   

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased 52.7%, or $57.6
million, to $51.7 million.   

Provision for originated and other loan and lease losses decreased 36.6%,
or $19.9 million, to $34.4 million from $54.3 million when compared with the
same period in 2015. The provision was high in the 2015 period because in the
first quarter of 2015, the Company changed to non-accrual status the PREPA line
of credit and recorded a $24.0 million provision for loan and lease losses
related thereto. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.9 million provision
related to the sale of the PREPA credit and another $2.9 million provision for
a single commercial loan recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.   

Provision for acquired loan and lease losses decreased 68.6%, or $37.7
million, to $17.3 million from $55.0 million when compared with the same period
in 2015. Provision for acquired BBVAPR loan and lease losses decreased $2.2
million to $14.6 million from $16.8 million, when compared to the same period
in 2015. An additional provision of $5.2 million was placed as a result of the
sale of certain non-performing commercial loans during the third quarter of
2015. This decrease was partially offset by a $4.4 million provision during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 for a loan to the PRHFA. Provision for
acquired Eurobank loan and lease losses decreased $35.5 million from $38.2
million to $2.7 million. Such decrease reflects an additional provision of
$32.9 million placed as a result of the sale of a certain non-performing
commercial acquired Eurobank loans during the third quarter of 2015.   

Non-interest income, net, is affected by the level of mortgage
banking activities and fees generated from loans and deposit accounts. It is
also affected by the FDIC shared-loss expense, which varies depending on the
results of the on-going evaluation of expected cash flows of the loan portfolio
acquired in the FDIC-assisted acquisition.    

104       

During the
third quarter of 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with the FDIC
pursuant to which the FDIC concurred with a sale of loss share assets covered
under the non-single family loss share agreement. As a result of such
agreement, the FDIC agreed to pay up to $20.0 million in loss share coverage
with respect to the aggregate loss resulting from the bulk sale of covered
non-performing commercial loans and such receivable was registered as a
reimbursement from the FDIC in light of the successful execution of the bulk
sale. The net FDIC shared-loss expense decreased to $10.7 million as compared
to $38.4 million for the same period in 2015, primarily from the expiration of
the FDIC commercial and non-single family loans loss share coverage at June 30,
2015.         

   Non-interest expense of $147.9
million decreased 12.6%, or $21.4 million, when compared to the same period in
2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in     foreclosure, repossession and other real estate expenses of $19.1
million to $13.3 million, as compared to $32.4 million in the same period for
the previous year, primarily as a result of the bulk sale of non-performing
assets in the third quarter of 2015. The nine-month period ended September 30,
2015 included a $12.7 million increase in other real estate owned and other
mortgage properties markdowns, as part of 2015 de-risking efforts. Also, the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 included a loss of $5.0 million on
the sale of repossessed assets, contrasting with 2016 which included a gain of
$2.0 million, mainly due to efficiencies in the selling process.         

Wealth Management    

Wealth management revenue, which consists of commissions and fees from fiduciary
activities, and securities brokerage and insurance activities, decreased 5.4%
to $19.3 million, compared to $20.4 million for the same period in 2015. Such
decrease reflects a reduction in some securities brokerage activities and a
reduction in fees from the IRA portfolio.   

Non-interest expenses decreased by 30.0% to $11.6 million, mainly due to
a payment of $2.1 million required by the broker-dealer's regulator during the
second quarter of 2015 and a reduction in compensation expense.   

Treasury    

Treasury net revenue, which consists of the Company's
asset/liability management activities, such as purchase and sale of investment
securities, interest rate risk management, derivatives, and borrowings,
increased to a gain of $3.1 million, compared to a loss of $4.4 million in the
same period in 2015. This increase is mostly due to an increase in non-interest
income from a loss of $4.0 million to a gain of $4.6 million, as the Company
received $5.0 million from a loss in 2009 related to a private label collateralized
mortgage obligation.   

Net interest income     increased $4.6 million to $2.6 million. I    nterest income from investments reflects
decreases in     volume
and interest rate of 2.0 million and $104     thousand, respectively    . Interests expense decline $6.6 million to $23.7 million.     Decreases in both, interest income and
expenses were affected by a partial unwinding of a high-rate repurchase
agreement amounting to $268.0 million, which carried a cost of 4.78%, and the
sale of $272.1 million of mortgage backed securities and $11.1 million of Puerto
Rico government bonds during the first quarter of 2016. Also, during the third
quarter of 2016, $227.0 million of short term FHLB advances were repaid at
maturity.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION     

Assets Owned    

At September 30,
2016, the Company s total assets amounted to $6.592 billion representing a
decrease of 7.1% when compared to $7.099 billion at December 31, 2015. This
reduction is mainly due to a decrease in the investment portfolio. The
investment portfolio decreased $318.2 million from $1.616 billion at December
31, 2015 to $1.298 billion, mainly from the sale of     $277.2 million in mortgage backed
securities and $11.1 million in Puerto Rico government bonds during the first
half of 2016. As a result, a    t
September 30, 2016, loans represented 77% of total interest-earning assets
while investments represented 23%, compared to 73% and 27%, respectively, at
December 31, 2015.   

The Company s loan
portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans, commercial loans
collateralized by mortgages on real estate located in Puerto Rico, other
commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans, and auto loans. At September
30, 2016, the Company s loan portfolio decreased by 3.1% to $4.299 billion
compared to $4.434 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower
acquired loan balances. Our loan portfolio is transitioning as originated loans
grow at a slower pace than acquired loans decrease, due to repayments and
maturities.  At September 30, 2016, the originated loan portfolio decreased
$48.9 million, mainly from the net transfer of PREPA to held-for-sale during
the third quarter of 2016. The acquired BBVAPR loan portfolio decreased $212.7
million, or 16.7%, and the acquired Eurobank loan portfolio decreased $10.3
million, or 7.0%, from December 31, 2015.    

    Financial
Assets Managed    

The Company s
financial assets include those managed by the Company s trust division,
retirement plan administration subsidiary, and assets gathered by its
broker-dealer subsidiary. The Company s trust division offers various types of individual
retirement accounts ( IRA s) and manages 401(k) and Keogh retirement
plans and custodian and corporate trust accounts, while the retirement plan
administration subsidiary, OPC, manages private retirement plans. At September
30, 2016, total assets managed by the Company s trust division and OPC amounted
to $2.867 billion, compared to $2.691 billion at December 31, 2015. Oriental
Financial Services offers a wide array of investment alternatives to its client
base, such as tax-advantaged fixed income securities, mutual funds, stocks,
bonds and money management wrap-fee programs. At September 30, 2016, total
assets gathered by Oriental Financial Services from its customer investment
accounts increased to $2.419 billion, compared to $2.375 billion at December
31, 2015. Changes in trust and broker-dealer related assets primarily reflect changes
in portfolio balances and differences in market values.   

106       

Goodwill    

Goodwill recorded in connection with the BBVAPR Acquisition and
the FDIC-assisted Eurobank acquisition is not amortized to expense, but is
tested at least annually for impairment. A quantitative annual impairment test
is not required if, based on a qualitative analysis, the Company determines
that the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely
than not that goodwill is not impaired. The Company completes its annual
goodwill impairment test as of October 31 of each year.  The Company tests for
impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities,
as necessary, to defined reporting units. A fair value is then determined for
each reporting unit. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their
book values, no write-down of the recorded goodwill is necessary. If the fair
values are less than the book values, an additional valuation procedure is
necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill.   

Reporting unit valuation is inherently subjective, with a number
of factors based on assumptions and management judgments or estimates. Actual
values may differ significantly from such estimates. Among these are future
growth rates for the reporting units, selection of comparable market
transactions, discount rates and earnings capitalization rates. Changes in
assumptions and results due to economic conditions, industry factors, and
reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different
assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in
impairment charges. If an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount, an interim impairment test is required.       

Relevant events and circumstances for evaluating whether it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount may include macroeconomic conditions (such as a further
deterioration of the Puerto Rico economy or the liquidity for Puerto Rico
securities or loans secured by assets in Puerto Rico), adverse changes in legal
factors or in the business climate, adverse actions by a regulator,
unanticipated competition, the loss of key employees, or similar events. The
Company s loan portfolio, which is the largest component of its
interest-earning assets, is concentrated in Puerto Rico and is directly
affected by adverse local economic and fiscal conditions. Such conditions have
generally affected the market demand for non-conforming loans secured by assets
in Puerto Rico and, therefore, affect the valuation of the Company s assets.     

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $86.1 million of
goodwill allocated as follows: $84.1 million to the Banking unit and $2.0
million to the Wealth Management unit. During the last quarter of 2015, based
on its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company determined that the Banking
unit failed step one of the two-step impairment test and that the Wealth Management
unit passed such step. As a result of step one, the Banking unit s adjusted net
book value exceeded its fair value by approximately $263.1 million, or 29.6%.
Accordingly, the Company proceeded to perform step two of the analysis. Based
on the results of step two, the Company determined that the carrying value of
the goodwill allocated to the Banking unit was not impaired as of the valuation
date. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company
performed an assessment of events or circumstances that could trigger
reductions in the book value of the goodwill. Based on this assessment, no
events were identified that triggered changes in the book value of goodwill at
September 30, 2016.   

107       

108       

109       

The Company s
loan portfolio is composed of two segments, loans initially accounted for under
the amortized cost method (referred as  originated and other  loans)
and loans acquired (referred as  acquired  loans). Acquired loans are
further segregated between acquired BBVAPR loans and acquired Eurobank loans.
Acquired Eurobank loans were purchased subject to loss-sharing agreements with
the FDIC.   The FDIC loss-sharing coverage, related to
acquired Eurobank commercial loans expired    on June 30, 2015   .    The
coverage for the single-family residential loans will expire on June 30, 2020   . At September 30, 2016, the
remaining covered loans amounting to $62.8 million, net carrying amount, are
included as part of acquired Eurobank loans under the name  loans secured
by 1-4 family residential properties.  At December 31, 2015, covered loans
amounted to $69.7 million, net carrying amount, and also included under the name
 loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties.    Covered loans are no longer a material
amount. Therefore, the Company changed its loan disclosures during 2015.  

As shown in Table 5 above, total loans, net, amounted
to $4.299 billion at September 30, 2016 and $4.434 billion at December 31,
2015. The Company s originated and other loans held-for-investment portfolio
composition and trends were as follows:  

Mortgage loan portfolio amounted to $735.4 million (24.4% of the
gross originated loan portfolio) compared to $757.8 million (24.4% of the gross
originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2015. Mortgage loan production
totaled $51.0 million and $157.0 million for the quarter and nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016, which represents a decrease of 21.8% and 18.2%, from
$65.2 million and $191.8 million, respectively. Mortgage loans included
delinquent loans in the GNMA buy-back option program amounting to $9.6 million
and $7.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Servicers of loans underlying GNMA mortgage-backed securities must report as
their own assets the defaulted loans that they have the option (but not the
obligation) to repurchase, even when they elect not to exercise that option.  

Commercial loan portfolio amounted to $1.267 billion (42.1% of
the gross originated loan portfolio) compared to $1.442 billion (46.3% of the
gross originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2015. Commercial loan
production decreased 24.8% and 28.1% to $62.6 million and $208.2 million for
the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, from $83.2 million
and $289.4 million for the same periods in 2015.  

Consumer loan portfolio amounted to $278.7 million (9.3% of the
gross originated loan portfolio) compared to $243.0 million (7.8% of the gross
originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2015. Consumer loan production
increased 18.7% and increased 14.3% to $43.6 million and $117.5 million for the
quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from
$36.8 million and $102.8 million for the same periods in 2015.  

Auto and leasing portfolio amounted to $730.6 million (24.2% of
the gross originated loan portfolio) compared to $669.2 million (21.5% of the
gross originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2015. Auto and leasing
production increased by 5.7% and 7.2% to $69.5 million and $207.2 million for
the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to $65.7 million and $193.2 million for the same periods in 2015.   

110       

111       

Some highlights follow regarding the data included above:   

Loans to municipalities are backed by their unlimited taxing
power for real and personal property taxes.   

Deposits
from municipalities, central government and other government entities totaled $165.0
million at September 30, 2016.   

The
outstanding balance of credit facilities to central government and public
corporations decreased by $200.8 million during 2016 mainly as a result of the
sale of the PREPA fuel line of credit which had an outstanding balance of
$190.3 million at December 31, 2015.    At
September 30, 2016, this fuel line of credit was reported as other loans held
for sale, at fair value. The sale transaction settled on October 7, 2016.  

112       

Credit Risk Management   

Allowance for Loan and Lease
Losses     

The Company maintains an allowance for
loan and lease losses at a level that management considers adequate to provide
for probable losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks. The
Company s allowance for loan and lease losses policy provides for a detailed
quarterly analysis of probable losses. At September 30, 2016, the Company s
allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to $119.0 million, a $115.1
million decrease from $234.1 million at December 31, 2015, mainly related to
the de-recognition of $82.0 million for a portion of the allowance for credit
impaired loans due to a revision in policy during the second quarter of 2016
and a $56.2 million charge-off during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 in
connection with the sale of PREPA participation.  

Effective June 30, 2016,
pursuant to supervisory direction, the Company revised the purchase credit
impaired policy for all loans accounted for under ASC 310-30. Under the revised
policy, the Company writes-off the loan s recorded investment and derecognizes
the associated allowance for loan and lease losses for loans that exit the
pools. The revised policy implementation was performed prospectively due to the
immaterial impact for retrospective adoption. Prior to June 30, 2016, the pool s
carrying value and allowance was determined by discount expected cash flows at
the pool s effective yield. The allowance for loan and lease losses was
maintained until all of the loans in the pool were paid off or charged-off. 
The transition to this revised policy on June 30, 2016 resulted in the
de-recognition of loans recorded investment balance and associated allowance
for loans and lease losses that had exited the pools with no impact to
provision for loan and lease losses.  

Tables 8 through 12 set forth an
analysis of activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses and present
selected loan loss statistics. In addition, Table 5 sets forth the composition
of the loan portfolio.   

At September 30, 2016, $62.2 million of
the allowance corresponded to originated and other loans held for investment,
or 2.06% of total originated and other loans held for investment, compared to
$112.6 million, or 3.62% of total originated and other loans held for
investment, at December 31, 2015. The allowance decreased mainly as a result of
the recognition of a $56.2 million charge-off in connection with the sale of
the PREPA participation during the third quarter of 2016. Provision for loan
and lease losses of $34.4 million and recoveries of $10.9 million, were offset
by charge-offs of $95.8 million during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016. The allowance for residential mortgage loans increased by 1.0% (or
$175 thousand), when compared with the balances recorded at December 31, 2015.
The allowance for consumer loans and auto and leases increased by 9.8% (or $1.1
million) and 4.1% (or $741 thousand), respectively, when compared with the
balances recorded at December 31, 2015. The allowance for commercial loans
decreased 81.0% (or $52.5 million), when compared with the balances recorded at
December 31, 2015, mainly from the sale of the PREPA participation.   

Allowance for loan and lease
losses recorded for acquired BBVAPR loans accounted for under the provisions of
ASC 310-20 at September 30, 2016 was $4.2 million compared to $5.5 million at
December 31, 2015, a 24.0% decrease.   The allowance decreased as a result of $4.5 million in charge-offs,
which were partially offset by a $1.4 million provision for loan and lease
losses and $1.8 million of recoveries during the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2016. The allowance for commercial loans decreased by 30.8% (or
$8 thousand), when compared with the balance recorded at December 31, 2015. The
allowance for consumer loans decreased by 14.1% (or $483 thousand) and auto
loans decreased by 40.2% (or $838 thousand), respectively, when compared with
the balances recorded at December 31, 2015, due to the normal amortization of
credit discount of these acquired loans.  

Allowance for loan and lease
losses recorded for acquired BBVAPR loans accounted for under ASC-310-30 at   September 30, 2016   was $29.8 million as compared to $25.8 million at
December 31, 2015.   The allowance
decreased mainly as a result of $8.9 million in allowance de-recognition from
revised purchased credit impaired loan policy and by loan pools fully
charged-off of $282 thousand, partially offset by a $13.2 million provision for
loan and lease losses during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.  

Allowance
for loan and lease losses recorded for acquired Eurobank loans at   September 30, 2016   was $22.8 million as compared to $90.2 million at
December 31, 2015.   The
allowance decreased as a result of $73.1 million in allowance de-recognition
from revised purchased credit impaired loan policy and by $134 thousand in loan
pools fully charged-off, partially offset by a $2.7 million provision for loan
and lease losses and by $3.2 million for the FDIC shared-loss portion of
provision for covered loan and lease losses.   The allowance for loan and lease losses on acquired Eurobank loans is
accounted for under the provisions of ASC 310-30. The portion of the loss on
covered loans reimbursable from the FDIC is recorded as an offset to the
provision for credit losses and increases the FDIC indemnification asset.

more detailed analysis of provisions for loan and lease losses.  

Non-performing Assets     

The Company s
non-performing assets include non-performing loans and foreclosed real estate
(see Tables 11 and 12). At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company had $107.6 million and $300.1 million, respectively, of non-accrual
loans, including acquired BBVAPR loans accounted for under ASC 310-20 (loans
with revolving feature and/or acquired at a premium). The decline of $193.0
million is directly related to the sale of PREPA participation,    which had an outstanding
balance of $190.3 million at December 31, 2015.    At September 30, 2016, this fuel line of credit was reported as other
loans held for sale, at fair value.   The sale transaction settled on October 7, 2016  .    

At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, loans whose terms have been extended and which are
classified as troubled-debt restructuring that are not included in
non-performing assets amounted to $100.3 million and $93.6 million,
respectively.   

Delinquent
residential mortgage loans insured or guaranteed under applicable FHA and VA
programs are classified as non-performing loans when they become 90 days or
more past due, but are not placed in non-accrual status until they become 18
months or more past due, since they are insured loans. Therefore, these loans are
included as non-performing loans but excluded from non-accrual loans.  

  Acquired loans with credit deterioration
are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method
under ASC 310-30, in which these loans will accrete interest income over the
remaining life of the loans using estimated cash flow analyses. Credit related
decreases in expected cash flows, compared to those previously forecasted are
recognized by recording a provision for credit losses on these loans when it is
probable that all cash flows expected at acquisition will not be collected.  

At September 30, 2016, the Company s
non-performing assets decreased by 56.4% to $160.3 million (2.92% of total
assets, excluding acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality) from $367.8
million (6.31% of total assets, excluding acquired loans with deteriorated
credit quality) at December 31, 2015. The Company does not expect
non-performing loans to result in significantly higher losses. At September 30,
2016, the allowance for originated loan and lease losses to non-performing
loans coverage ratio was 56.06% (37.15% at December 31, 2015).   

The Company follows a conservative
residential mortgage lending policy, with more than 90% of its residential
mortgage portfolio consisting of fixed-rate, fully amortizing, fully documented
loans that do not have the level of risk associated with subprime loans offered
by certain major U.S. mortgage loan originators. Furthermore, the Company has
never been active in negative amortization loans or adjustable rate mortgage
loans, including those with teaser rates.  

114       

The following
items comprise non-performing assets:  

Originated and other loans held
for investment:  

Mortgage loans   
  are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due
and are written-down, if necessary, based on the specific evaluation of the
collateral underlying the loan, except for FHA and VA insured mortgage loans
which are placed in non-accrual when they become 18 months or more past due. At
September 30, 2016, the Company s originated non-performing mortgage loans
totaled $75.6 million (67.0% of the Company s non-performing loans), a 2.9%
decrease from $77.9 million (25.5% of the Company s non-performing loans) at
December 31, 2015. Non-performing loans in this category are residential
mortgage loans.   

Commercial
loans      are placed on non-accrual
status when they become 90 days or more past due and are written-down, if
necessary, based on the specific evaluation of the underlying collateral, if
any. At September 30, 2016, the Company s originated non-performing commercial
loans amounted to $23.3 million (20.7% of the Company s non-performing loans),
a 89.2% decrease from $215.3 million at December 31, 2015 (70.5% of the
Company s non-performing loans), mainly from the sale of PREPA participation.
Most of this portfolio is collateralized by commercial real estate properties.   

Consumer loans   
  are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due and
written-off when payments are delinquent 120 days in personal loans and 180
days in credit cards and personal lines of credit. At September 30, 2016, the Company s originated
non-performing consumer loans totaled $2.5 million (2.2% of the Company s
non-performing loans), a 51.4% increase
from $1.6 million (0.5% of the Company s
non-performing loans) at December 31, 2015.  

Auto loans and leases      are placed on non-accrual status when they become
90 days past due, partially written-off to collateral value when payments are
delinquent 120 days, and fully written-off when payments are delinquent 180
days. At September 30, 2016, the Company s originated non-performing auto loans
and leases amounted to $9.5 million (8.4% of the Company s total non-performing
loans), an increase of 12.6% from $8.4 million at December 31, 2015 (2.8% of
the Company s total non-performing loans).  

Acquired BBVAPR loans accounted
for under ASC 310-20 (loans with revolving features and/or acquired at
premium):  

Commercial revolving lines of credit and credit cards      are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90
days or more past due and are written-down, if necessary, based on the specific
evaluation of the underlying collateral, if any. At September 30, 2016, the
Company s acquired non-performing commercial lines of credit accounted for
under ASC 310-20 amounted to $458 thousand (0.4% of the Company s
non-performing loans), a 48.0% decrease from $880 thousand at December 31, 2015
(0.3% of the Company s non-performing loans).  

Consumer revolving lines of credit and credit cards      are placed on non-accrual status when they become
90 days past due and written-off when payments are delinquent 180 days. At
September 30, 2016, the Company s acquired non-performing consumer lines of
credit and credit cards accounted for under ASC 310-20 totaled $703 thousand
(0.6% of the Company s non-performing loans), a 31.4% increase from $535
thousand at December 31, 2015 (0.2% of the Company s non-performing loans).  

Auto loans acquired at premium    - are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90
days past due, partially written-off to collateral value when payments are
delinquent 120 days, and fully written-off when payments are delinquent 180
days. At September 30, 2016, the Company s acquired non-performing auto loans
accounted for under ASC 310-20 totaled $777 thousand (0.7% of the Company s
non-performing loans), a 6.5% decrease from $831 thousand at December 31, 2015
(0.2% of the Company s non-performing loans).  

115       

The Company
has two mortgage loan modification programs. These are the Loss Mitigation
Program and the Non-traditional Mortgage Loan Program. Both programs are
intended to help responsible homeowners to remain in their homes and avoid
foreclosure, while also reducing the Company s losses on non-performing
mortgage loans.  

The Loss Mitigation Program helps
mortgage borrowers who are or will become financially unable to meet the
current or scheduled mortgage payments. Loans that qualify under this program
are those guaranteed by FHA, VA, PRHFA, ( Puerto Rico Housing Finance
Authority ), conventional loans guaranteed by Mortgage Guaranty Insurance
Corporation (MGIC), conventional loans sold to FNMA and FHLMC, and conventional
loans retained by the Company. The program offers diversified alternatives such
as regular or reduced payment plans, payment moratorium, mortgage loan
modification, partial claims (only FHA), short sale, and payment in lieu of
foreclosure.  

The Non-traditional Mortgage Loan
Program is for non-traditional mortgages, including balloon payment, interest
only/interests first, variable interest rate, adjustable interest rate and
other qualified loans. Non-traditional mortgage loan portfolios are segregated
into the following categories: performing loans that meet secondary market
requirement and are refinanced under the credit underwriting guidelines of
FHA/VA/FNMA/ FHLMC, and performing loans not meeting secondary market
guidelines processed by the Company s current credit and underwriting
guidelines. The Company achieved an affordable and sustainable monthly payment
by taking specific, sequential, and necessary steps such as reducing the
interest rate, extending the loan term, capitalizing arrearages, deferring the
payment of principal or, if the borrower qualifies, refinancing the loan.  

In order to
apply for any of the loan modification programs, if the borrower is active in
Chapter 13 bankruptcy, they must request an authorization from the bankruptcy
trustee to allow for the loan modification.  Borrowers with discharged
Chapter 7 bankruptcies may also apply. Loans in these programs are evaluated by
designated underwriters for troubled-debt restructuring classification if the
Company grants a concession for legal or economic reasons due to the debtor s
financial difficulties.

FDIC Indemnification Asset    

The Company recorded the FDIC
indemnification asset, measured separately from the covered loans, as part of
the Eurobank FDIC-assisted transaction. Based on the accounting guidance in ASC
Topic 805, at each reporting date subsequent to the initial recording of the
indemnification asset, the Company measures the indemnification asset on the
same basis as the covered loans and assesses its collectability. The amount to
be ultimately collected for the indemnification asset is dependent upon the
performance of the underlying covered assets, the passage of time, claims
submitted to the FDIC and the Corporation s compliance with the terms of the
loss sharing agreements. Refer to Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated
financial statements for additional information on the FDIC loss share
agreements.         

The FDIC loss share coverage for the commercial loans and other
non-single family loans was in effect until June 30, 2015. The coverage for the
single family residential loans will expire on June 30, 2020. Accordingly,
the Company amortized the remaining portion of the FDIC indemnification asset
attributable to non-single family loans at the close of the second quarter of
2015. At September 30, 2016, the FDIC indemnification asset only reflects the
balance for single family residential mortgage loans.

Liabilities and Funding Sources    

As shown in
Table 15 above, at September 30, 2016, the Company s total liabilities were $5.667
billion, 8.6% less than the $6.202 billion reported at December 31, 2015.
Deposits and borrowings, the Company s funding sources, amounted to $5.555
billion at September 30, 2016 versus $6.089 billion at December 31, 2015, an
8.8% decrease.   

At September 30, 2016, deposits
represented 86% and borrowings represented 14% of interest-bearing liabilities.
At September 30, 2016, deposits, the largest category of the Company s
interest-bearing liabilities, were $4.755 billion, an increase of 0.8% from
$4.718 billion at December 31, 2015. Demand and savings deposits increased 5.4%
to $3.131 billion, time deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased 8.1%
to $1.043 billion, and brokered deposits decreased 25.8% to $581.2 million, as
part of our efforts to reduce the cost of deposits, which averaged 0.62% at
September 30, 2016 compared to 0.59% at December 31, 2015.   

Borrowings
consist mainly of repurchase agreements, FHLB-NY advances and subordinated
capital notes. At September 30, 2016, borrowings amounted to $800.3 million,
representing a decrease of 41.6% when compared with the $1.372 billion reported
at December 31, 2015. The decrease in borrowings is attributed to decreases in
repurchases agreements, FHLB-NY advances and  subordinated capital notes. Repurchase
agreements at September 30, 2016 decreased $276.5 million to $658.2 million
from $934.7 million at December 31, 2015, as the Company partially unwound
$268.0 million in repurchase agreements at a cost of $12.0 million during the
first quarter of 2016.  As a member of the FHLB-NY, the Bank can obtain
advances from the FHLB-NY secured by the FHLB-NY stock owned by the Bank as
well as by certain of the Bank s mortgage loans and investment securities.
FHLB-NY advances decreased $226.5 million to $105.9 million at September 30,
2016 as $227.0 million of advances were repaid at maturity during 2016 and not
renewed. Also, $67.0 million in subordinated capital notes were repaid at maturity
during the third quarter of 2016.     

Stockholders 
Equity    

At September 30, 2016, the Company s total
stockholders  equity was $924.9 million, a 3.1% increase when compared to
$897.1 million at December 31, 2015. This increase in stockholders  equity
reflects increases in retained earnings of $21.0 million, in legal surplus of
$4.4 million, and in accumulated comprehensive income of $1.8 million, which in
turn reflects the realized gains on available-for-sale securities for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. Book value per share was $17.29 at September
30, 2016 compared to $16.67 at December 31, 2015.   

From December
31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, tangible common equity to total assets
increased to 10.11% from 8.98%, Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio increased to 12.35%
from 11.18%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 13.32% from
$12.14%, Tier 1 Risk-Based capital ratio increased to 17.44% from 15.99%, and
Total Risk-Based capital ratio increased to 18.71% from 17.29%.    

New
Capital Rules to Implement Basel III Capital Requirements   

In
July 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Board ),
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC ) and the FDIC
(together with the Board and the OCC, the  Agencies ) approved new rules ( New
Capital Rules ) to establish a revised comprehensive regulatory capital
framework for all U.S. banking organizations. The New Capital Rules generally
implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s (the  Basel Committee )
December 2010 final capital framework referred to as  Basel III  for
strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules
substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank
holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the
Company and the Bank, as compared to the previous U.S. general risk-based
capital rules. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components
of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator
in banking institutions  regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also
address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in
banking institutions  regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing
general risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee s
1988  Basel I  capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in
part, on the  standardized approach  in the Basel Committee s 2004  Basel II 
capital accords. In addition, the New Capital Rules implement certain
provisions of Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to
remove references to credit ratings from the federal agencies  rules. The New
Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015,
subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components and other
provisions. Among other matters, the New Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new
capital measure called  Common Equity Tier 1  ( CET1 ) and related regulatory
capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital
consists of CET1 and  Additional Tier 1 capital  instruments meeting certain
revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to
regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of
capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and      

125       

adjustments to capital as compared to existing
regulations. Under the New Capital Rules, for most banking organizations,
including the Company, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2
capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and
lease losses, in each case, subject to the New Capital Rules  specific
requirements.  

Pursuant to the
New Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as
follows:  

4.5%
CET1 to risk-weighted assets;  

6.0%
Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1    plus    Additional Tier 1 capital) to
risk-weighted assets;  

8.0%
Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital    plus    Tier 2 capital) to
risk-weighted assets; and  

4%
Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated
financial statements (known as the  leverage ratio ).  

  The New Capital Rules also introduce a
new 2.5%  capital conservation buffer , composed entirely of CET1, on top of
the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer
is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking
institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but
below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends,
equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus,
when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Company and the Bank will be
required to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1,
effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of
at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and
(iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.  

The New Capital Rules provide for a
number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example,
the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising
from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating
loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial
entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds
10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.   

In addition (as noted above), under the
previous general risk-based capital rules, the effects of AOCI items included
in shareholders  equity (for example, mark-to-market adjustments to the value
of securities held in the available for sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are
reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to
the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded;
however, non-advanced approach banking organizations may make a one-time
permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and the Bank
made the election to continue to exclude these items in order to avoid
significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of
interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolio,
concurrently with the first filing of the Company s and Oriental Bank s
periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015. The New Capital Rules
also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities,
from inclusion in bank holding companies  Tier 1 capital, subject to phase-out,
in the case of bank holding companies that had $15 billion or more in total
consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009. Therefore, the Company is permitted
to continue to include its existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1
capital.  

Implementation of the deductions and
other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a
4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per
year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will
begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each
subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  

With respect to the Bank, the New
Capital Rules revise the  prompt corrective action  ( PCA ) regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by: (i) introducing
a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized),
with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii)
increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with
the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as
compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that
provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3%
leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The New Capital Rules do
not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category.  

The New Capital Rules prescribe a new
standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting
categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and
100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on
the nature of the assets, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of
asset classes.  

126       

The following are the consolidated capital ratios
of the Company under the New Capital Rules at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015:   

127       

The following table presents a
reconciliation of the Company s total stockholders  equity to tangible common
equity and total assets to tangible assets at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015:   

The tangible
common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP
measures and, unlike Tier 1 capital and Common Equity Tier 1 capital, are not
codified in the federal banking regulations. Management and many stock analysts
use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share
in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital
adequacy of banking organizations. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible
assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for stockholders  equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Company calculates its
tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may
differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.   

Non-GAAP
financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly
applied and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, the Company has
procedures in place to calculate these measures using the appropriate GAAP or
regulatory components. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are
frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have
limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as
a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

The Company s common stock is traded on
the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol  OFG.  At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s market capitalization for its
outstanding common stock was $444.0 million ($10.11 per share) and $321.1
million ($7.32 per share), respectively.   

The following
table provides the high and low prices and dividends per share of the Company s
common stock for each quarter of the last two calendar years:   

Under the Company s current stock repurchase program it is authorized to
purchase in the open market up to $  70   million of its outstanding
shares of common stock, of which approximately $  7.7   million of authority remains. The shares of
common stock repurchased are to be held by the Company as treasury shares.
There were no repurchases during the nine-month period of 2016 and 2015.     The number of shares that may
yet be purchased under the $70 million program is estimated at 764,674 and was
calculated by dividing the remaining balance of $  7.7   million by $10.11 (closing
price of the Company common stock at September 30, 2016).

ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

Background   

The
Company s risk management policies are established by its Board of Directors
(the  Board ) and implemented by management through the adoption of a risk
management program, which is overseen and monitored by the Chief Risk Officer
and the Risk Management and Compliance Committee. The Company has continued to
refine and enhance its risk management program by strengthening policies,
processes and procedures necessary to maintain effective risk management.  

All
aspects of the Company s business activities are susceptible to risk.
Consequently, risk identification and monitoring are essential to risk
management. As more fully discussed below, the Company s primary risk exposures
include, market, interest rate, credit, liquidity, operational and
concentration risks.  

Market Risk   

Market
risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse movements in
market rates or prices, such as interest rates or prices. The Company evaluates
market risk together with interest rate risk. The Company s financial results
and capital levels are constantly exposed to market risk. The Board and
management are primarily responsible for ensuring that the market risk assumed
by the Company complies with the guidelines established by policies approved by
the Board. The Board has delegated the management of this risk to the
Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ) which is composed of certain
executive officers from the business, treasury and finance areas. One of ALCO s
primary goals is to ensure that the market risk assumed by the Company is
within the parameters established in such policies.  

Interest Rate
Risk   

Interest
rate risk is the exposure of the Company s earnings or capital to adverse
movements in interest rates. It is a predominant market risk in terms of its
potential impact on earnings. The Company manages its asset/liability position
in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on net interest
income. ALCO oversees interest rate risk, liquidity management and other
related matters.  

In
executing its responsibilities, ALCO examines current and expected conditions
in global financial markets, competition and prevailing rates in the local
deposit market, liquidity, unrealized gains and losses in securities, recent or
proposed changes to the investment portfolio, alternative funding sources and
their costs, hedging and the possible purchase of derivatives such as swaps,
and any tax or regulatory issues which may be pertinent to these areas.  

On
a quarterly basis, the Company performs a net interest income simulation
analysis on a consolidated basis to estimate the potential change in future
earnings from projected changes in interest rates. These simulations are
carried out over a five-year time horizon, assuming certain gradual upward and
downward interest rate movements, achieved during a twelve-month period.
Instantaneous interest rate movements are also modeled. Simulations are carried
out in two ways:  

(i)           using a static
balance sheet as the Company had on the simulation date, and  

(ii)         using a dynamic
balance sheet based on recent growth patterns and business strategies.  

The
balance sheet is divided into groups of assets and liabilities detailed by
maturity or re-pricing and their corresponding interest yields and costs. As
interest rates rise or fall, these simulations incorporate expected future
lending rates, current and expected future funding sources and costs, the
possible exercise of options, changes in prepayment rates, deposits decay and
other factors which may be important in projecting the future growth of net
interest income.  

The
Company uses a software application to project future movements in the
Company s balance sheet and income statement. The starting point of the
projections generally corresponds to the actual values of the balance sheet on
the date of the simulations.  

131       

These
simulations are complex, and use many assumptions that are intended to reflect
the general behavior of the Company over the period in question. There can be
no assurance that actual events will match these assumptions in all cases. For
this reason, the results of these simulations are only approximations of the
true sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates.
The following table presents the results of the simulations at  September 30,
2016  for the most likely scenario, assuming a one-year time horizon:   

The impact of -100 and
-200 basis point reductions in interest rates is not presented in view of
current level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates.   

   Future net interest
income could be affected by the Company s investments in callable securities,
prepayment risk related to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, and
any structured repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB-NY in which it
may enter into from time to time. As part of the strategy to limit the interest
rate risk and reduce the re-pricing gaps of the Company s assets and
liabilities, the Company has executed certain transactions which include extending
the maturity and the re-pricing frequency of the liabilities to longer terms
reducing the amounts of its structured repurchase agreements and entering into
hedge-designated swaps to hedge the variability of future interest cash flows
of forecasted wholesale borrowings that only consist of advances from the
FHLB-NY as of September 30, 2016 .   

   The Company maintains an
overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of
derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in
earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Company s goal is to
manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity
characteristics of certain balance sheet assets and liabilities so that the net
interest margin is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in
interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate
assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. Also, for
some fixed-rate assets or liabilities, the effect of this variability in
earnings is expected to be substantially offset by the Company s gains and
losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the forecasted cash
flows of these hedged assets and liabilities. The Company considers its
strategic use of derivatives to be a prudent method of managing interest-rate
sensitivity as it reduces the exposure of earnings and the market value of its
equity to undue risk posed by changes in interest rates. The effect of this
unrealized appreciation or depreciation is expected to be substantially offset
by the Company s gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked
to these hedged assets and liabilities. Another result of interest rate
fluctuations is that the contractual interest income and interest expense of
hedged variable-rate assets and liabilities, respectively, will increase or
decrease.   

   Derivative instruments
that are used as part of the Company s interest risk management strategy
include interest rate swaps, forward-settlement swaps, futures contracts, and
option contracts that have indices related to the pricing of specific balance
sheet assets and liabilities. Interest rate swaps generally involve the
exchange of fixed and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based
on a common notional principal amount and maturity date. Interest rate futures
generally involve exchanged-traded contracts to buy or sell U.S. Treasury bonds
and notes in the future at specified prices. Interest rate options represent contracts
that allow the holder of the option to (i) receive cash or (ii) purchase, sell,
or enter into a financial instrument at a specified price within a specified
period. Some purchased option contracts give the Company the right to enter
into interest rate swaps and cap and floor agreements with the writer of the
option. In addition, the Company enters into certain transactions that contain
embedded derivatives. When the embedded derivative possesses economic
characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic
characteristics of the host contract, it is bifurcated and carried at fair
value. Please refer to Note 7 to the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements for further information concerning the Company s
derivative activities.   

132       

Following is a summary of certain strategies, including derivative
activities, currently used by the Company to manage interest rate risk:   

    Interest rate swaps        The Company entered
into hedge-designated swaps to hedge the variability of future interest cash
flows of forecasted wholesale borrowings attributable to changes in the
one-month LIBOR rate. Once the forecasted wholesale          borrowings transactions
occurred, the interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company s interest
payments on an amount of forecasted interest expense attributable to the
one-month LIBOR rate corresponding to the swap notional stated rate. A
derivative liability of $2.8 million (notional amount of $36.9 million) was
recognized at September 30, 2016 related to the valuation of these swaps.    

   In addition, the
Company has certain derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps not
designated as hedging instruments, which are utilized to convert certain
variable rate loans to fixed-rate loans, and the mirror-images of these
interest rate swaps in which the Company enters into to minimize its interest
rate risk exposure that results from offering the derivatives to clients. These
interest rate swaps are marked to market through earnings. At September     30, 2016    , interest rate swaps offered to clients not designated as
hedging instruments represented a derivative asset of $1.4 million (notional
amounts of $12.5 million), and the mirror-image interest rate swaps in which
the Company entered into represented a derivative liability of $1.4 million
(notional amounts of $12.5 million).    

Wholesale borrowings        The Company uses
interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest cash flows of certain
advances from the FHLB-NY that are tied to a variable rate index. The interest
rate swaps effectively fix the Company s interest payments on these borrowings.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $36.9 million in interest rate swaps
at an average rate of 2.4% designated as cash flow hedges for $36.9 million in
advances from the FHLB-NY that reprice or are being rolled over on a monthly
basis.    

    Credit Risk    

   Credit risk is the
possibility of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty in a credit-related
contract failing to perform in accordance with its terms. The principal source
of credit risk for the Company is its lending activities. In Puerto Rico, the
Company s principal market, economic conditions are challenging, as they have
been for the last ten years, due to a shrinking population, a protracted
economic recession, a housing sector that remains under pressure, the Puerto
Rico government s fiscal and liquidity crisis, and the recent credit or payment
defaults on certain Puerto Rico government bonds, with additional defaults
expected if the Puerto Rico government is unable to restructure its debts
and/or access the capital markets to place new debt or refinance its upcoming
maturities.     

   The Company manages its
credit risk through a comprehensive credit policy which establishes sound
underwriting standards by monitoring and evaluating loan portfolio quality, and
by the constant assessment of reserves and loan concentrations. The Company
also employs proactive collection and loss mitigation practices.   

   The Company may also
encounter risk of default in relation to its securities portfolio. The
securities held by the Company are principally agency mortgage-backed
securities. Thus, a substantial portion of these instruments are guaranteed by
mortgages, a U.S. government-sponsored entity, or the full faith and credit of
the U.S. government.    

   The Company s Executive
Credit Committee, composed of its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Risk
Officer and other senior executives, has primary responsibility for setting
strategies to achieve the Company s credit risk goals and objectives. Those goals
and objectives are set forth in the Company s Credit Policy as approved by the
Board.   

    Liquidity Risk    

   Liquidity risk is the
risk of the Company not being able to generate sufficient cash from either
assets or liabilities to meet obligations as they become due without incurring
substantial losses. The Board has established a policy to          manage this risk. The
Company s cash requirements principally consist of deposit withdrawals,
contractual loan funding, repayment of borrowings as these mature, and funding
of new and existing investments as required.   

133       

The Company s business requires continuous
access to various funding sources. While the Company is able to fund its
operations through deposits as well as through advances from the FHLB-NY and
other alternative sources, the Company s business is dependent upon other
external wholesale funding sources. Although the Company has selectively
reduced its use of wholesale funding sources, such as repurchase agreements and
brokered deposits, it is still dependent on wholesale funding sources. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had $656.6 million in repurchase agreements,
excluding accrued interest, and $581.2 million in brokered deposits    .   

Brokered deposits are
typically offered through an intermediary to small retail investors. The
Company s ability to continue to attract brokered deposits is subject to
variability based upon a number of factors, including volume and volatility in
the global securities markets, the Company s credit rating, and the relative
interest rates that it is prepared to pay for these liabilities. Brokered
deposits are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core
deposits obtained through retail bank branches. Investors in brokered deposits
are generally more sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds
from one depository institution to another based on small differences in
interest rates offered on deposits.   

   Although the Company
expects to have continued access to credit from the foregoing sources of funds,
there can be no assurance that such financing sources will continue to be
available or will be available on favorable terms. In a period of financial
disruption or if negative developments occur with respect to the Company, the
availability and cost of the Company s funding sources could be adversely
affected. In that event, the Company s cost of funds may increase, thereby
reducing its net interest income, or the Company may need to dispose of a
portion of its investment portfolio, which depending upon market conditions,
could result in realizing a loss or experiencing other adverse accounting
consequences upon any such dispositions. The Company s efforts to monitor and
manage liquidity risk may not be successful to deal with dramatic or
unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other reductions in
liquidity driven by the Company or market-related events. In the event that
such sources of funds are reduced or eliminated and the Company is not able to replace
these on a cost-effective basis, the Company may be forced to curtail or cease
its loan origination business and treasury activities, which would have a
material adverse effect on its operations and financial condition.   

   As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had approximately $509.3 million in unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents, $494.9 million in investment securities that are not pledged as
collateral, and $1.083 million in borrowing capacity at the FHLB-NY available
to cover liquidity needs.   

         Operational Risk    

   Operational risk is the
risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel and
systems or from external events. All functions, products and services of the
Company are susceptible to operational risk.    

   The Company faces ongoing
and emerging risk and regulatory pressure related to the activities that
surround the delivery of banking and financial products and services. Coupled
with external influences such as market conditions, security risks, and legal
risk, the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased. In
order to mitigate and control operational risk, the Company has developed, and
continues to enhance, specific internal controls, policies and procedures that
are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels
throughout the organization. The purpose of these policies and procedures is to
provide reasonable assurance that the Company s business operations are
functioning within established limits.   

   The Company classifies
operational risk into two major categories: business specific and
corporate-wide affecting all business lines. For business specific risks, a
risk assessment group works with the various business units to ensure
consistency in policies, processes and assessments. With respect to
corporate-wide risks, such as information security, business recovery, legal
and compliance, the Company has specialized groups, such as Information
Security, Enterprise Risk Management, Corporate Compliance, Information
Technology, Legal and Operations. These groups assist the lines of business in
the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the
needs of the business groups. All these matters are reviewed and discussed in
the Information Technology Steering Committee, and the Executive Risk and
Compliance Committee.   

   The Company is subject to
extensive United States federal and Puerto Rico regulations, and this
regulatory scrutiny has been significantly increasing over the last several
years. The Company has established and continues to enhance procedures based on
legal       

134       

and regulatory requirements that are reasonably
designed to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory
requirements. The Company has a corporate compliance function headed by a Chief
Compliance Officer who reports to the CEO and the BSA Officer who reports to
the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for the
oversight of regulatory compliance and implementation of a company-wide
compliance program, except for the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering
compliance program, which is overseen and implemented by the BSA Officer.   

    Concentration Risk    

   Substantially all of the
Company s business activities and a significant portion of its credit exposure
are concentrated in Puerto Rico. As a consequence, the Company s profitability
and financial condition may be adversely affected by an extended economic slowdown,
adverse political or economic developments in Puerto Rico or the effects of a
natural disaster, all of which could result in a reduction in loan
originations, an increase in non-performing assets, an increase in foreclosure
losses on mortgage loans, and a reduction in the value of its loans and loan
servicing portfolio.   

ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     

Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

As of the end of
the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was
carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Chief
Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon such
evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of the end of such
period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable
assurance of effectiveness in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting,
on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that it will detect or uncover
failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required
to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports.   

Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There have not
been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.   

135       

PART - II OTHER
INFORMATION     

    ITEM 1     .   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     

   The Company and its
subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings incidental to
their business. The Company is vigorously contesting such claims. Based upon a
review by legal counsel and the development of these matters to date, management
is of the opinion that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, resulting from
these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial
condition or results of operations.   

     ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS      

   There have been no material changes to the risk factors
previously disclosed in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. In addition to other information set forth in this
report, you should carefully consider the risk factors included in the
Company s annual report on Form 10-K, as updated by this report or other
filings the Company makes with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to the Company at this time or that the
Company currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect the Company s
business, financial condition or results of operations.

EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT   

   BETWEEN   

   OFG BANCORP   

   AND   

   JOS  RAFAEL FERN NDEZ   

This Employment
Agreement (the  Agreement ) is made and entered into on  the 27th day of
September 2016 , by and between    OFG BANCORP   , a financial holding company
that has its principal office in San Juan, Puerto Rico (the  Company ), and    JOS 
RAFAEL FERN NDEZ    (the  President and CEO  or  Mr. Fern ndez ).  

WITNESSETH:   

WHEREAS   ,
Mr. Fern ndez has been an executive officer of the Company since June 1991, is
presently the Company s President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman
of the Board of Directors, and the retention of his services for and on behalf
of the Company is of material importance to the preservation and enhancement of
the value of the Company's business;  

WHEREAS   ,
the Company and the President and CEO wish to enter into this Agreement and
intend that this Agreement shall become effective on July 1, 2016 (the
 Effective Date ), and replace the Employment Agreement, dated July 1, 2016,
between the Company and the President and CEO, which is now in effect;  

NOW
THEREFORE   , in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
set forth, the Company and the President and CEO do hereby agree as follows:  

   1.                      
    TERM OF EMPLOYMENT   

1.1       
   The
Company hereby employs Mr. Fern ndez as its President and Chief Executive
Officer, and Mr. Fern ndez hereby accepts said employment and agrees to render
such services to the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement for a term of three (3) years commencing on the Effective Date and
terminating on June 30, 2019, unless further extended or sooner terminated in
accordance with the terms and conditions herein set forth.  

Unless
written notice of non-renewal is given by either party not less than one
hundred twenty (120) days in advance of the expiration of the term, this
Agreement will be automatically extended for one (1) additional year.  Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Mr. Fern ndez and the Company, and except in
the event of a termination for just cause pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof or a
removal or bar from office pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof, Mr. Fern ndez shall
remain as an employee of the Company after the expiration of the term of this
Agreement and shall be entitled to all the rights and benefits of an employee
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  

1.2       
   During
the term of this Agreement, the President and CEO shall devote his best efforts
to performing such services for the Company as may be consistent with his title
of President and Chief Executive Officer and those which from time to time may
be assigned to him by the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board of
Directors ).  

1.3          
The services of the President and CEO to the Company shall be rendered
principally in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but he shall do such traveling
on behalf of the Company as may be reasonably required by his duties.  

1.4          
The President and CEO shall report directly to the Board of Directors and shall
have overall responsibility for all of the business and affairs of the Company,
including making all determinations concerning hiring, dismissal and
compensation for all classes of employees of the Company (exception in the case
of the Head of the Company s Internal Audit Department), which determinations
shall be in accordance with the policies for such hiring, dismissal and
compensation established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors (the  Compensation Committee ) from time to time and in accordance
with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the applicable
regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ), the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  FRB ), the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and the Office of the Commissioner of
Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the  OCFI ).  

1.5          
The President and CEO shall continue to occupy his position as Vice Chairperson
of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, during the term of this Agreement and
any extension thereof, and in any election of directors in which his term as a
member of the Board of Directors will expire, the Board of Directors shall
nominate and recommend to the Company s stockholders the election of Mr.
Fern ndez to the Board of Directors and, if elected, the Board of Directors
shall appoint him as its Vice Chairperson.  It is further provided that in the
event that Mr. Julian S. Incl n ceases, for any reason, to be the Chairperson
of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors shall appoint Mr. Fern ndez
as its Chairperson.  It is understood and agreed that the Board s commitment to
appoint Mr. Fern ndez Chairperson as set forth above shall be in effect only
while this Agreement is in effect, and that this provision does not establish
an acquired right to such appointment in favor of Mr. Fern ndez following the
termination of this Agreement.  

2.                      
    COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES   

2.1          
The President and CEO agrees that during the term of this Agreement, except
with the express written consent of the Board of Directors, he will not,
directly or indirectly, engage or participate in, become a director of, or
render advisory or other services for, or in connection with, or become
interested in, or make financial investment in any firm, corporation, business
entity or business enterprise; provided, however, that the President and CEO
shall not thereby be precluded or prohibited from owning passive investments
including investments in the securities of other financial institutions, so
long as such ownership does not require him to devote substantial time to
management or control of the business or activities in which he has invested.  

2.2          
The President and CEO agrees and acknowledges that during the time that he is
employed by the Company, he will maintain an intimate knowledge of the
activities and affairs of the Company including trade secrets and other
confidential matters.  As a result, and also because of the special, unique,
and extraordinary services that the President and CEO is capable of performing
for the Company or one of its competitors, the President and CEO recognizes
that the services to be rendered by him hereunder are of a character giving
them a peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be adequately or reasonably
compensated for by damages.  Therefore, if during the time he is employed by
the Company, the President and CEO renders services to a competitor of the
Company other than as authorized pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, the Company
shall be entitled to immediate injunctive or other equitable relief to restrain
the President and CEO from rendering his services to the competitor of the
Company, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled
under law; provided, however, that the right to such injunctive or other
equitable relief shall not survive the termination of the President and CEO s
employment with the Company.  

3.        COMPENSATION
AND REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES   

3.1

(b)   
   Not later than March 31 of each contract year, the Compensation Committee
shall evaluate and determine the amount of any increase to the President and
CEO s annual base salary.  Any increases to the President and CEO s annual base
salary determined by the Compensation Committee shall be effective on January 1

become the President and CEO s new contractual annual base salary.  

3.2

President and CEO an annual target bonus of one hundred percent ( 100%) of his

commencing with the bonus corresponding to calendar year 2016 due and payable

eighty five thousand dollars ($85,000) from which the President and CEO shall
pay his (i) car-related expenses; (ii) membership expenses for social, business
or professional organizations (all such membership(s) shall be maintained in
the name of the President and CEO); and (iii) any other expenses which, in his
judgment, are reasonably appropriate for the performance of his duties under
this Agreement.  

3.4          
    Reimbursement of Expenses    .  Not less frequently than monthly, the
Company shall pay for or reimburse the President and CEO for all reasonable
travel and other expenses incurred by the President and CEO in the performance
of his duties under this Agreement, including, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Expense Allowance provided for in Section 3.3 above.  

3.5       
     Life Insurance    .  The Company shall renew for an
additional ten (10) year term the existing ten (10) year term life insurance
policy in the sum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) covering the life of
the President and CEO and having as its beneficiary the spouse and heirs of Mr.
Fern ndez; provided, that the President and CEO may designate in writing from
to time any other person or entity as its beneficiary.  For as long as the
President and CEO is employed by the Company, all premiums and costs associated
with such term life insurance policy  shall be for the account of the Company.  

3.6       
     Vacation    .  The President and CEO shall be
entitled to twenty-five (25) days of paid vacation each year during the term of
this Agreement.  

4.        DISABILITY   

4.1

incapacitated to the extent that he is unable to perform his duties under this
Agreement, and so long as such disability continues, the President and CEO
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 6.2 and 6.3 hereof, and for a
period not to exceed the remaining term of this Agreement, continue to receive
his full compensation, as set forth in Section 3 hereof, including an annual
cash bonus equal to the annual cash bonus paid to him in the last fiscal year prior
to his disability or incapacitation.  

4.2          
There shall be deducted from the amounts paid to the President and CEO
hereunder during any period of disability or incapacitation, as described in
Section 4.1 hereof, any amounts actually paid to the President and CEO pursuant
to any disability insurance or other similar program(s) which the Company has
instituted or may institute on behalf of its employees for the purpose of
providing compensation in the event of disability.  

5.        ADDITIONAL
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

During the term of this Agreement, the President and CEO will be entitled to
participate in, and receive the benefits of, any equity-based compensation

employees and executives of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates
which may now exist or come into existence hereinafter, to the extent
commensurate with his then duties and responsibilities, as fixed by the
Compensation Committee, and, to the extent that the President and CEO is
otherwise eligible and qualifies, to so participate in, and receive such
benefits or privileges.  The Company shall not make any changes in such plans,
benefits or privileges which would adversely affect the President and CEO s
rights or benefits there under, unless such change or changes are made pursuant
to a program applicable to all executives of the Company and does not result in
a proportionately greater adverse change in the rights of or benefits to the
President and CEO as compared to any executive officer of the Company.  Nothing

or made available in the future shall be deemed in lieu of the annual base
salary, Incentive Bonus, Special Bonus, Expense Allowance and term life
insurance payable or provided to the President and CEO pursuant to Sections
3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5 hereof.

Bonus to Mr. Fern ndez in six equal semi-annual installments with the first
such installment to be paid on December 31, 2016, and the final such
installment to be paid on June 30, 2019. If Mr. Fern ndez employment is
terminated for any reason before the expiration of the term of this Agreement
(other than termination caused by the death or disability of Mr. Fern ndez),
then he shall not be entitled to receive any further installments of the
Special Bonus.   

(b)
The Compensation Committee shall consider in each contract year of this
Agreement granting the President and CEO additional incentive compensation

scorecard, as approved by the Compensation Committee, up to an annual amount
equal to eighty five percent (85%) of his annual base salary. The incentive
compensation grants to the President and CEO shall be made on or before March
31 of each contract year of this Agreement commencing with the year 2017. As
long as he is in compliance with the requirements of the Company s Stock
Ownership Policy, with respect to any incentive compensation award granted to
him by the Compensation Committee, the President and CEO shall have the option
of electing to receive the award in deferred cash equivalents.

6.        TERMINATION   

6.1          
The Board of Directors shall have the right, at any time upon prior written
Notice of Termination (as defined in Section 6.8(b) hereof), to terminate the
President and CEO s employment hereunder for just cause or in connection with a
removal or bar from office pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof.  For purposes of
this Agreement, the term  termination for just cause  shall mean termination
because of the willful and continued failure of the President and CEO to
perform his duties under this Agreement, or the willful engaging by the
President and CEO in illegal conduct or gross misconduct materially injurious
to the Company as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or a federal
or state regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the Company.  For purposes
of this paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on the part of the President and
CEO shall be considered  willful  unless done, or omitted to be done, by him
not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was
in the best interest of the Company; provided, however, that any act or
omission to act by the President and CEO in reliance upon an opinion of counsel
to the Company or counsel to the President and CEO shall not be deemed to be
willful.  

6.2          
In the event the President and CEO s employment is terminated for just cause
pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof or he is removed or barred from office pursuant
to Section 6.5 hereof, the President and CEO shall have no right to
compensation or other benefits for any period after such date of termination. 
If the President and CEO is terminated by the Company other than for just cause
pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, other than in connection with a removal or bar
from office pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof, and      

other
than in connection with a Change of Control of the Company, as defined in the
Change in Control Compensation Agreement, the President and CEO s right to
compensation and other benefits under this Agreement shall be as set forth in
Sections 6.8(d) hereof.  

6.3          
The President and CEO shall have the right, upon prior written Notice of
Termination of not less than thirty (30) days, to terminate his employment hereunder. 
In such event, the President and CEO shall have the right, as of the date of
termination, to receive all accrued compensation and other benefits provided
for in this Agreement.  

6.4          
If the President and CEO is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited
from participating in the conduct of the Company s affairs pursuant to a notice
served under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ( FDIA ), the Federal Reserve
Act ( FRA ), the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the  BHCA ), the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the  SEA ), or the Puerto Rico Banking Act (the  PRBA ),
each as amended from time to time, the Company s obligations under this
Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service unless stayed by
appropriate proceedings.  If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the
Company shall:  (i) pay the President and CEO all the compensation withheld
while contractual obligations were suspended, and (ii) reinstate in whole or in
part, as applicable, any of the Company s obligations which were suspended.  

6.5          
If the President and CEO is removed from office and/or permanently prohibited
from participating in the conduct of the Company s affairs by an order issued
under the FDIA, the FRA, the BHCA, the SEA, or the PRBA all obligations of the
Company under this Agreement shall terminate, as of the effective date of the
order, but the rights of the President and CEO to compensation earned as of the
date of termination shall not be affected.  

6.6          
If the Company is in default, as defined to mean an adjudication or other
official determination of a court of competent jurisdiction or other public
authority pursuant to which a conservator, receiver or other legal custodian is
appointed for the Company for the purpose of liquidation, all obligations under
this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but the rights of the
President and CEO to compensation and benefits accrued as of the date of
termination shall not be affected.  

6.7          
In the event that the President and CEO is terminated in a manner which
violates the provisions of Section 6.1 hereof, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the President and CEO shall be entitled to
reimbursement for all reasonable costs, including attorneys  fees, in
challenging such termination.  Such reimbursement shall be in addition to all
rights to which the President and CEO is otherwise entitled under this
Agreement.  

6.8       
   (a)    
   Reserved.   

(b)
Any termination of the President and CEO s employment by the Company or by the
President and CEO shall be communicated by a written Notice of Termination to
the other party hereto.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Notice of
Termination  shall mean a dated notice which shall (i) indicate the specific
termination provision in the Agreement relied upon; (ii) set forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
termination of the President and CEO s employment under the provision so
indicated; (iii) specify a date of termination, which shall be not less than
thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days after such Notice of Termination is
given, except in the case of the Company s termination of the President and
CEO s employment for just cause pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof or in connection
with a removal or bar from office pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof, in which case
the Notice of Termination may specify a date of termination as of the date such
Notice of Termination is given; and (iv) be given in the manner specified in
Section 9.1 hereof.  

(c)
Reserved.  

(d)
Reserved.   

  (e)
The President and CEO shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any
payment provided for in paragraph (d) of this Section 6.8 by seeking other
employment or otherwise.  

7.        INDEMNIFICATION   

7.l       
   The
Company shall indemnify the President and CEO to the fullest extent authorized
by applicable federal and Commonwealth of Puerto Rico laws and regulations
(including 12 C.F.R. part 359), with respect to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) that
