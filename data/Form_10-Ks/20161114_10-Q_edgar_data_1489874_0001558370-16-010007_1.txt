NOTE 4   INVESTMENTS 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Quoted market prices are generally not available for the Company s financial instruments.  Fair values are based on judgments regarding anticipated cash flows, future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.  These estimates involve uncertainties and matters of judgment, and therefore, cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Overview 

Golden Growers Cooperative is a value added agricultural cooperative association governed under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 308B owned by 1,547 members in the business of providing value to our members by facilitating their delivery of corn to the corn wet-milling facility owned by ProGold Limited Liability Company ( ProGold LLC ), a Minnesota limited liability company in which the Cooperative owns a 49% membership interest.  ProGold LLC leases its corn wet milling facility to Cargill Incorporated ( Cargill ) who uses the facility to process corn into high fructose corn syrup.  We accomplish our business on behalf of our members through our contract relationships with all of the parties involved in the ownership and operation of the facility.  From an income production perspective, our membership interest in ProGold LLC is our primary asset that, in addition to giving us the right to receive distributions from ProGold LLC, also provides our members with additional value for the delivery of their corn for processing.  Annually, we are required to deliver approximately 15,490,480 bushels of corn to Cargill for processing at the ProGold LLC facility. 

Any person residing in the United States can own our Units as long as that person delivers or provides for the delivery of corn for processing at the ProGold LLC facility. Ownership of our membership units requires our members to deliver corn to the Cooperative for processing in proportion to the number of units each member holds. Currently, 15,490,480 of our units are issued and outstanding.  The Cooperative s income and losses are allocated to our members based on the volume of corn they deliver.  Subject to certain limitations, as long as a member patronizes the Cooperative by delivering corn equal to the number of units held by the member, the member will be allocated a corresponding portion of our income (or loss).  In this way, we operate on a cooperative basis. 

To hold our units, a member is required to execute a Uniform Member Agreement that obligates the member to deliver corn to us and an Annual Delivery Agreement by which each member annually elects the member s method to deliver corn   either Method A or Method B, or a combination of both.  Under Method A, a member is required to physically deliver the required bushels of corn to us either at the facility or another location designated by the Cooperative.  Under Method B, a member appoints us as its agent to arrange for the acquisition and delivery of the required bushels of corn on the member s behalf.  We appoint Cargill as our agent to arrange for the delivery of the corn by our members who elect to deliver corn using Method A, and we appoint Cargill as our agent to acquire corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver corn using Method B.  If a member elects to deliver corn using Method B, the price per bushel the Cooperative pays to the member is equal to the price per bushel paid by Cargill to acquire the corn as our agent.  Members who deliver corn under Method A are paid the market price or contracted price for their corn at the time of delivery.  Members who deliver corn under Method A receive from the Cooperative an incentive payment of $.05 per bushel on the corn that they deliver while members who elect Method B to deliver corn pay to the Cooperative a $.02 per bushel agency fee for the cost of having us deliver corn on their behalf.  The incentive payment for Method A deliveries and the agency fee for Method B deliveries are subject to annual adjustment at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. While the Cooperative is financially responsible for the various payments to the members for corn, Cargill, serving as the Cooperative s administrative agent, issues payments to members for corn on the Cooperative s behalf. 

Annually, we notify Cargill of the volume of Method A corn to be delivered by each Method A member.  Once we provide notification to Cargill of the volume of corn, Cargill then confirms the amount of corn with each member and notifies that member with respect to quality specifications, allowances, deductions and premiums to be applicable to that corn.  The Method A member then directly contracts with Cargill for the contract price agreed upon for the corn or, in the absence of an agreed upon price, the market price per bushel for corn delivered on the day on which the corn is delivered and accepted at the facility.  With respect to all Method A corn that is delivered, Cargill pays to the   

7 

Table of Contents  

Cooperative the aggregate purchase price for corn purchased from our members, and then, on our behalf, makes individual payments for corn directly to our members.  In the event a Method A member delivers to Cargill more than its delivery commitment, any corn delivered in excess of that commitment is handled as a direct sale of corn to Cargill and is priced at the current closing delivery corn price established by Cargill at the facility on the day it is unloaded.  In the event a Method A member delivers to Cargill less than its committed amount of corn, the quantity of the shortfall is then purchased and delivered by Cargill on our behalf, but this purchased corn is not credited to the Method A member s account.  If a Method A member fails to fully satisfy the corn delivery requirement, Cargill purchases replacement corn for which we reimburse Cargill the amount by which the underlying contracted corn price is less than the price of buying the replacement corn that was due on the delivery date.  In addition, if a Method A member fails to deliver all of the corn it was obligated to deliver, that member s allocation of our profit or losses and any cash distributions is proportionately reduced and we may terminate the member s membership. 

Our Bylaws establish a Method A delivery pool and a Method B delivery pool.  Generally, our income and/or losses are allocated annually based on the percentage of bushels of corn our members elect to deliver using either Method A or Method B.  Regardless of the actual percentage allocation between our members who deliver bushels of corn using Method A or Method B, our Bylaws require us to annually allocate at least 25% of our income and/or losses to the Method A pool.  The amount of our income and/or losses actually allocated to the Method A pool is a percentage equal to the greater of 25% or the actual percentage of bushels of corn delivered by our members using Method A. 

For the 2016 fiscal year, 29% of members elected to deliver corn by Method A and 71% elected to deliver corn by Method B.  This election will result in 29% of the Cooperative s income and/or losses and 29% of any cash distributions being allocated to the Method A pool in fiscal year 2016, which reflects the actual percentage of members who elected to deliver corn using Method A and does not result in reallocation to meet the 25% requirement set forth in our governing documents. 

Results of Operations 

Revenues  . The Cooperative derives revenue from two sources: operations related to the marketing of members  corn and income derived from the Cooperative s membership interest in ProGold LLC.  The corn marketing operations generate revenue for the Cooperative equal to the value of the corn that is delivered to Cargill. The Cooperative recognizes expense equal to this same amount which results in the corn marketing operations being revenue neutral to the Cooperative, except for revenue from the Method B agency fee and expenses related to the Method A incentive payments, required licensing and bonding expenses, and the service fee paid to Cargill. 

For the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Cooperative sold approximately 3.7 million and 11.8 million bushels of corn compared to 3.6 million and 11.7 million bushels of corn sold during the same respective periods in 2015.  For the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Cooperative recognized corn revenue of $12,664,000 and $43,466,000 compared to $11,554,000 and $46,469,000 during the same respective periods in 2015, an increase of 10% for the third quarter, and a decrease of 6% year-to-date due primarily to changes in the selling price per bushel of corn sold in 2016 compared to 2015. 

Expenses.   The Cooperative recognized corn expense of $12,699,000 and $43,545,000 for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11,587,000 and $46,546,000 during the same respective periods in 2015, an increase of 10% for the third quarter, and a decrease of 6% year-to-date due primarily to changes in the cost per bushel of corn purchased in 2016 compared to 2015.  For the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Cooperative s members, on the Cooperative s behalf, delivered to Cargill for processing at the facility 935,827 and 3,458,984 bushels of corn using Method A and 2,772,586 and 8,359,928 bushels of corn using Method B. In the same respective periods in 2015, the Cooperative s members, on the Cooperative s behalf, delivered to Cargill for processing at the facility 880,144 and 3,396,746 bushels of corn using Method A and 2,765,546 and 8,352,763 bushels of corn using Method B. The Cooperative recognized expense of $23,000 and $69,000 for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $23,000 and $69,000 during the same respective periods in 2015 in connection with costs incurred to Cargill related to the Cooperative s corn marketing operation. 

Income from ProGold LLC  . The Cooperative derived income from ProGold LLC for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 of $1,309,000 and $4,068,000 compared to $1,407,000 and $3,797,000 during the same respective periods in 2015. 

General and Administrative Expenses  . The Cooperative s general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits, professional fees and fees paid to our board of directors. The general and administrative expenses for the   

8 

Table of Contents  

three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $104,000 and $447,000 compared to $138,000 and $490,000 during the same respective periods in 2015. 

Interest Income  . Interest income for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $2,000 and $6,000 compared to $2,000 and $6,000 during the same respective periods in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Cooperative s working capital at September 30, 2016 was $639,000 compared to $29,000 at September 30, 2015. 

The Cooperative had no long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

The Cooperative used operating cash flows of $1,069,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $559,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash used for operating activities related to the timing of cash receipts for corn purchases and sales. 

The Cooperative received cash distributions from ProGold LLC totaling $8,077,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8,109,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

The Cooperative paid cash distributions to its members totaling $6,196,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,662,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

Management believes that non-cash working capital levels are appropriate in the current business environment and will satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Management does not expect a significant increase or reduction of non-cash working capital in the next 12-months. 

Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The Cooperative generally does not pay out Method A incentive payments or collect Method B agency fees until the end of its fiscal year.  These amounts are accrued quarterly and then confirmed at the end of the fiscal year.  The total annual Method B agency fee was determinable once the members completed their delivery method determination prior to January 1, 2016.  The quarterly Method B bushel delivery and agency fee revenue is calculated by allocating the portion of the total annual agency fee for that particular quarter or cumulating it for the particular period.  The Cooperative tracks Method A corn deliveries throughout the year so it can report the bushels of corn delivered by its members as well as the corresponding Method A incentive fees earned.  The final amounts owed by or due to Cargill and/or the Cooperative s members who elect to deliver using Method A is not calculated until after December 31 in order to account for any failures to deliver or over-deliveries of corn. 

The remainder of the Cooperative s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2,   Summary of Significant Accounting Polices  , of the Notes to the Financial Statements included in the Cooperative s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015.  The Cooperative s critical accounting estimates are discussed in Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations  , included in the Cooperative s Annual Report Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  There has been no significant change in the Cooperative s significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since the end of fiscal 2015. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument.  The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes.  Market risk is attributed to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, including long term debt. 

Due to the pass through nature of the Cooperative s marketing of its members  corn, the Cooperative does not believe that it is subject to any material market risk exposure with respect to interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that would require disclosure under this item. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   

The Cooperative s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Cooperative s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 240.13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2016.  Based on that review and evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that the Cooperative s current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, are effective and provide reasonable assurance that

information relating to the Cooperative required to be disclosed in the reports the Cooperative files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Cooperative s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There were no changes in the Cooperative s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Cooperative s most recent fiscal quarter that may have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Cooperative s internal control over financial reporting.
