Note 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Business Description 

Micropac Industries, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, manufactures and distributes various types of hybrid microelectronic circuits, solid state relays, power controllers, and optoelectronic components and assemblies.  The Company's products are used as components in a broad range of military, space and industrial systems, including aircraft instrumentation and navigation systems, power supplies, electronic controls, computers, medical devices, and high-temperature (200 o  C) products.

In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of only normal, recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position as of August 27, 2016, the results of operations for the three months and nine months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, and the cash flows for the nine months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015. Unaudited financial statements are prepared on a basis substantially consistent with those audited for the year ended November 30, 2015. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The  Company's fiscal year ends on the last day of November.

It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the November 30, 2015 Form 10-K filed with the SEC, including the audited financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto.

Note 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition 

Sales are recorded as shipments are made based upon contract prices.  Any losses anticipated on fixed price contracts are provided for currently.  Sales are recorded net of sales returns, allowances and discounts.

The Company recognizes sales when  four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) shipment has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.

Deferred revenue represents prepayments from customers and will be recognized as sales when the products are shipped per the terms of the contract.

Short-Term Investments 

The Company has $2,011,000 in short term investments at August 27, 2016. Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposits with initial maturities greater than 90 days.  These investments are reported at historical cost, which approximates fair value. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of 90 days or less are classified as cash equivalents.  All short-term investments are securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity and mature within one year.

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market value and include material, labor and manufacturing overhead.  All inventories are valued using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method of inventory valuation. The Company determines the need to write inventory  down below its cost via an analysis based on the usage of inventory over a three year period and projected usage based on current backlog.

6 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method the Company records deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. The resulting deferred tax liabilities and assets are adjusted to reflect changes in tax law or rates in the period that includes the enactment date.

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost, and depreciation is provided using the straight-line method at rates based upon the following estimated useful lives (in years) of the assets:

Construction in process is carried at cost and depreciated when the asset is placed in service.

The Company assesses long-lived assets for when events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset's net book value to determine if a write down to market value less cost to sell is required.

Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Improvements which extend the useful life of property, plant, and equipment are capitalized.

Research and Development Costs 

Costs for the design and development of new products and processes are expensed as incurred.

Note 3 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. ASU No. 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. On July 9, 2015 the FASB agreed to defer the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and the interim periods within that year. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.

Note 4   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company had no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 27, 2016 and November 30, 2015.  The fair value of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their carrying amount based on the short maturity of these instruments.  There were no nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at August 27, 2016 and November 30, 2015.

Note 5 COMMITMENTS

On April 23, 2016, the Company renewed the Loan Agreement with a Texas banking institution.  The Loan Agreement provides for revolving credit loans , in amounts not to exceed a total principal balance of $6,000,000, and specific advance loans for acquisitions with an aggregate amount not to exceed $7,500,000 in a single advance or in multiple advances.  The Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants to m aintain at all times including (i) minimum working capital of not less than $4,000,000, (ii) a ratio of senior funded debt, minus the Company's balance sheet cash on hand to the extent in excess of $2,000,000 to EBITDA of not more than 3.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a ratio of free cash flow to debt service of not less than 1.2 to 1.0. The Company has not, to date, drawn any amounts under the loan agreement or the revolving line of credit and is currently in compliance with the financial covenants.

Note 6 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares. For the three months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, the Company had no dilutive potential common stock.

Note 7 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

On December 16, 2014, the Board of Directors of Micropac Industries, Inc. approved the payment of a special dividend of $0.10 per share for shareholders of record as of January 12, 2015.  The dividend was paid to  shareholders on February 1 0 , 2015 .

ITEM 2. 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Business 

Micropac Industries, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, manufactures and distributes various types of hybrid microelectronic circuits, solid state relays, power controllers, and optoelectronic components and assemblies.  The Company's products are used as components in a broad range of military, space and industrial systems, including aircraft instrumentation and navigation systems, power supplies, electronic controls, computers, medical devices, and high-temperature (200 o  C) products.  The Company's products are either custom (being application specific circuits designed and manufactured to meet the particular requirements of a single customer) or standard, proprietary components such as catalog items.

The Company's facilities are certified and qualified by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to MIL-PRF-38534 (class K-space level), MIL-PRF-19500 JANS (space level), and MIL-PRF-28750 (class K-space level) and is certified to ISO 9001-2002.

The Company has UL, LLC (UL) approval on the new isolated solid state industrial power controllers.

The Company's core technology is the packaging and interconnecting of miniature electronic components, utilizing thick film substrates, forming microelectronics circuits. Other technologies include light emitting and light sensitive materials and products, including light emitting diodes and silicon phototransistors used in the Company's optoelectronic components and assemblies.

Results of Operations 

Sales for the three and nine month periods ended August 27, 2016 totaled $3,804,000 and $13,120,000, respectively.  Sales for the third quarter decreased 27.8% or $1,464,000 below sales for the same period of 2015, while sales for the first nine months of 2016 decreased 14.4% or $2,199,000 below the first nine months of 2015 with lower sales of standard solid state relays and standard optocouplers. Sales were 16% in the commercial market, 56% in the military market, and 28% in the space market for the nine months ended August 27, 2016 compared to 15% in the commercial market, 59% in the military market, and 26% in the space market for the nine months ended August 29, 2015.

9 

One customer accounted for 15% of the Company's sales for the three months ended August 27, 2016 and two customers accounted for 20% and 12% each of the Company's sales for the nine months ended August 27, 2016, while two customers accounted for 18% and 11% of the Company's sales for the three months ended August 29, 2015, and two customers accounted for 17% and 13% of the Company's sales for the nine months ended August 29, 2015.

Cost of goods sold for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 totaled 70.9% and 61.3% of net sales, respectively, while cost of goods sold for the nine months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 totaled 66.9% and 60.4% of net sales, respectively. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales resulted in lower gross margins associated with the lower sales of standard products and cost overruns on one customer funded project. In actual dollars, cost of goods sold decreased $535,000 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. Year to date cost of goods sold decreased $469,000 for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015.

Research and development expense decreased $8,000 for the third quarter of 2016 versus 2015 and decreased $429,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease in research and development expense is associated with  non-recurring engineering revenue with costs recorded within cost of goods sold associated with the development of custom products for specific applications . The research and development expenditures were associated with continued development of several power management products, fiber optic transceivers and high voltage optocouplers. The Company will continue to invest in development of these products and other new opportunities.

Selling, general and administrative expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 totaled 25.5% and 23.3% respectively of net sales compared to 19.2% and 20.0% for the same periods in 2015. In actual dollars, selling, general and administrative expense decreased $42,000 for the third quarter and decreased $10,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.

Provision for taxes decreased $428,000 for the first nine months of 2016 resulting in a benefit being recognized compared to expense in the same period in 2015. The estimated effective tax rate was 32% for 2016 and 33% for 2015.

Net income decreased $593,000 for the third quarter of 2016 versus 2015 and decreased $855,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $11,448,000 as of August 27, 2016 compared to $12,651,000 on November 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,203,000.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to $735,000 cash used by operations, a payment of a cash dividend of $258,000, and the investment of $203,000 in equipment.

The Company expects to continue to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its liquidity needs from the sale of products and services and the collection thereof for at least the next twelve months.

Outlook 

New orders for year-to-date 2016 totaled $11,961,000 compared to $12,535,000 for 2015. Backlog totaled $17,765,000 on August 27, 2016 compared to $18,391,000 as of August 29, 2015 and $18,925,000 on November 30, 2015. The  backlog represents a mix of the company's products and technologies with 13 % in the commercial market, 44% in the military market, and 43% in the space market compared to 22% in the commercial market, 39% in the military market, and 39% in the space market on August 29, 2015.

The Company cannot assure that the results of operations for the interim period presented are indicative of total results for the entire year due to fluctuations in customer delivery schedules, or other factors over which the Company has no control.

Cautionary Statement 

This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results could differ materially.  Investors are warned that forward-looking statements involve risks and unknown factors including, but not limited to, customer cancellation or rescheduling of orders, problems affecting delivery of vendor-supplied raw materials and components, unanticipated manufacturing problems and availability of direct labor resources.

10 

The Company produces silicon phototransistors and light emitting diode die for use in certain military, standard and custom products. Fabrication efforts sometimes may not result in successful results, limiting the availability of these components. Competitors offer commercial level alternatives and our customers may purchase our competitors' products if the Company is not able to manufacture the products using these technologies to meet the customer demands. Approximately $2,030,000 of the Company's backlog is dependent on these semiconductors.

The Company disclaims any responsibility to update the forward-looking statements contained herein, except as may be required by law.
