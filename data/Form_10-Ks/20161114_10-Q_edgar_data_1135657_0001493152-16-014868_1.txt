For
additional information regarding known material factors that could affect our operating results and performance, please read (1)
 Risk Factors  in Part II Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, as well as  Part I Item 1A Risk Factors

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Part I Item 2 of this Form 10-Q, as well as in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Should one or more of these known material risks occur, or should
the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance, achievements or plans could differ materially from
those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement.  

We
believe that it is important to communicate our expectations of future performance to our investors. However, events may occur
in the future that we are unable to accurately predict, or over which we have no control. When considering our forward-looking
statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this Form 10-Q, which provide examples of risks, uncertainties
and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.  

All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section and any other cautionary statements that
may accompany such forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update
any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances
after the date of this Form 10-Q.  

You
should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the
particular statement.

Note
1   Organization and Nature of Business  

Eco-Stim
Energy Solutions, Inc. (the  Company,   we  or  us ) is a technology-driven independent oilfield
services company providing well stimulation, coiled tubing and field management services to the upstream oil and gas industry.
We are focused on reducing the ecological impact and improving the economic performance of the well stimulation process. We have
assembled technologies and processes that have the ability to (1) reduce the surface footprint, (2) reduce emissions and (3) conserve
fuel and water during the stimulation process. The Company will focus on the most active shale resource basins outside of the
United States, using our technology to differentiate our service offerings. Our management team has extensive international industry
experience. Our first operation is in Argentina, home to the Vaca Muerta, the world s third-largest shale resource basin
as measured by technically recoverable reserves. We also intend to pursue other markets including Mexico, Colombia and the United
States or any other location where we believe we can offer clear advantages and achieve strong returns. The Company may also explore
opportunistic acquisitions and/or joint ventures with established companies in target markets.  

Note
2   Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The December 31, 2015 consolidated
balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. However,
the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the Company s
opinion, all the adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for fair presentation have been
included. The results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or for any future period. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended
December 31, 2015, a copy of which was filed with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.  

Principles
of Consolidation  

We
consolidate all wholly-owned subsidiaries, controlled joint ventures and variable interest entities where the Company has determined
it is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in, but are not limited
to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives
used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and stock-based compensation. The accounting estimates used in the preparation
of the consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information
is obtained and as the Company s operating environment changes.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company maintains deposits in several financial institutions, which may at times exceed amounts covered by insurance provided
by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Company has not experienced any losses related to
amounts in excess of FDIC limits.  

Revenue
Recognition  

The
Company s revenue is heavily dependent on three major customers All revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured as follows:  

Well
Stimulation Revenue  

The
Company provides well stimulation services based on contractual arrangements, such as term contracts and pricing agreements, or
on a spot market basis. Revenue will be recognized and customers will be invoiced upon the completion of each job, which can consist
of one or more stimulation stages.  

Under
term pricing agreement arrangements, customers commit to targeted utilization levels at agreed-upon pricing, but without termination
penalties or obligations to pay for services not used by the customer. In addition, the agreed-upon pricing is typically subject
to periodic review.  

Spot
market basis arrangements are based on an agreed-upon hourly spot market rate. The Company also charges fees for setup and mobilization
of equipment depending on the job, additional equipment used on the job, if any, and materials that are consumed during the well
stimulation process. Generally, these fees and other charges vary depending on the equipment and personnel required for the job
and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed.  

The
Company also generates revenues from chemicals and proppants that are consumed while performing well stimulation services.  

Coiled
Tubing Revenue  

The
Company began providing coiled tubing and other well stimulation services in early 2015. Jobs for these services are typically
short term in nature, lasting anywhere from a few hours to multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon completion of each day s
work based upon a completed field ticket. The Company charges the customer for mobilization, services performed, personnel on
the job, equipment used on the job, and miscellaneous consumables at agreed-upon spot market rates.  

Field
Management Revenue  

The
Company enters into arrangements to provide field management services. Field management revenue relates primarily to geophysical
predictions and production monitoring, utilizing down-hole diagnostics tools. Revenue is recognized and customers are invoiced
upon the completion of each job. The service invoices are for a set amount, which includes charges for the mobilization of the
equipment to the location, the service performed, the personnel on the job, additional equipment used on the job, consumables
used throughout the course of the service, and processing and interpretation of data acquired via down-hole diagnostic tools.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments  

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable,
accrued expenses, capital lease obligations and notes payable. The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
other assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature. The carrying
value of capital lease obligations and notes payable approximate their fair value, and the interest rates approximate market rates.  

Functional
and Presentation Currency  

Items
included in the financial statements of each of the Company s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the  functional currency ). The functional currency for the Norwegian and
Argentine subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, which is the Company s
presentation currency.  

Marketable
Securities  

Investments
in marketable securities are classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Our marketable equity investments
are classified as trading and their cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Realized and unrealized gains
and losses on trading securities are included in net loss.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased and sold Argentine bonds to capitalize its subsidiary in Argentina.
This resulted in a gain on the sale of trading securities of $2,415,607 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase
was primarily due to the Company taking advantage of the favorable spread in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Argentine
Peso. No trading securities transactions occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Net
Loss per Common Share  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average shares outstanding excluded certain stock options and
potential shares from convertible debt of 4,472,632 and 4,133,131, respectively, from the calculation of diluted earnings per
share because these shares would be anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive warrants of 100,000 for each of the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were also excluded from the calculation.  

Reclassifications  

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation.  

Accounts
Receivable  

Accounts
receivable are stated at amounts management expects to collect from outstanding balances both billed and unbilled (unbilled accounts
receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients). Management provides
for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment
of the current status of individual accounts. To date, the Company has not recognized any losses due to uncollectible accounts.
Balances still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company evaluated all accounts receivable and determined that no reserve for
doubtful accounts was necessary at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2015, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts
of $72,600.  

Included
in the Accounts Receivable balance are certain unbilled receivables with a significant customer that relate to work performed
before the Company entered into its rotational on-call contract in March 2016. Under this prior arrangement, the Company was required
to go through an arduous process to collect the outstanding amounts and while the Company has a track record of collecting amounts
billed under this prior arrangement, it has proven to take a long period of time. At September 30, 2016, there were approximately
$1,300,000 in outstanding unbilled amounts due under this prior arrangement. Further, amounts billed to this significant customer
under the rotational on-call contracts signed earlier this year have been collected within a more normal timeframe.  

Prepaids  

Prepaid
expenses are primarily comprised of Argentinian value added tax and prepaid insurance. The prepaid value added tax will be reduced
as the Company continues to invoice customers in Argentina.  

Inventory  

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value) using the average method and appropriate consideration is given
to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors in evaluating net realizable value.  

Property,
Plant and Equipment  

Property,
Plant and Equipment ( PPE ) is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditures
that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.  

Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes. Expenditures
for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs
are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets sold or abandoned and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the respective period.  

The
estimated useful lives of our major classes of PPE are as follows:  

Major
    Classes of PPE  
         
      Estimated
    Useful Lives

      Furniture
    and office equipment  
         
      3-5
    years   

Leases  

The
Company leases certain equipment under lease agreements. The Company evaluates each lease to determine its appropriate classification
as an operating or capital lease for financial reporting purposes. Any lease that does not meet the criteria for a capital lease
is accounted for as an operating lease. The assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the present
value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets. Assets under capital leases are amortized
using the straight-line method over the lease term. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense.  

Stock-Based
Compensation  

The
Company accounts for its stock options, warrants, and restricted stock grants under the fair value recognition provisions of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718. The
Company currently uses the straight-line amortization method for recognizing stock option and restricted stock compensation costs.
The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees, directors or
outside service providers are based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant dates. The grant date fair value is
estimated using either an option-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price, if
such a price exists. Such cost is recognized over the period during which an employee, director or outside service provider is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, i.e.,  the requisite service period  (which is usually the
vesting period). The Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be earned, rather than accounting for
forfeitures as they occur.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets  

The
Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. ASC Topic 360 requires the Company to review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review includes
a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets with their associated carrying value.
If the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges),
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If estimated future cash flows
are not achieved with respect to long-lived assets, additional write-downs may be required. The Company evaluated its long-lived
assets for impairment at September 30, 2016 and has determined no impairment is necessary.  

Major
Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk   

The
majority of the Company s business is conducted with major and independent oil and gas companies in Argentina. The Company
evaluates the financial strength of its customers and provides allowances for probable credit losses when deemed necessary. The
Company derives a large amount of revenue from a small number of major and independent oil and gas companies.  

We
derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of major clients. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015 three major customers accounted for approximately 83.63% and 71.25% of our services revenue, respectively.
Our accounts receivable, at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were concentrated, with major customers representing 82.94%
and 90.50% respectively.  

Income
Taxes    

Deferred
income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of
a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations of the period that includes
the enactment date. In addition, a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset for which it is determined
that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

The
Company is subject to U.S. federal and foreign income taxes along with state income taxes in Texas. When tax returns are filed,
it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are
subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence,
management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution
of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions
that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50%
likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax
positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the
taxing authorities upon examination.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which amends the current
presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for public business
entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption
is permitted. We adopted ASU 2015-03 during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 resulting in reclassification of short-term debt
issuance cost of $185,362 and $185,362 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively; and long-term debt issuance
cost of $123,575 and $262,597 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU simplifies several
aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax
withholding requirements and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under this ASU, all excess tax benefits or deficiencies
are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and the pool of windfall tax benefits as a component of
additional paid-in capital is eliminated. In regards to forfeitures, companies may make a one-time policy election to use forfeitures
applies only to instruments with service conditions; the requirement to estimate the probability of achieving performance conditions
remains. For statutory tax withholding requirements, this ASU allows for net settlement up to the employer s maximum statutory
tax withholding requirement. Formerly, only the minimum statutory tax withholding requirement was allowed to be met through net
settlement while retaining equity classification. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period for which financial statements
have not yet been issued. The application of this ASU in regards to the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory
tax withholding requirements should be applied using a modified retrospective application with a cumulative effect adjustment
to additional paid-in capital as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement
of cash flows should be applied retrospectively.

3   Accounts Receivable   

The
following table shows accounts receivable balances representing work completed, both invoiced and un-invoiced at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.  

Note
4   Stock-Based Compensation  

The
Company has two stock incentive plans, the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2013 Plan ) and the 2015 Stock Incentive
Plan (the  2015 Plan ), for the granting of stock-based incentive awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified
stock options and restricted stock, to employees, consultants and members of the Company s board of directors (the  Board ).
The 2013 Plan was adopted in 2012 and amended in 2013 and authorizes 1,000,000 shares to be issued under the 2013 Plan. The 2015
Plan, f/k/a  the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan,  was adopted in 2014; in 2015 it was amended and 500,000 additional shares
were authorized, resulting in a maximum of 1,000,000 shares being authorized for issue under the modified 2015 Plan. The 2015
Plan was further amended in 2016 to authorize an additional 200,000 shares. Both the 2013 Plan and the 2015 Plan, as amended,
have been approved by the shareholders of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, 18,328 shares were available for grant under
the 2013 Plan and 741,000 shares were available for grant under the 2015 Plan.  

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are
expected to be outstanding. The Company determined the initial expected life based on a simplified method in accordance with the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules, and pre-vesting
and post-vesting forfeitures.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $566,821 and $1,229,073, respectively, of stock-based
compensation, which is included in cost of services, selling, general and administrative expense, and research and development
in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Total unamortized stock-based compensation expense at September
30, 2016 was $1,063,659 and will be fully expensed through 2019.

Capital
Lease Obligations  

In
the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company purchased and upgraded equipment from non-related third parties, investing approximately
$3.5 million. In December 2013, the Company sold the equipment to a related party leasing company, Impact Engineering, AS. Simultaneously,
the equipment package was leased back to Eco-Stim Energy Solutions Argentina SA ( EcoStim Argentina ), a subsidiary
of the Company, as a capital lease for a 60-month period with payments beginning in February of 2014. The Company agreed to prepay
one year of payments in the amount of approximately $1.0 million and maintain a balance of no less than six months of prepayments
until the final six months of the lease. These prepayments were made prior to December 31, 2013. Further rent payments are $81,439
per month and commenced on February 1, 2014. The final six months prepaid is shown as other non-current assets in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets with a balance of $488,633.  

The
minimum present value of the lease payments is $3.1 million with a 60-month term and implied interest of 14%. The next four years
of lease payments are scheduled as follows:

6   Debt  

On
May 28, 2014 (the  Closing Date ), the Company entered into a Convertible Note Facility Agreement (the  Note
Agreement ) with ACM Emerging Markets Master Fund I, L.P. ( ACM ). The proceeds from the Note Agreement have
been used primarily for capital expenditures, certain working capital needs and approved operating budget expenses.  

The
Note Agreement allowed the Company to issue ACM a multiple draw secured promissory note with a maximum aggregate principal amount
of $22 million, convertible into the common stock of the Company (the  Common Stock ) at a price of $6.00 per share
at the option of ACM. The outstanding debt under the facility is convertible immediately and accrues interest at 14% per annum
with interest payments due annually in arrears. The debt can be prepaid in full under certain conditions after the first anniversary
of the Closing Date and matures on the date that is four years following the Closing Date.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has drawn down the full $22 million available under the Note Agreement, which was primarily
used for capital expenditures, certain working capital needs and approved operating budget expenses. The balance for accrued interest
at September 30, 2016 was $1,063,232.  

On
May 28, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment with ACM. ACM and the Company agreed to give ACM the ability to have the $2,485,162
interest payment, which was due on May 28, 2015 (the  Deferred Interest ), paid in the form of shares of the Company s
common stock upon the consummation of a future equity offering, should one occur. On July 15, 2015, the Company issued 523,192
shares of unregistered common stock at a price of $4.75 per share to ACM as payment for the Deferred Interest.

guarantees and pledges of the capital stock of the subsidiary guarantors subject to certain terms and exceptions. From time to
time, management has obtained amendments and waivers to the agreement to accommodate and adapt to the changing business environment.
Management believes that the Company will be in compliance with the amended covenants, but there can be no assurance that the
Company will achieve such compliance. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not
cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us. The Company was in compliance with all covenants or had obtained
any necessary waiver as of September 30, 2016.  

On
October 10, 2014, the Company entered into an equipment purchase agreement for the turbine pump units equipment and related spare
parts for a total purchase price of approximately $6,500,000, of which $4,100,000 was financed. The total amount financed, including
any accrued interest, was to become due and payable on April 1, 2015. On March 12, 2015, the Company amended the agreement to
add a blender, two data vans and a manifold at an increased cost of $400,000, and amended the due date of the final payment to
March 31, 2016. The amended agreement provides for monthly installment payments of $50,000 beginning in May 2015. On February
11, 2016 the Company further amended the agreement, which provided for a reduction in the principal amount of $2,000,000 and monthly

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, together
with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. Unless the context otherwise requires,  we,   us,  the  Company  or like terms refer
to Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries.   

This
section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from
those discussed in any forward-looking statement because of various factors, including those described in the section titled  Cautionary
Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in this Form 10-Q.   

Overview  

We
are a technology-driven independent oilfield services company providing well stimulation, coiled tubing and field management services
to the upstream oil and gas industry. We are focused on reducing the ecological impact and improving the economic performance
of the well stimulation process. We have assembled proven technologies and processes that have the ability to (1) reduce the surface
footprint, (2) reduce emissions and (3) conserve fuel and water during the stimulation process. We will focus on bringing these
technologies and processes to the most active shale resource basins outside of the United States, using our technology to differentiate
our service offerings. Our management team has extensive international industry experience. Our first operation is in Argentina,
home to the Vaca Muerta basin, the world s third-largest shale resource basin as measured by technically recoverable reserves.
We also intend to pursue other markets that meet our investment criteria, which may include Mexico, Colombia and the United States
as well as other markets and where we believe we can offer clear strategic advantages and achieve acceptable financial returns.
We may also explore opportunistic acquisitions and/or joint ventures with established companies in target markets.  

Our
management team has extensive experience in operating well stimulation fleets, coiled tubing units and other downhole completion
equipment, as well as providing  sweet spot  analysis in shale resource basins using geophysical predictive modeling.
We expect to leverage our management s experience and historical local relationships in undersupplied markets to pursue
profitable long-term contracts. We expect to compete for business with a limited number of other service companies based on technical
capability, quality of equipment, local experience and existing relationships rather than solely on price. We also believe that
we benefit from our association with our largest investors, which give us strategic advantages in emerging markets such as Argentina.  

Results
of Operations  

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $2,263,394 to $2,117,977 from $4,381,371 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was related to many factors including, but not limited to; (1) uncertainty surrounding the energy
policies of the newly elected president of Argentina; (2) the depressed international oil prices which reduced global capital
expenditures for oil and gas companies; (3) the departure of the CEO of our largest customer; and (4) an oversupply of equipment
which reduced pricing for our services.  

Cost
of services decreased $1,456,247 to $3,058,554 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4,514,801 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity levels during the third quarter of 2016 compared
to the third quarter of 2015 and certain cost reduction efforts.  

Our
selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $290,015 to $1,459,865 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $1,749,880 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was mainly as a result of cost reduction efforts to
match the Company s lower activity levels. These reductions included lower professional and consulting fees of $31,364,
lower travel, labor and benefits costs of $307,912, and lower administrative office costs and marketing expenses of $12,713. This
decrease was partially offset by an increase in insurance costs of $12,926 and higher bad debt expenses of $49,048.  

Research
and development for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $140,189 to $129,013 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $269,202 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development includes the cost associated
with research activities of our fiber optics technology and latest generation turbine-powered pressure pumping technology. The
research efforts around the initial reconfiguration of the turbine powered pressure pumping units was substantially completed
during the second quarter.  

Net
other expense increased $1,325,387 to $965,263 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net gain of $360,124
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of trading securities
which was $1,542,687 for the third quarter of 2015, in addition to an increase in foreign currency of $9,110. These increases
were offset by higher interest income of $114,219 and lower interest and other expenses of $112,191.  

For
the nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $4,969,022 to $6,289,461 from $11,258,483 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was related to many factors including, but not limited to; (1) uncertainty surrounding the energy
policies of the newly elected president of Argentina; (2) the depressed international oil prices which reduced global capital
expenditures for oil and gas companies; (3) the departure of the CEO of our largest customer; and (4) an oversupply of equipment
which reduced pricing for our services. This decrease was offset by a slight increase in our field management services.  

Cost
of services decreased $3,748,964 to $7,764,719 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11,513,683 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity levels during the nine months ended September
2016 compared to the nine months ended September 2015.  

Our
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $646,890 to $4,612,937 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $5,259,827. This decrease was mainly as a result of cost reduction efforts including lower professional, consulting, and travel
expenses of $342,568; lower labor and benefits cost of $26,873, lower stock compensation of $435,627, and a reduction in marketing
expenses of $60,042. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in rent and administrative office costs of $132,789,
higher bad debt expenses of $49,048 and insurance costs of $36,383.  

Research
and development for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $358,736 to $403,828 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $762,564 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development includes the cost associated
with research activities of fiber optics technology and latest generation turbine-powered pressure pumping technology. The research
efforts around the initial reconfiguration of the turbine powered pressure pumping units was substantially completed during the
third quarter.  

Net
other expense increased $2,199,065 to $3,269,624 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net gain of $1,070,559
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of trading securities
which was $2,415,607, higher interest and foreign currency expenses of $580,381. These increases were offset by interest income
of $744,786 and other expenses of $52,137.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources  

Our
primary sources of liquidity to date have been proceeds from various equity and debt offerings. We completed a public offering
during the first quarter of 2015 and a second offering during the third quarter of 2015 as discussed in in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 Part II   Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplemental Data  
Notes to the consolidated financial statements   Note 11    Equity Offering.  Our immediate liquidity
is threatened by our reduced cash flow from operations, and we are currently seeking to raise additional capital through debt
or equity financing to address our liquidity issues. Please see the risk factors included under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the risk factor included under Part II, Item IA, Risk
Factors, in our previous Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  

The successful execution
of our growth strategy depends on our ability to raise capital as needed to, among other things, finance the purchase of additional
equipment. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to sustain or increase
our current level of growth in the future. The availability of equity and debt financing will be affected by prevailing economic
conditions in our industry and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

Capital
Requirements  

The
energy services business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to expand, upgrade and maintain equipment. Our
primary uses of capital have been the acquisition of equipment, working capital to finance the start of our operations and general
administrative expenses.  

Going
forward, we expect our capital requirements to consist primarily of:  

growth
    capital expenditures, such as those to acquire additional equipment and other assets to grow our business;   

maintenance
    capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to extend the useful life of our assets; and.   

working
    capital.   

service
    of debt obligations.   

Additionally,
we continually monitor new advances in well stimulation equipment and down-hole technology as well as technologies that may complement
our business and opportunities to acquire additional equipment to meet our customers  needs. Our ability to make any significant
acquisition for cash would likely require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us on
favorable terms or at all.  

Our
ability to fund operations, and to fund planned and committed 2016 capital expenditures will depend upon our future operating
performance, and more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing, which will be affected by prevailing economic
conditions, market conditions in the exploration and production industry and financial, business and other factors, many of which
are beyond our control.  

Sources
and Uses of Cash  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $5,032,144 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12,813,677 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity and pricing levels during the nine months
ended September 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 2015.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was $3,942,516 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,595,227 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is primary related to the absence of the gain on sale of trading securities of
$3,776,374 and a decrease in purchases of equipment of $3,429,085.  

Net
cash used in financing activities was $1,144,819 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $30,660,118 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the sale of common stock of $30,751,388 during 2015. The
following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively:  

On
December 15, 2015, the board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase, from time to time up to $5 million in shares of
its outstanding common stock, from December 16, 2015 through December 16, 2017. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had purchased
21,850 shares at a cost of $57,469 under this program.  

On
July 13, 2016, the Company entered into an At-Market Issuance Sales Agreement as disclosed in Note 7    Equity .
During the third quarter ended September 2016, the Company sold 707,746 shares through the Agreement, for total net proceeds of
$1,488,534.  

We
had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $10,119,479, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net
increase in cash and cash equivalents of $14,251,214 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily resulting from our
operating activities and capital expenditures.  

We
do not generate positive cash flow at this time. Further, while we believe we will begin generating positive cash flow from operations
in the first half of 2017, our liquidity provided by our existing cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to fund our
full capital expenditure plan and working capital needs. Our current capital commitments will require us to obtain additional
equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.  

Impact
of Inflation on Operations  

Management
is of the opinion that inflation has not had a significant impact on our business to date. We purchase our equipment and materials
from suppliers who provide competitive prices, and employ skilled workers from competitive labor markets. If inflation in the
general economy increases, our costs for equipment, materials and labor could increase as well. Also, increases in activity in
oilfields can cause upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which we hire employees as well as increases in the costs
of certain materials and key equipment components used to provide services to our customers.  

Industry
Trends and Outlook  

We
face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. Although many factors contributing to these risks are beyond
our ability to control, we continuously monitor these risks and have taken steps to mitigate them to the extent practicable. In
addition, while we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, we may not be able to
achieve our business objectives and, consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Please read this section
in conjunction with the factors described in the sections titled  Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
and  Risk Factors  for additional information about the known material risks that we face.  

Our
business depends on the capital spending programs of our customers. Revenue from our stimulation and field management segments
are expected to be generated by providing services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies throughout Argentina,
Colombia, Mexico and other countries. Demand for our services is a function of our customers  willingness to make operating
and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in these areas, which in turn is affected by current
and expected levels of oil and natural gas prices. Companies in the energy services industry have historically tended to delay
capital equipment projects, including maintenance and upgrades, during industry downturns.  

The
oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile, is highly sensitive to a combination of long-term and cyclical trends, including
the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural
gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash
flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling and workover budget, as well as domestic
and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries and merger, acquisition and divestiture
activity among exploration and production companies. The volatility of the oil and gas industry, and the consequent impact on
exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by our customers. This
volatility affects the demand for our services and our ability to negotiate pricing at levels generating desirable margins, especially
in our stimulation business.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements  

As
of September 30, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement 
generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party,
under which we have (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or (ii)
a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity
or market risk support for such assets.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Evaluation

and other procedures designed to give reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file
