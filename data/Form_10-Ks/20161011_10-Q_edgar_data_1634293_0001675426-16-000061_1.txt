    NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

   AS
OF August 31, 2016   

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE
1 - ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION      

Exceed World,
Inc., formerly known as Brilliant Acquisition, Inc. (the  Company ), a growth company, was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. On February
29, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) with Tomoo Yoshida,
our President, CEO and Director. Pursuant to this Agreement, on February 29, 2016, Tomoo Yoshida transferred to the Company, 10
shares of the common stock of E F Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation ( E F ), which represents all of its issued
and outstanding shares, in consideration of 500,000 JPY ($4,835). Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction
described above on February 29, 2016, Exceed World, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of E F s
common stock and E F became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On August 4, 2016, E F changed its name to School
TV Co., Ltd. ( School TV ). As of August 31, 2016, the Company conducts a business of selling and distributing of health
related   products   through School TV.  

On August 1, 2016, the Company changed its
fiscal year end from November 30 to September 30. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements of Exceed World, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of the management of the Company,
all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the three month period,
have been made. Results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected
for the entire fiscal year. When used in these notes, the terms  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our 
mean the Company. Certain information and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America has been omitted from these statements pursuant to such
accounting principles and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial
statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2015. 

NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiary, School
TV. 

INVENTORIES  

Inventories, consisting of products available
for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method, and are valued at the lower of cost
or market value. This valuation requires E F to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely
method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected
recoverable values of each disposition category. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  

Transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into
the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are
recorded in the statements of operations. 

The reporting currency of the Company
is the United States Dollars ( US$ ) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. The Company
maintains its books and record in its local currency, Japanese YEN ( JPY ), which is a functional currency as being
the primary currency of the economic environment in which its operation is conducted. In accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,  Translation
of Financial Statement , assets and liabilities of the Company whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$,
using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the
period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements are recorded as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income within the statements of stockholders  equity. 

Translation of amounts from the local
currency of the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates: 

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS  

ASC Topic 220,  Comprehensive
Income , establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss, its components and
accumulated balances. Comprehensive income or loss as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from
non-affiliate sources. Accumulated comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders 
equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation.  

REVENUE RECOGNITION  

The Company  recognizes revenue when it is realized or
realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that contemplates realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is considered a start-up company and has reoccurring
losses and negative cash flows. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as
a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue- producing contracts or financing or if the revenue
or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate
its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute
the interests of existing stockholders. 

NOTE 4 - RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

On January 12, 2016, Mr. DeNunzio, the former
sole shareholder of the Company, consummated a sale of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd.,
for an aggregate purchase price of $34,900. Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, e-Learning Laboratory Co.,
Ltd., owns a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Commensurate with the closing, the Company, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate
of Amendment to change the name of Registrant to Exceed World, Inc. 

School TV Co. Ltd. has paid certain consulting fees for e-Learning Laboratory Co. Ltd. For the nine months
ended August 31, 2016, total amount paid was $43,348, among which $23,271 was repaid to the Company from e-Learning Laboratory
Co. Ltd. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has a due from related party in the amount of $20,077. 

On February 29, 2016, the Company entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Tomoo Yoshida, our President, CEO and Director. Pursuant to this Agreement, on February 29,
2016 Tomoo Yoshida transferred to Exceed World, Inc., 10 shares of the common stock of E F Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation
( E F ), which represents all of its issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of $4,835. This is a merger
of entities under common control and therefore  all assets,
liabilities and operations of E F were accounted for at their historical carryover basis and as if they had been combined
since E F s inception. Further note the inception date of E F and that from inception through the date of acquisition
that E F had no revenues and nominal assets. The date of incorporation of E F (now known as School TV Co. Ltd.) is
January 18, 2016.  

The assets and liabilities of E F at February
29, 2016 are as follows: 

*As of February 29, 2016, 1 US Dollar was 112.17
to JP Yen for the historical rate and 118.27 for the average rate. 

 * On August 4, 2016, E F changed its name
to School TV Co., Ltd. ( School TV ) 

Following the effective date of the share
purchase transaction described above on February 29, 2016, Exceed World, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the issued and
outstanding shares of E F s common stock and E F became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exceed World, Inc. 

On February 29, 2016, the Company wrote off
the accrued expenses owed to the previous owner in the amount of $4,696. The accrued expense written off has been recorded as an
adjustment of additional paid in capital. 

As of August 31, 2016, the Company had $173,178
owed to Tomoo Yoshida, its sole director, for payment of the Company s expenses of which $4,835 was paid for
the acquisition of School TV s common stock. These are due on demand and bear no interest. 

As
of August 31, 2016, the Company had $20,077 owed to e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd. for payment of the Company s expenses.

including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the
assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private

Company Overview  

Corporate History  

The Company was originally incorporated with the name Brilliant
Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an
operating business. 

On January 12, 2016, Thomas DeNunzio of 780 Reservoir Avenue,
#123, Cranston, RI 02910, the sole shareholder of the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement )
with e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd. ( e-Learning ), with an address at 1-23-38-6F, Esakacho, Suita-shi, Osaka 564-0063
Japan. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. DeNunzio transferred to e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd., 20,000,000 shares of our common
stock which represents all of our issued and outstanding shares. 

Following the closing of the share purchase transaction,
e-Learning gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and became the controlling shareholder
of the Company. 

On January 12, 2016, the Company changed its name to Exceed
World, Inc. and filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment. 

On January 12, 2016, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio resigned as our
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. The resignation was not the result
of any disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices. 

On January 12, 2016, Mr. Tomoo Yoshida was appointed as our
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 

On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement with Tomoo Yoshida, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
Pursuant to this Agreement, Tomoo Yoshida transferred to Exceed World, Inc., 10 shares of the common stock of E F, which represents
all of its issued and outstanding shares in consideration of $4,835. Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction
on February 29, 2016, Exceed World, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of E F s common
stock and E F became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exceed World.    On August

Business Information
of School TV   

The Company is a start-up stage company and concentrates
on the selling and distribution of health related products to customers in Japan through School TV which is our wholly owned subsidiary.  

Our principal executive offices are located at 1-2-38-8F,
Esaka-cho, Suita-shi, Osaka 564-0063, Japan. Our phone number is +81-6-6339-4117. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

Our cash balance is $12,838 as of August 31, 2016. Our cash
balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize
funds from Tomoo Yoshida, our sole Director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for filing fees, and
professional fees. Tomoo Yoshida, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to
the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require further funding. Being a
start-up stage company, we have very limited operating history. After a twelve-month period we may need additional financing but
currently do not have any arrangements for such financing. 

As of August 31, 2016, the company have a related-party payable
in the amount of $173,178 to Tomoo Yoshida, our sole officer and director. 

If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either
have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations entirely. 

Inventory   

As of August, 2016, we have $96,453 in inventory which is
made up of various health related products that we intend to utilize for display purposes and resale. Any purchase of goods from
our direct supply of inventory will be sent out to the purchaser and we will be responsible for any shipping or related costs. 

Net Loss   

We recorded a net loss of $16,985 for the nine months ended
August 31 as opposed to $4,550 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. The increase in net loss is attributed to increase in
operating expenses. 

Going Concern   

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that contemplates realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is considered a start-up company and has reoccurring
losses and negative cash flows. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.  The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as
a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue- producing contracts or financing or if the revenue
or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate
its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute
the interests of existing stockholders.

ITEM 4   
         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
our chief financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting
officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of August 31, 2016, the end of the fiscal period covered
by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, with the participation of our
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due
to material weaknesses identified below. 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness
of controls    

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations
which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or
changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible
to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting that have occurred during our fiscal year end November 30, 2015 and for the interim period ending August 31, 2016, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    

On January 12, 2016, Mr. DeNunzio, the former sole shareholder
of the Company, consummated a sale of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd. 

 Following the closing of the share purchase transaction,
e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd., gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. E-Learning Laboratory

USD. 

The aforementioned sale of shares was exempt from registration
in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Regulation S ) because the above sales of
the stock were made to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions,
and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates,
