(1) Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by Stoneridge, Inc. (the  Company ) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The information furnished in the condensed consolidated financial statements
includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair
presentation of such financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the SEC's
rules and regulations. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

While the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to
make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's 2015 Form 10-K.  

(2)  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted    

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230)  which provides guidance on the presentation and classification of
certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows in order to reduce diversity in practice.  The ASU
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  which is intended to simplify several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including how excess tax benefits should be classified in the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements.  The new standard also permits companies to recognize forfeitures as they occur
as an alternative to utilizing estimated forfeitures rates which has been the required practice.  The new accounting standard
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year.  The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016   02,  Leases
(Topic 842)  which will require that a lessee recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a
lease term of more than twelve months, with the result being the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability. 
The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that year.  The
Company expects to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements, which will require right of use assets and lease liabilities
be recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet for operating leases.   

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015   17,  Income
Taxes (Topic 740)  which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes.  Currently entities are required to separate
deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the balance sheet.  ASU 2015-17 requires
that all deferred income taxes be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within those fiscal years and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively
with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11  Simplifying the
Measurement of Inventory  which requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Prior
to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market. Replacing the concept of market with
the single measurement of net realizable value is intended to reduce cost and complexity. The new accounting standard is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company expects to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017, which
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  (in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated)

(Unaudited)  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers  which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede existing revenue recognition
guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods
or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity identifies the contract with a customer, identifies the separate
performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations and recognizes revenue when each separate performance obligation is satisfied. This ASU allows for both retrospective
and prospective methods of adoption.  In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard.
Therefore, the new standard will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption
on the original effective date permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

(3) Discontinued Operations  

Wiring Business   

On August 1, 2014, the Company completed the sale of substantially
all of the assets and liabilities of its Wiring business to Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd., an India-based manufacturer of diversified
products for the global automotive industry, and MSSL (GB) LIMITED (collectively,  Motherson ), for $71,386 in cash
that consisted of the stated purchase price and estimated working capital on the closing date. The final purchase price was subject
to post-closing working capital and other adjustments. Upon the final resolution of the working capital and other adjustments in
the second quarter of 2015, the Company returned $1,230 in cash to Motherson. 

The Company also entered into short-term transition services agreements
with Motherson substantially all of which concluded in the second quarter of 2015 associated with information systems, accounting,
administrative, occupancy and support services as well as contract manufacturing and production support in Estonia. 

The Company had post-disposition sales to the Wiring business acquired
by Motherson for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $4,627 and $15,378, respectively, and $7,299 and $21,574
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company had post-disposition purchases from the Wiring
business acquired by Motherson of $121 and $315 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $242
and $583 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

There was no activity related to discontinued operations for the
Wiring business in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The following table displays summarized activity in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations for discontinued operations related to the Wiring business: 

(A)  The loss on disposal for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included transaction costs of $94 and $192, respectively.
The loss on disposal also included a working capital and other adjustments of $24 and $38 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively.

(4) Inventories  

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (using either the first-in,
first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost methods) or market. The Company evaluates and adjusts as necessary its excess and
obsolescence reserve on a quarterly basis. Excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales or usage for
a reasonable period. The Company has guidelines for calculating provisions for excess inventories based on the number of months
of inventories on hand compared to anticipated sales or usage. Management uses its judgment to forecast sales or usage and to determine
what constitutes a reasonable period. Inventory cost includes material, labor and overhead. Inventories consisted of the following: 

Inventory valued using the FIFO method was $41,452 and $35,378 at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Inventory valued using the average cost method was $23,748 and $25,631
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

(5) Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  

Financial Instruments  

A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an obligation
to deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or another financial instrument. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments.  

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  

On September 30, 2016, the Company had open foreign currency forward
contracts which are used solely for hedging and not for speculative purposes. Management believes that its use of these instruments
to reduce risk is in the Company's best interest.  The counterparties to these financial instruments are financial institutions
with investment grade credit ratings. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk   

The Company conducts business internationally and therefore is exposed
to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as cash flow and fair value hedges to
manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency
denominated intercompany transactions, inventory purchases and other foreign currency exposures. The currencies hedged by the Company
during 2016 and 2015 included the euro and Mexican peso. In addition, the Company hedged the U.S. dollar against the Swedish krona
and euro on behalf of its European subsidiaries in 2016 and 2015. 

These forward contracts were executed to hedge forecasted transactions
and have been accounted for as cash flow hedges. As such, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss was deferred and
reported in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The
cash flow hedges were highly effective. The effectiveness of the transactions has been and will be measured on an ongoing basis
using regression analysis and forecasted future purchases of the currency.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  (in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated)

(Unaudited)  

In certain instances, the foreign currency forward contracts do
not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges, and therefore are marked-to-market with gains and losses recognized
in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations as a component of other income, net. 

The Company's foreign currency forward contracts offset a portion
of the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions as follows: 

Euro-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contract  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held a
foreign currency forward contract with underlying notional amounts of $1,711 and $1,647, respectively, to reduce the exposure related
to the Company's euro-denominated intercompany loans. This contract expires in December 2016. The euro-denominated foreign
currency forward contract was not designated as a hedging instrument. The Company recognized a gain of $1 and a loss of $9 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component
of other income, net related to the euro-denominated contract. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recognized a loss of $38 and a gain of $307, respectively, related to this contract. 

U.S. dollar-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts  
Cash Flow Hedges  

The Company entered into on behalf of one of its European Electronics
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Swedish krona, U.S. dollar-denominated currency contracts with a notional amount
at September 30, 2016 of $2,655 which expire ratably on a monthly basis from October 2016 through December 2016, compared to a
notional amount of $10,007 at December 31, 2015. 

The Company entered into on behalf of one of its European Electronics
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro, U.S. dollar-denominated currency contracts with a notional amount at September
30, 2016 of $608 which expire ratably on a monthly basis from October 2016 through December 2016, compared to a notional amount
of $2,421 at December 31, 2015. 

The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the U.S. dollar-denominated
foreign currency forward contracts held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and concluded that the hedges were effective. 

Mexican peso-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts  
Cash Flow Hedge  

The Company holds Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency forward
contracts with notional amounts at September 30, 2016 of $2,417 which expire ratably on a monthly basis from October 2016 through
December 2016, compared to a notional amount of $9,780 at December 31, 2015.  

The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the Mexican peso-denominated
foreign currency forward contracts held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and concluded that the hedges were effective.

  (in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated)

(Unaudited)  

The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in
the condensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows:  

(A)    Notional amounts represent the gross contract in U.S. dollars of the derivatives outstanding.    

Amounts recorded for the cash flow hedges in other comprehensive
income (loss) and in net income for the three months ended September 30 are as follows:  

Amounts recorded for the cash flow hedges in other comprehensive
income (loss) and in net income for the nine months ended September 30 are as follows:  

Gains and losses reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)
into net income were recognized in cost of goods sold in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

The net deferred loss of $83 on the cash flow hedge derivatives
will be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to the condensed consolidated statements of operations through December
2016.   

Fair Value Measurements   

The Company s assets and liabilities are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the three levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the reliability of the
inputs used. Fair values estimated using Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Fair values estimated using Level 2 inputs, other than
quoted prices, are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly and include among other things, quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active or inactive as well as inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable. For forward currency contracts, inputs include foreign currency exchange rates. Fair values estimated using
Level 3 inputs consist of significant unobservable inputs. 

11  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  (in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated)

(Unaudited)  

The Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities fair
valued using Level 1 or Level 3 inputs at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The fair value of financial assets using Level
2 inputs related to forward currency contracts were $163 and $474 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The
fair value of financial liabilities using Level 2 inputs related to forward currency contracts were $259 and $93 at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

(6) Share-Based Compensation  

Compensation expense for share-based compensation arrangements,
which is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses, was $1,699 and $1,264 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 total share-based compensation was $4,587 compared to $5,746 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $545 related to
the modification of the retirement notice provisions of certain awards. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $2,225

(7) Debt  

Debt consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015: 

Revolving Credit Facility   

On November 2, 2007, the Company entered into an asset-based credit
facility, which permits borrowing up to a maximum level of $100,000. The Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit and
Security Agreement and a Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement on September 20, 2010 and December 1, 2011,
respectively.

On September 12, 2014, the Company
entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  Amended Agreement  or  Credit Facility ).
The Amended Agreement provides for a $300,000 revolving credit facility, which replaced the Company s existing $100,000 asset-based
credit facility and includes a letter of credit subfacility, swing line subfacility and multicurrency subfacility. The Amended
Agreement also has an accordion feature which allows the Company to increase the availability by up to $80,000 upon the satisfaction
of certain conditions.   The Amended Agreement extended the termination date to September 12,
2019 from December 1, 2016. On March 26, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended Agreement which modified
the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to allow for the add back of cash premiums and other non-cash charges related to the amendment
and restatement of the Amended Agreement and the early extinguishment of the Company s 9.5% Senior Secured Notes. Consolidated
EBITDA is used in computing the Company s leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio which are covenants within the Amended
Agreement. On February 23, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Amended Agreement which amended and waived any
default or potential defaults with respect to the pledging as collateral additional shares issued by a wholly owned subsidiary
and newly issued shares associated with the formation of a new subsidiary. On August 12, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment
No. 3 (the  Amendment ) to the Amended Agreement which extended of the expiration date of the Agreement by two years
to September 12, 2021, increased the borrowing sub-limit for the Company s foreign subsidiaries by $30,000 to $80,000, increased
the basket of permitted loans and investments in foreign subsidiaries by $5,000 to $30,000, and provided additional flexibility
to the Company for certain permitted corporate transactions involving its foreign subsidiaries as defined in the Agreement. As
a result of Amendment No. 3, the Company capitalized deferred financing costs of $339, which will be amortized over the remaining
term of the Credit Facility.  

Borrowings under the Amended Agreement bear interest at either the
Base Rate, as defined, or the LIBOR Rate, at the Company s option, plus the applicable margin as set forth in the Amended
Agreement. The Company is also subject to a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% based on the Company s leverage ratio.
The Amended Agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, and a minimum interest coverage
ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and places a maximum annual limit on capital expenditures. The Amended Agreement also contains other affirmative
and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for credit arrangements of this type including covenants which
place restrictions and/or limitations on the Company s ability to borrow money, make capital expenditures and pay dividends.
Borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility decreased from $100,000 at December 31, 2015 to $87,000 at September 30, 2016 as
a result of an unplanned partial repayment made against the Credit Facility during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company was in compliance with all Credit Facility covenants
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Debt   

PST maintains several short-term obligations and long-term notes
used for working capital purposes which have fixed annual interest rates. The weighted-average interest rates of short-term and
long-term debt of PST at September 30, 2016 were 11.1% and 13.2%, respectively.  Depending on the specific note, interest
is payable either monthly or annually. Principal repayments on PST debt at September 30, 2016 are as follows: $9,710 from October
2016 through September 2017, $963 from October 2017 through December 2017, $3,972 in 2018, $2,566 in 2019, $398 in 2020 and $365
in 2021. PST was in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary located in Stockholm, Sweden,
has an overdraft credit line which allows overdrafts on the subsidiary's bank account up to a maximum level of 20,000 Swedish krona,
or $2,333 and $2,369, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there
was no balance outstanding on this bank account. 

(8) Earnings Per Share  

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by
the weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding for each respective period. Diluted earnings per share was calculated
by dividing net income by the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive Common Shares that were outstanding during the periods
presented.

Weighted-average Common Shares outstanding used in calculating basic
and diluted earnings per share were as follows: 

Performance-based restricted Common Shares outstanding at September
30, 2016 and 2015 were 0 and 134,250, respectively. There were also 843,140 and 573,885 performance-based right to receive
Common Shares outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These performance-based restricted and right to receive
Common Shares are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share based on the number of Common Shares that would be
issuable if the end of the quarter were the end of the contingency period. 

(9) Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss by Component  

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

(10)  Commitments and Contingencies  

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject
to a broad range of claims and legal proceedings that relate to contractual allegations, product liability, tax audits, patent
infringement, employment-related matters and environmental matters. The Company establishes accruals for matters which it
believes that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimable. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
of these matters, the Company is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. 

As a result of environmental studies performed at the Company s
former facility located in Sarasota, Florida, the Company became aware of soil and groundwater contamination at the site. The
Company engaged an environmental engineering consultant to assess the level of contamination and to develop a remediation and
monitoring plan for the site. Soil remediation at the site was completed during the year ended December 31, 2010. As the remedial
action plan has been approved by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, groundwater remediation began in the fourth
quarter of 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, environmental remediation costs incurred
were immaterial. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company accrued a remaining undiscounted liability of $488 and
$532, respectively, related to future remediation costs. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $396 and $469, respectively,
was recorded as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets while
the remaining amount was recorded as a component of other long-term liabilities. A majority of the costs associated with the recorded
liability will be incurred at the start of the groundwater remediation which is expected to begin in November 2016, with the balance
relating to monitoring costs to be incurred over multiple years. The recorded liability is based on assumptions in the remedial
action plan. Although the Company sold the Sarasota facility and related property in December 2011, the liability to remediate
the site contamination remains the responsibility of the Company. Due to the ongoing site remediation, the closing terms of the
sale agreement included a requirement for the Company to maintain a $2,000 letter of credit for the benefit of the buyer.

The Company has a legal proceeding,  Verde v. Stoneridge,
Inc. et al ., currently pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Cause No. 6:14-cv-00225-
KNM.  The plaintiff filed this putative class action against the Company and others on March 26, 2014.  The plaintiff
alleges that the Company was involved in the vertical chain of manufacture, distribution, and sale of a control device ( CD )
that was incorporated into a Dodge Ram truck purchased by Plaintiff in 2006.  Plaintiff alleges that the Company breached
express warranties and indemnification provisions by supplying a defective CD that was not capable of performing its intended
function.  The putative class consists of all Texas residents who own manual transmission Chrysler vehicles model years 1997 2007
equipped with the subject CD.  Plaintiff seeks recovery of economic loss damages incurred by him and the putative class members
associated with inspecting and replacing the allegedly defective CD, as well as attorneys  fees and costs.  Plaintiff
filed a motion for class certification seeking to certify a class of Texas residents who own or lease certain automobiles sold
by Chrysler from 1997 2007.  Plaintiff alleges this putative class would include approximately 120,000 people. 
In the motion for class certification, the Plaintiff states that damages are no more than $1 per person.  A hearing on the
Plaintiff s motion for class certification was held on November 16, 2015, and the United States District Court has not yet
ruled on class certification.  On April 8, 2016, the Magistrate Judge granted the Company s motion for partial summary
judgment dismissing the Plaintiff s indemnification claim; that ruling was later adopted by the United States District Court. 

Similarly,  Royal v. Stoneridge, Inc. et al.  is another
legal proceeding currently pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, Case No. 5:14-cv-01410-F. 
Plaintiffs filed this putative class action against the Company, Stoneridge Control Devices, Inc., and others on December 19,
2014.  Plaintiffs allege that the Company was involved in the vertical chain of manufacture, distribution, and sale of a
CD that was incorporated into Dodge Ram trucks purchased by Plaintiffs between 1999 and 2006.  Plaintiffs allege that the
Company and Stoneridge Control Devices, Inc. breached various express and implied warranties, including the implied warranty of
merchantability.  Plaintiffs also seek indemnity from the Company and Stoneridge Control Devices, Inc.  The putative
class consists of all owners of vehicles equipped with the subject CD, which includes various Dodge Ram trucks and other manual
transmission vehicles manufactured from 1997 2007, which Plaintiffs allege is more than one million vehicles.  Plaintiffs
seek recovery of economic loss damages associated with inspecting and replacing the allegedly defective CD, diminished value of
the subject CDs and the trucks in which they were installed, and attorneys  fees and costs.  The amount of compensatory
or other damages sought by Plaintiffs and the putative class members is unknown. On January 12, 2016, the United States District
Court granted in part the Company s and Stoneridge Control Devices, Inc. s motions to dismiss, and dismissed four
of the Plaintiffs  five claims against the Company and Stoneridge Control Devices, Inc. Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration
of the United States District Court s ruling, which was denied. The Company is vigorously defending itself against the Plaintiffs 
allegations, and has and will continue to challenge the claims as well as class action certification. The Company believes the
likelihood of loss is not probable or reasonably estimable, and therefore no liability has been recorded for these claims at September
30, 2016. 

In September 2013, two legal proceedings were initiated by
Actia Automotive ( Actia ) in a French court (the tribunal de grande instance de Paris) alleging infringement of its
patents by the Company s Electronics segment. The euro (   ) and U.S. dollar equivalent ( $ )
that Actia was seeking has been  7,000 ($7,900) for each claim for injunctive relief and monetary damages resulting from
such alleged infringement. The Company believed that its products did not infringe on any of the patents claimed by Actia, and
the claims were without merit.  The Company vigorously defended itself against these allegations, and challenged certain
Actia patents in the European Patent Office.  In September 2015, the French court ruled in favor of the Company on one claim,
which was subject to appeal by Actia.  However, on July 28, 2016 the Company reached a settlement with Actia with regard
to both claims.  Under the settlement the Company agreed to forego a payment by Actia of  50 ($56) that had been ordered
by the French Court and Actia agreed (i) not to appeal the French court s ruling against it on the first claim and (ii)
to dismiss its infringement claims against the Company with respect to the second claim.  Under the settlement Actia agreed
not to enforce any of the patents in question against the Company, or the Company s successors and assigns.  As a result
this matter has been settled and no liability has been recorded for these claims at September 30, 2016.

On May 24, 2013, the State Revenue Services of S o Paulo
issued a tax deficiency notice against PST claiming that the vehicle tracking and monitoring services it provides should be classified
as communication services, and therefore subject to the State Value Added Tax   ICMS. The State Revenue Services assessment
imposed the 25.0% ICMS tax on all revenues of PST related to the vehicle tracking and monitoring services rendered during the
period from January 2009 through December 2010. The Brazilian real ( R$ ) and U.S. dollar equivalent ( $ )
of the aggregate tax assessment is approximately R$92,500 ($28,500) which is comprised of Value Added Tax   ICMS of R$13,200
($4,100) interest of R$11,400 ($3,500) and penalties of R$67,900 ($20,900). 

The Company believes that the vehicle tracking and monitoring
services are non-communication services, as defined under Brazilian tax law, subject to the municipal ISS tax, not communication
services subject to state ICMS tax as claimed by the State Revenue Services of S o Paulo. PST has, and will continue to
collect the municipal ISS tax on the vehicle tracking and monitoring services in compliance with Brazilian tax law and will defend
its tax position. PST has received a legal opinion that the merits of the case are favorable to PST, determining among other things
that the imposition on the subsidiary of the State ICMS by the State Revenue Services of S o Paulo is not in accordance
with the Brazilian tax code. Management believes, based on the legal opinion of the Company s Brazilian legal counsel and
the results of the Brazil Administrative Court's ruling in favor of another vehicle tracking and monitoring company related to
the tax deficiency notice it received, the likelihood of loss is not probable although it may take years to resolve.  As
a result of the above, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no accrual has been recorded with respect to the tax assessment. 
An unfavorable judgment on this issue for the years assessed and for subsequent years could result in significant costs to PST
and adversely affect its results of operations. There have been no significant changes to the facts and circumstances related
to this notice for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

In addition, PST has civil, labor and other tax contingencies
for which the likelihood of loss is deemed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, by the Company s legal advisors
in Brazil. As a result, no provision has been recorded with respect to these contingencies, which amounted to R$34,600 ($10,700)
and R$25,400 ($6,500) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. An unfavorable outcome on these contingencies
could result in significant cost to PST and adversely affect its results of operations. 

Product Warranty and Recall   

Amounts accrued for product warranty and recall claims are
established based on the Company's best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold
as of the balance sheet dates. These accruals are based on several factors including past experience, production changes,
industry developments and various other considerations including insurance coverage. The Company can provide no assurances
that it will not experience material claims or that it will not incur significant costs to defend or settle such claims beyond
the amounts accrued or beyond what the Company may recover from its suppliers. The current portion of product warranty and
recall is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Product
warranty and recall included $2,293 and $1,973 of a long-term liability at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
which is included as a component of other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The following provides a reconciliation of changes in product
warranty and recall liability:  

(11) Headquarter Relocation  

In March 2016, the Company announced the relocation of its
corporate headquarters from Warren, Ohio to Novi, Michigan which will primarily occur during the fourth quarter of 2016. As a
result, the Company incurred relocation costs of $726 and $998 for the three and nine months ended September 2016, respectively.
The relocation costs incurred included employee retention, relocation, severance, recruiting, duplicate wages and professional
fees.

In April 2016, the Company entered into a long-term lease agreement
for its new corporate headquarters. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred
under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent the Company was involved in the construction of structural improvements or
takes construction risk prior to the commencement of a lease. As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash build-to-suit
lease asset under construction of $4,322 (within Prepaid and other currents assets) and a corresponding obligation (within accrued
expenses and other current liabilities) in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Also, the Company concluded that the Warren, Ohio headquarter
building, which had a net book value of $481 at September 30, 2016 and is actively marketed for sale, met the criteria for held
for sale accounting treatment. As such, it was reclassified from Property, plant and equipment, net to Prepaid and other current
assets at September 30, 2016. 

(12) Business Realignment  

The Company regularly evaluates the performance of its businesses
and cost structures, including personnel, and makes necessary changes thereto in order to optimize its results.  The
Company also evaluates the required skill sets of its personnel and periodically makes strategic changes.  As a consequence
of these actions, the Company incurs severance related costs which are referred to as business realignment charges. 

Business realignment charges by reportable segment were as
follows: 

(A)  Severance costs
                                         for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to selling, general and administrative
                                         ( SG A ) and design and development ( D D ) were $196
                                         and $984, respectively. Severance costs for both the three and nine months ended September
                                         30, 2015 related to SG A and D D were $102 and $215, respectively.

(13) Income Taxes  

The Company computes its consolidated income tax provision
each quarter based on a projected annual effective tax rate, as required. The Company is required to reduce deferred tax assets
by a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of
the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. The Company also records the income tax impact
of certain discrete, unusual or infrequently occurring items including changes in judgment about valuation allowances and effects
of changes in tax laws or rates, in the interim period in which they occur. 

When a company maintains a valuation allowance in a particular
jurisdiction, no net income tax expense or (benefit) will typically be provided on income (loss) for that jurisdiction on an annual
basis. Jurisdictions with projected income that maintain a valuation allowance typically will form part of the projected annual
effective tax rate calculation discussed above. However, jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year that maintain a valuation
allowance are excluded from the projected annual effective income tax rate calculation. Instead, the income tax for these jurisdictions
is computed separately. 

The actual year to date income tax expense (benefit) is the
product of the most current projected annual effective income tax rate and the actual year to date pre-tax income (loss) adjusted
for any discrete tax items. The income tax expense (benefit) for a particular quarter is the difference between the year to date
calculation of income tax expense (benefit) and the year to date calculation for the prior quarter. 

Therefore, the actual effective income tax rate during a particular
quarter can vary significantly based upon the jurisdictional mix and timing of actual earnings compared to projected annual earnings,
permanent items, earnings for those jurisdictions that maintain a valuation allowance, tax associated with jurisdictions excluded
from the projected annual effective income tax rate calculation and discrete items. 

The Company recognized income tax expense of $919 and $32 from
continuing operations for federal, state and foreign income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period for 2015 was primarily
due to the increase in consolidated earnings. Also, income tax expense increased due to PST s operating loss which generated
a benefit for the third quarter of 2015, however, due to the valuation allowance position taken in the fourth quarter of 2015,
no longer provides a tax benefit in 2016. The effective tax rate increased to 8.4% in the third quarter of 2016 from 0.4% in the
third quarter of 2015 primarily due to a full valuation allowance on PST s loss that negatively impacted the effective tax
rate. The impact of PST on the effective tax rate was partially offset by the continued strong performance of the U.S. operations
which, due to a full valuation allowance, positively impacted the effective tax rate. 

The Company recognized income tax expense (benefit) of $3,114
and $(202) from continuing operations for federal, state and foreign income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.  The increase in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
same period for 2015 was primarily due to the increase in consolidated earnings. In addition, income tax expense increased due
to PST s operating loss which generated a benefit for the first nine months of 2015, however, due to the valuation allowance
position taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, no longer provides a tax benefit in 2016. The effective tax rate increased to 10.3%
in the first nine months of 2016 from (1.3)% in the first nine months of 2015 primarily due to a full valuation allowance on PST s
loss that negatively impacted the effective tax rate. The impact of PST on the effective tax rate was partially offset by the
continued strong performance of the U.S. operations which, due to a full valuation allowance, positively impacted the effective
tax rate.

(14) Segment Reporting  

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
that are evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company's chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer. 

The Company has three reportable segments, Control Devices,
Electronics and PST, which also represent its operating segments. The Control Devices reportable segment produces sensors, switches,
valves and actuators. The Electronics reportable segment produces electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units and
driver information systems. The PST reportable segment designs and manufactures electronic vehicle security alarms, convenience
accessories, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and in-vehicle audio and video devices.

interest in PST increased to $13,704 at   September 30, 2016 due to comprehensive income of $394 resulting from a favorable
change in foreign currency translation of $2,403 partially offset by a proportionate share of its net loss of $2,009 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. Noncontrolling interest in PST decreased to $14,273 at September 30, 2015 due to comprehensive
loss of $8,277 resulting from a proportionate share of its net loss of $1,074 and an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation
of $7,203 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Comprehensive loss related to PST noncontrolling interest was $(467) and
$(4,080) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

PST has dividends payable declared in previous years to noncontrolling
interest of $10,842 Brazilian real ($3,340) at September 30, 2016.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

Background   

We are a global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered
electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive, commercial, motorcycle, off-highway and agricultural
vehicle markets. 

Segments   

We are primarily organized by products produced and markets
served. Under this structure, our continuing operations have been reported utilizing the following segments: 

Control Devices.  This segment includes results of operations
that manufacture sensors, switches, valves and actuators. 

Electronics.  This segment includes results of operations
from the production of electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units and driver information systems. 

PST.  This segment includes results of operations that
design and manufacture electronic vehicle alarms, convenience accessories, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and
in-vehicle audio and video devices. 

Third Quarter Overview   

Income from continuing operations attributable to Stoneridge.
Inc. of $10.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $2.8 million, or
$0.09 per diluted share from $7.5 million, or $0.27 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in income from continuing operations is primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $4.6 million related to higher sales in
our Control Devices segment and lower material costs in our Electronics and PST segments resulting from a favorable change in
foreign currency exchange rates. This was partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs
primarily in our unallocated corporate segment (which included $0.7 million in costs associated with our headquarter relocation),
and a $0.9 million increase in income tax expense. 

Net sales increased by $11.8 million, or 7.3%, compared to
the third quarter of 2015 as higher sales in our Control Devices segment were partially offset by lower sales in our PST and Electronics
segments. The increase in sales in our Control Devices segment was primarily due to new product sales in the North American automotive
market while our PST segment sales decreased due to weakness in the Brazilian economy and automotive market. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash and
cash equivalents balances of $50.6 million and $54.4 million, respectively. The decrease during the first nine months of 2016
was primarily due to higher working capital, capital expenditures and repayment of debt, which was partially offset by net income.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had $87.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding on
our $300.0 million Credit Facility. 

Outlook   

We expect our financial performance to improve in the fourth
quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 because of new product launches and savings from previously incurred business
realignment activities. 

We expect to continue to have significant growth in our North
American automotive vehicle sales in 2016 related to new product launches primarily our shift by wire product in our Control Devices
segment. Also, the North American automotive vehicle market production is expected to increase to approximately 17.9 million units
in 2016 (an increase from the 17.5 million units produced in 2015), which we expect to have a favorable effect on our Control
Devices segment. 

24  

The North American commercial vehicle market is expected to
decline for the remainder of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2016. The European commercial vehicle market is forecasted
to have a modest increase for the remainder of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2016. 

Our PST segment revenues and operating performance continue
to be adversely impacted by weakness of the Brazilian economy and automotive market, and has been negatively impacted by unfavorable
foreign currency translation. In October 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasted the Brazil gross domestic product
( GDP ) to decline 3.3% in 2016 and increase 0.5% in 2017. Based on the forecasted negative GDP growth of the Brazilian
economy in 2016, PST s sales and earnings expectations continue to be moderated. Because there is significant uncertainty
regarding the timing and magnitude of a recovery in the Brazilian economy and automotive market, the Company continues to realign
PST s cost structure to mitigate the effect on earnings and cash flows of possible continued weakened product demand and
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. 

We regularly evaluate the performance of our businesses and
their cost structures, including personnel, and make necessary changes thereto in order to optimize our results.  We
also evaluate the required skill sets of our personnel and periodically make strategic changes.  As a consequence of these
actions, we incur severance related costs which we refer to as business realignment charges. 

A significant portion of our sales are outside of the United
States. These sales are generated by our non-U.S. based operations, and therefore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates
can have a significant effect on our results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant portion of our
raw materials purchased by our Electronics and PST segments are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore movements in foreign
currency exchange rates can also have a significant effect on our results of operations. While the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly
against the Swedish krona, euro and Brazilian real in 2015 increasing our material costs and reducing our reported results, the
U.S. dollar weakened against these currencies in the first nine months of 2016. 

Because of the competitive nature of the markets we serve,
we face pricing pressures from our customers in the ordinary course of business. In response to these pricing pressures we have
been able to effectively manage our production costs by the combination of lowering certain costs and limiting the increase of
others, the net impact of which has not been material. However, if we are unable to effectively manage production costs in the
future to mitigate future pricing pressures, our results of operations would be adversely affected. 

In March 2016, we announced the relocation of our corporate
headquarters from Warren, Ohio to Novi, Michigan, which will occur primarily during the fourth quarter of 2016.  As a result,
the Company will incur relocation costs of approximately $2.8 million to $3.4 million including employee retention, relocation,
severance, recruiting, duplicate wages and professional fees.  The new headquarters will expand our presence in the Detroit
metropolitan area and improve access to key customers, decision makers and influencers in the automotive and commercial vehicle
markets that we serve.  In connection with the relocation, the Company is eligible for a Michigan Business Development Program
grant of up to $1.4 million based upon the number of new jobs created in Michigan, along with talent services and training support
from Oakland County Michigan Works!.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Condensed consolidated statements of operations as a percentage
of net sales are presented in the following table (in thousands):    

Net Sales.  Net sales for our reportable segments, excluding
inter-segment sales, are summarized in the following table (in thousands):    

Our Control Devices segment net sales increased primarily due
to new product sales and growth in the North American automotive market of $18.3 million and new program sales and increased sales
volume in the China automotive market of $1.4 million during the third quarter of 2016, which were offset by a decrease in commercial
vehicle and various other markets of $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. 

Our Electronics segment net sales declined as the increase
in sales volume in our European commercial vehicle products of $3.0 million was more than offset by a decrease in sales volume
of our North American commercial vehicle and European off-highway vehicle products of $3.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively,
and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of $1.2 million. 

26  

Our PST segment net sales decreased primarily due to continued
weakness in the Brazilian economy and automotive market which was partially offset by a favorable foreign currency translation
that increased sales by $2.0 million, or 8.2%. PST s monitoring service sales modestly increased but was more than offset
by a decline in product sales volume. 

Net sales by geographic location are summarized in the following
table (in thousands):    

The increase in North American net sales was primarily attributable
to new product sales and growth in our North American automotive market of $18.3 million, which was partially offset by decreased
sales volume in our North American commercial vehicle market and various other markets of $5.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
The decrease in net sales in South America was primarily due to a decrease in product sales volume as a result of continued weakness
in the Brazilian economy and automotive market which was partially offset by a favorable foreign currency translation. The increase
in net sales in Europe and Other was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our European commercial vehicle products
of $3.0 million and new program sales and increased sales volume in our China automotive market of $1.4 million, which were partially
offset by a sales volume decrease of our European off-highway vehicle products of $1.2 million as well as an unfavorable foreign
currency translation of $1.2 million. 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin.  Cost of goods sold
increased by 6.1% primarily related to an increase in net sales in our Control Devices segment. Our gross margin improved by 0.7%
to 28.6% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 27.9% for the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to lower material costs in
our Electronics and PST segments. Our material cost as a percentage of net sales decreased by 0.7% to 50.7% for the third quarter
of 2016 compared to 51.4% for the third quarter of 2015 while our aggregated labor and overhead costs as a percentage of sales
remained level. The lower direct material costs in our Electronics and PST segments were partially offset by higher direct material
costs in our Control Devices segment related to a change in product mix. 

Our Control Devices segment gross margin decreased as the benefit
of increased sales was more than offset by higher warranty related costs and was negatively impacted by an unfavorable mix of
products sold. 

Our Electronics segment gross margin improved primarily due
to lower material costs resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Our PST segment gross margin increased due to lower direct
material costs related to a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, but was negatively impacted by a decrease in
sales volume. 

Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ).
 SG A expenses increased by $1.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher costs related to
the corporate headquarter relocation (including employee retention, relocation, severance, recruiting and duplicate wages) totaling
$0.7 million as well as higher wages, share-based compensation (partially resulting from the modification of the retirement notice
provisions of certain awards) and professional fees in our unallocated corporate segment. This increase was partially offset by
a slight decrease in SG A expenses in our Control Devices, Electronics and PST segments, a portion of which relates to business
realignment charges which decreased by $0.3 million. 

Design and Development ( D D ).  D D
costs increased by $0.3 million primarily due to higher costs related to new product launches in our Control Devices segment and
product development costs in our Electronics segment which were partially offset by lower employee costs in our PST segment as
a result of business realignment actions. 

27  

Operating Income.  Operating income (loss) is summarized
in the following table by continuing reportable segment (in thousands): 

Our Control Devices segment operating income increased primarily
due to an increase in sales which was partially offset by higher D D and warranty related costs. 

Our Electronics segment operating income increased despite
lower sales primarily due to lower material and SG A costs, which were partially offset by higher D D costs. 

Our PST segment operating performance improved primarily due
to lower D D costs resulting from business realignment actions and higher gross profit from lower material costs and a $0.2
million decrease in business realignment costs. PST s improved operating performance is expected to continue in the fourth
quarter of 2016. 

Our unallocated corporate operating loss increased primarily
due to costs related to the corporate headquarter relocation as well as higher wages, share-based compensation and professional
fees. 

Operating income (loss) by geographic location is summarized
in the following table (in thousands): 

Our North American operating results improved primarily due
to increased sales in the North American automotive market, which were partially offset by higher wages, share-based compensation,
professional fees and costs related to the headquarter relocation. The improved performance in South America was primarily due
to lower D D employee costs resulting from business realignment actions, higher gross profit resulting from lower material
costs and a $0.2 million decrease in business realignment costs. Our operating results in Europe and Other improved due primarily
to lower material costs resulting from a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales of European commercial
vehicle and China automotive products. 

Interest Expense, net.  Interest expense, net decreased
by $0.1 million compared to the prior year third quarter primarily due to a lower interest rate related to our Credit Facility. 

Equity in Earnings of Investee.  Equity earnings for
Minda were $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in
Minda s income from operations compared to the prior period was partially offset by an unfavorable change in foreign currency
exchange rates. 

Other Income, net . We record certain foreign currency
transaction and forward currency hedge contract (gains) losses as a component of other income, net on the condensed consolidated
statement of operations. Other income, net increased by $0.4 million to $0.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 primarily due
to an increase in foreign currency gains and several other items. The favorable change in certain foreign currency exchange rates
in our unallocated corporate and Electronics segments were partially offset by an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange
rates in our PST segment. 

28  

Expense for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations. 
We recognized income tax expense of $0.9 million and less than $0.1 million from continuing operations for federal, state and
foreign income taxes for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period for 2015 was primarily due to the increase in consolidated earnings. Also,
income tax expense increased due to the PST operating loss which generated a benefit for the third quarter of 2015, however, due
to the valuation allowance position taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, no longer provides a tax benefit in 2016. The effective
tax rate increased to 8.4% in the third quarter of 2016 from 0.4% in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to a full valuation
allowance on PST s loss that negatively impacted the effective tax rate. The impact of PST on the effective tax rate was
partially offset by the continued strong performance of our U.S. operations which, due to a full valuation allowance, positively
impacted the effective tax rate. 

We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on
our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.
As a result of the sale of the Wiring business and debt refinancing during the second half of 2014 and actual and anticipated
earnings of the U.S. operations, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that additional positive evidence may continue
to develop in the near term that may allow us to reach a conclusion that some or all of the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred
tax assets will no longer be needed. Reversal of some or all of the U.S. valuation allowance would result in the recognition of
certain deferred tax assets and an income tax benefit in the period the reversal is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount
of a valuation allowance reversal depends upon the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. 

29  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Condensed consolidated statements of operations as a percentage
of net sales are presented in the following table (in thousands): 

Net Sales.    Net
sales for our reportable segments, excluding inter-segment sales, are summarized in the following table (in thousands):     

Our Control Devices segment net sales increased primarily due
to new product sales and growth in the North American automotive market of $54.8 million and new program sales and increased sales
volume in the China automotive market of $3.5 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in various other markets of $2.1
million and our North American commercial vehicle market of $0.5 million during the first nine months of 2016. 

Our Electronics segment net sales decreased primarily due to
a decrease in sales volume in our North American commercial vehicle products of $9.6 million, an unfavorable foreign currency translation
of $1.7 million and a decrease in our European off-highway vehicle products of $0.9 million, which were partially offset by an
increase in sales volume in our European commercial vehicle products of $5.9 million. 

30  

Our PST segment net sales decreased primarily due to an unfavorable
foreign currency translation which reduced sales by $7.9 million, or 10.7%, and lower product volume as a result of continued weakness
in the Brazilian economy and automotive market while monitoring service sales volume modestly increased. 

Net sales by geographic location are summarized in the following
table (in thousands):    

The increase in North American net sales was primarily attributable
to new product sales and growth in the North American automotive market of $54.8 million, which was partially offset by decreased
sales volume in the North American commercial vehicle market of $9.6 million and decreased sales in various other markets of $2.1
million. The decrease in net sales in South America was due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation as well as lower product
sales volume as a result of continued weakness in the Brazilian economy and automotive market. The increase in net sales in Europe
and Other was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our European commercial vehicle products of $5.9 million and new
program sales and increased sales volume in our China automotive market of $3.5 million, which were partially offset by an unfavorable
foreign currency translation of $1.7 million and lower sales of European off-highway vehicle products of $0.9 million. 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin.  Cost of goods sold
increased by 5.7% primarily related to an increase in sales in our Control Devices segment. Our gross margin improved by 0.7%
to 28.2% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 27.5% for the first nine months of 2015. Our material cost as a percentage
of net sales increased by 0.1% to 51.5% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 51.4% for the first nine months of 2015
while aggregated labor and overhead costs as a percentage of sales improved by 0.8% due to increased sales and a change in product
mix in our Control Devices segment. The lower material costs in our Electronics and PST segments due to a favorable change in
foreign currency exchange rates were offset by higher direct material costs as a percentage of sales in our Control Devices segment
due to a change in mix of products sold. 

Our Control Devices segment gross margin improved slightly
primarily due to the benefit of increased sales levels which was partially offset by higher warranty related costs and was negatively
impacted by an unfavorable change in mix of products sold. 

Our Electronics segment gross margin improved primarily due
to lower material costs resulting from a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Our PST segment gross margin improved due to lower material
costs resulting from a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which was partially offset by lower sales volume
and a $0.1 million increase in business realignment charges. 

Selling, General and Administrative.  SG A expenses
decreased by $2.7 million compared to the first nine months of 2015 as lower SG A costs in our PST and Electronics segments
were partially offset by higher SG A costs in our unallocated corporate segment.  PST SG A costs decreased primarily
due to lower employee costs as a result of business realignment actions, lower selling related expenses and professional fees
and from movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which were partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in business realignment
costs.  SG A expenses in our Electronics segment decreased primarily due from movement in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Unallocated corporate SG A costs increased due to costs associated with the corporate headquarter relocation (including employee
retention, relocation, severance, recruiting, other professional fees and duplicate wages) totaling $1.0 million as well as higher
wages, incentive-based compensation (as a result of improved financial performance) and consulting fees.  These higher unallocated
corporate SG A costs were partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense as the additional expense related to
modification of the retirement notice provisions of certain share-based awards of $0.5 million for the first nine months of 2016
were more than offset by $2.2 million of expense for the acceleration of the vesting associated with the retirement of our President
and Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) during the first nine months of 2015. 

31  

Design and Development.  D D costs increased by $1.2
million primarily due to development costs related to new product launches in our Control Devices segment as well as higher product
development costs and business realignment charges in our Electronics segment. Business realignment charges related to our Electronics
segment increased by $0.8 million during the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015. This increase in D D costs in our
Control Devices and Electronics segments was partially offset by lower employee costs as a result of business realignment actions,
lower product design costs and movement in foreign currency exchange rates in our PST segment. 

Operating Income.  
 Operating income (loss) is summarized in the following table by continuing reportable segment (in
thousands):  

Our Control Devices segment operating income increased primarily
due to an increase in sales, which was partially offset by higher D D costs related to new product launches and higher warranty
related costs. 

Our Electronics segment operating income increased primarily
due to lower material costs, which was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in business realignment charges and lower sales
during the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015. 

Our PST segment operating performance improved primarily due
to lower SG A and D D expenses due to business realignment actions, lower selling expenses and professional fees. These
were partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from lower product sales volume as well as an increase in business realignment
charges of $0.8 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015. 

Our unallocated corporate operating loss increased primarily
due to higher costs associated with the corporate headquarter relocation as well as higher wages, incentive-based compensation
and professional fees. These were partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense because the first nine months of 2015
included $2.2 million of expense for the acceleration of the vesting associated with the retirement of our President and CEO while
the first nine months of 2016 had $0.5 million of expense related to the modification of the retirement notice provisions of certain
awards. 

Operating income (loss) by geographic location is summarized
in the following table (in thousands): 

32  

Our North American operating results improved primarily due
to increased sales in the North American automotive market which was partially offset by higher SG A expenses in our unallocated
corporate segment and higher D D and warranty related costs in our Control Devices segment. The improvement in performance
in South America was primarily due to lower SG A and D D employee expenses resulting from business realignment actions,
lower selling costs and professional fees which was partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from lower product sales volume
and a $0.8 million increase in business realignment costs. Our results in Europe and Other improved as higher D D costs, an
increase in product development and business realignment charges were more than offset by higher gross profit benefiting from lower
material costs as well as lower SG A expenses. 

Interest Expense, net.  Interest expense, net increased
by $0.4 million compared to the prior year first nine months primarily due to a higher weighted-average interest rate related to
our PST debt. 

Equity in Earnings of Investee.  Equity earnings for Minda
were $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in Minda s
income from operations compared to the prior period was partially offset by an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange
rates. 

Other Income, net . We record certain foreign currency
transaction and forward currency hedge contract (gains) losses as a component of other income, net on the condensed consolidated
statement of operations. Other income, net increased by $0.4 million compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to an increase
in foreign currency gains and several other items. The favorable change in foreign currency exchange rates in our unallocated corporate
and Electronics segments were partially offset by an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates in our PST segment. 

Expense (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations. 
We recognized income tax expense (benefit) of $3.1 million and $(0.2) million from continuing operations for federal, state and
foreign income taxes for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period for 2015 was primarily due to the increase in consolidated earnings.
Also, income tax expense increased due to the PST operating loss which generated a benefit for the first nine months of 2015, however,
due to the valuation allowance position taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, no longer provides a tax benefit in 2016. The effective
tax rate increased to 10.3% in the first nine months of 2016 from (1.3)% in the first nine months of 2015 primarily due to a full
valuation allowance on PST s loss that negatively impacted the effective tax rate. The impact of PST on the effective tax
rate was partially offset by the continued strong performance of our U.S. operations which, due to a full valuation allowance,
positively impacted the effective tax rate. 

We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our
U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance. As
a result of the sale of the Wiring business and debt refinancing during the second half of 2014 and actual and anticipated earnings
of the U.S. operations, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that additional positive evidence may continue to develop
in the near term that may allow us to reach a conclusion that some or all of the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets
will no longer be needed. Reversal of some or all of the U.S. valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred
tax assets and an income tax benefit in the period the reversal is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of a valuation
allowance reversal depends upon the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. 

33  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Summary of Cash Flows (in thousands):     

Cash provided by operating activities, which includes cash flows
from the Wiring discontinued operations in 2015, increased primarily due to lower working capital movement and an increase in net
income. Our receivable terms and collections rates have remained consistent between periods presented. 

Net cash used for investing activities decreased primarily due
to lower capital expenditures in the current period. Also, there were payments related to the sale of the Wiring business in the
prior period which did not recur in 2016. 

Net cash used for financing activities increased primarily due
to an unplanned partial repayment of our Credit Facility and lower PST borrowings incurred in the current period. 

As outlined in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial
statements, our Credit Facility permits borrowing up to a maximum level of $300.0 million which includes an accordion feature which
allows the Company to increase the availability by up to $80.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. This variable
rate facility provides the flexibility to refinance other outstanding debt or finance acquisitions through September 2021. The
Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain less than a maximum leverage ratio and
more than a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of
default that are customary for credit arrangements of this type including covenants which place restrictions and/or limitations
on the Company s ability to borrow money, make capital expenditures and pay dividends. The Credit Facility had an outstanding
balance of $87.0 million at September 30, 2016. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2016. The covenants
included in our Credit Facility to date have not and are not expected to limit our financing flexibility. 

PST maintains several short-term obligations and long-term loans
used for working capital purposes. At September 30, 2016, there was $18.0 million of PST debt outstanding.  Scheduled
principal repayments on PST debt at September 30, 2016 were as follows: $9.7 million from October 2016 to September 2017, $1.0
million from October 2017 to December 2017, $4.0 million in 2018, $2.6 million in 2019, $0.4 million in 2020 and $0.3 million in
2021.  

The Company's wholly owned subsidiary located in Stockholm,
Sweden, has an overdraft credit line which allows overdrafts on the subsidiary's bank account up to a maximum level of 20.0 million
Swedish krona, or $2.3 million, at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, there were no overdrafts on the bank account. 

Due to the deterioration of the Brazilian economy and automotive
market in 2015 and first nine months of 2016, PST had lower earnings and cash flows.  Also, PST has experienced slower customer
payments of receivables, which combined with lower earnings has made its liquidity more challenging.  As such, PST has and
continues to evaluate and utilize several funding sources including factoring receivables and short-term loans from banks to provide
necessary funding.  

Although the Company's notes and credit facilities contain various
covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude their use or accelerate the maturity, the Company has not experienced
and does not expect these covenants to restrict our financing flexibility. The Company has been and expects to continue to remain
in compliance with these covenants during the term of the notes and credit facilities.

Our future results could also be adversely affected by unfavorable
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant foreign denominated transaction exposure in certain locations,
especially in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Sweden, Estonia and China. We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
reduce our exposure related to certain foreign currency fluctuations. See Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements
for additional details. Our future results could also be unfavorably affected by increased commodity prices as commodity fluctuations
impact the cost of our raw material purchases.  

At September 30, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance
of approximately $50.6 million, of which $18.2 million was held in the United States and $32.4 million was held in foreign locations.
The decrease from $54.4 million at December 31, 2015 was due to repayment of debt, higher working capital and capital expenditures
which were offset by net income during the first nine months of 2016. 

Commitments and Contingencies   

See Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements
for disclosures of the Company s commitments and contingencies. 

Seasonality   

Our Control Devices and Electronics segments
are not typically affected by seasonality, however the demand for our PST segment consumer products is typically higher in the
second half of the year, the fourth quarter in particular. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The Company's critical accounting policies, which include management's
best estimates and judgments, are included in Part II, Item 7, to the consolidated financial statements of the Company's 2015 Form
10-K. These accounting policies are considered critical as disclosed in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section
of Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's 2015 Form 10-K because of the potential for a significant impact on the
financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty in such estimates. 

Information regarding other significant accounting policies
is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Company s 2015 Form 10-K. 

Inflation and International Presence   

Given the current economic conditions of countries and recent
fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, we believe that a negative change in such items could
significantly affect our profitability.   

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

There have been no material changes in market risk presented
within Part II, Item 7A of the Company's 2015 Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of September 30, 2016, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the principal executive officer ( PEO )
and principal financial officer ( PFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company's management, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

35  

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER
INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

We are involved in certain legal actions and claims primarily
arising in the ordinary course of business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters,
we do not believe that any of the litigation in which we are currently engaged, either individually or in the aggregate, will have
a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are subject to a tax assessment
in Brazil related to value added taxes on vehicle tracking and monitoring services for which the likelihood of loss is not probable
although it may take years to resolve. In addition, we are subject to litigation regarding patent infringement. We are also subject
to the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the failure of any of our products causes personal injury
or death to users of our products as well as product warranty and recall claims. There can be no assurance that we will not experience
any material losses related to product liability, warranty or recall claims. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective,
we may be required to participate in a government-imposed or customer OEM-instituted recall involving such products. See additional
details of these matters in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

There have been no material changes with respect to risk factors
previously disclosed in the Company's 2015 Form 10-K. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds  

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures  

None. 

Item 5. Other Information  

None.
