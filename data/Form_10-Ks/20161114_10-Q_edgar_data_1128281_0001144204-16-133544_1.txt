NOTE 1 -  Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of Saker Aviation Services, Inc. (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial statements
and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required
by GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related footnotes included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The condensed consolidated balance sheet and statements of cash
flows as of September 30, 2016 and the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of the Company s management, all necessary
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been included to make the Company s financial position as of September
30, 2016 and its results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 not misleading. The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for any full year or any other interim period. 

NOTE 2    Liquidity  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents
of $2,084,576 and a working capital surplus of $2,815,460. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated
revenue from continuing operations of $10,872,366 and had net income from continuing operations before taxes of $1,348,252. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows included net cash provided by operating activities of $1,915,570, net cash
used in investing activities of $40,781, and net cash used in financing activities of $204,874. 

On May 17, 2013, we entered into a loan agreement with PNC Bank
(the  PNC Loan Agreement ). The PNC Loan Agreement contained three components: (i) a $2,500,000 non-revolving acquisition
line of credit (the  PNC Acquisition Line ); (ii) a $1,150,000 working capital line (the  PNC Working Capital
Line ); and (iii) a $280,920 term loan (the  PNC Term Loan ). 

Proceeds of the PNC Acquisition Line were able to be dispersed,
based on parameters defined in the PNC Loan Agreement, until May 17, 2014 (the  Conversion Date ). As of the Conversion
Date, there was $1,350,000 outstanding under the PNC Acquisition Line. The payment terms provided that 30 days following the Conversion
Date, and continuing on the same day of each month thereafter, the Company is required to make equal payments of principal over
a 60 month period. Interest on the outstanding principal continues to accrue at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 275 basis
points (3.26% as of September 30, 2016). As of September 30, 2016, there was $720,000 outstanding under the PNC Acquisition Line. 

The PNC Working Capital Line was to have been dispersed for
working capital and general corporate purposes. Interest on outstanding principal accrued at a rate equal to daily LIBOR plus 250
basis points. The PNC Working Capital Line expired on December 31, 2015, with $0 outstanding. 

The PNC Term Loan was utilized to retire our previously outstanding
miscellaneous debt of the same amount. Interest on outstanding principal accrued at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 275 basis
points and principal and interest payments were to be made over a thirty-four month period. At December 31, 2015, all amounts under
the PNC Term loan have been repaid. 

The Company is party to a Concession Agreement, dated as of
November 1, 2008, with the City of New York for the operation of the Downtown Manhattan Heliport (the  Concession Agreement ).
Pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement, the Company must pay the greater of 18% of the first $5,000,000 in program year
gross receipts and 25% of gross receipts in excess of $5 million or minimum annual guaranteed payments. The Company paid the City
of New York $1,200,000 in the first year of the term and minimum payments were scheduled to increase to approximately $1,700,000
in the final year of Concession Agreement which, in accordance with an Amendment to the Concession Agreement dated July 13, 2016
(the  Amendment ) between the Company and the New York City Economic Development Corporation ( NYCEDC ),
expires on April 30, 2021. In addition to the extension of the base term, pursuant to the Amendment the City of New York has two
one year options to further extend the Concession Agreement. The Amendment also calls for certain reductions in air tour activity
at the Heliport as well as reductions to the Company s minimum annual guaranteed payments, which are described in greater
detail in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
on April 11, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred approximately $1,900,000 and
$2,100,000, respectively, in concession fees which are recorded in the cost of revenue. The Amendment was included as an exhibit
to the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016. 

6   

         SAKER AVIATION SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (UNAUDITED)    

The air tour reductions discussed in the Amendment are expected
to negatively impact the Company s business and financial results as well as those of the Company s management company
Empire Aviation which, as previously disclosed, is owned by the children of Alvin Trenk, the Company s CEO and a member of
its Board of Directors.  The Company incurred management fees with Empire Aviation of approximately $2,706,000 and $2,711,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is recorded in administrative expenses.  The
Company and Empire Aviation have also contributed to the Helicopter Tourism and Jobs Council ( HTJC ), an association
that lobbies on behalf of the helicopter air tour industry, and which had engaged in discussions with the City of New York Mayor s
office in connection with the Amendment.  Mr. Trenk is also an active participant with HJTC, which is managed by his grandson. 

As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
SEC on July 6, 2015, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2015, by and between the Company and Warren
A. Peck (the  Stock Agreement ). The details of the Stock Purchase Agreement are described in greater detail in such
Current Report as well as in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 11, 2016. 

On September 30, 2015, the Company and Mr. Peck executed a Closing
Cash Agreement ( the  Closing Agreement ), which was filed with the Company s Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015. The Closing Agreement provided for Mr. Peck to assign to the Company title to an
aircraft in order to defer the $250,000 cash consideration due at closing. As further described in the Closing Agreement, the Company
is to receive the $250,000 closing cash payment, plus other identified costs, when the aircraft is subsequently sold. On June 13,
2016, the Company entered into a sale agreement (the  Sale Agreement ) with an unrelated third party to acquire the
aircraft subject to the Closing Agreement. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, the Company received a down-payment of $30,000,
which was credited against the $250,000 cash consideration owed by Mr. Peck. In addition, beginning in October 2016, the Company
will receive monthly payments of at least $28,000 to satisfy the remainder of the $250,000 cash consideration and $50,000 of the
Note owed by Mr. Peck. The $220,000 remaining balance of closing cash consideration, plus receivables associated with the Note,
are reflected as a Note Receivable as of September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 3 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Principles of Consolidation  

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, FirstFlight Heliports, LLC ( FFH ), our FBO at Garden City (Kansas)
Regional Airport ( FBOGC ) and Phoenix Rising Aviation, Inc. ( PRA ), see Note 5, Discontinued Operations.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications  

 Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to
conform to the current year presentation. None of the reclassifications affected the Company s net income in any period. 

Net Income Per Common Share  

 Net income was $667,252 and $395,846 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Basic net income per share applicable to common stockholders is computed based on the
weighted average number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted net income
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other instruments to issue common stock were exercised
or converted into common stock. Potentially dilutive securities, consisting of options and warrants, are excluded from the calculation
of the diluted income per share when their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during
the period.  

7   

         SAKER AVIATION SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (UNAUDITED)    

The following table sets forth the components used in the computation
of basic net income per share: 

Stock Based Compensation  

 Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards are based on the grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes these compensation costs over the requisite service
period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
incurred stock-based compensation costs of $25,496. Such amounts have been recorded as part of the Company s selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2016, the
unamortized fair value of the options totaled $8,000. 

Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected life of the option. In management's opinion, the use of such option valuation models does not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company s employee stock options. Management holds
this view partly because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and also because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360)   Reporting
Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  (ASU 2014-08) which requires entities to
change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhance convergence of the FASB s and International Accounting
Standard Board s (IASB) reporting requirements for discontinued operations so as not to be overly complex or difficult to
apply to stakeholders. Only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have)
a major effect on the entity s operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial
statements. ASU 2014-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2014 and interim periods thereafter. ASU
2014-08 is effective for the Company s financial statements for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2015. Based on the Company s
evaluation of ASU 2014-08, the adoption of this statement on January 1, 2015 did not have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements. 

NOTE 4 -  Inventories  

Inventories consist primarily of aviation fuel which the Company
sells to its customers. The Company also maintains fuel inventories for commercial airlines, to which it charges into-plane fees
when servicing commercial aircraft. A summary of inventories as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is set forth in the
table below: 

Included in inventories are amounts held for third parties of
$53,562 and $55,798 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, with an offsetting liability included as part
of accrued expenses.

NOTE 5    Discontinued Operations  

The Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated June
30, 2015, by and between the Company and Warren A. Peck (the  Agreement ). The Agreement is discussed in greater detail
in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed July 6,2015, as well as in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed
with the SEC on April 11, 2016. 

Components of discontinued operations are as follows: 

NOTE 6    Related Parties  

From time to time, the law firm of Wachtel   Missry, LLP
provides certain legal services to the Company and its subsidiaries. William B. Wachtel, Chairman of the Company s Board
of Directors, is a managing partner of such firm. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no services were provided
to the Company by Wachtel   Missry, LLP. 

As described in Note 2, Liquidity, the Company is party to a
management agreement with Empire Aviation, an entity owned by the children of Alvin S. Trenk, the Company s CEO and a member
of the Company s Board of Directors. 

NOTE 7 -  Litigation  

From time to time, the Company and/or its subsidiaries may be
a party to one or more claims or disputes which may result in litigation. The Company's management does not, however, presently
expect that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Note 8    Subsequent Events  

The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, FBO Air Garden
City, Inc. ( GCK ), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated October 3, 2016, by and between the Company and
Gary and Kim Keller, to purchase all of the capital stock of Aircraft Services, Inc. ( Aircraft Services ), an aircraft
maintenance services firm located in Garden City, Kansas. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company made a $150,000 cash
payment at closing and will make installment payments totaling an additional $150,000 over the next two years. The closing cash
payment for the transaction was funded with internal resources. The Stock Purchase Agreement is discussed in greater detail in
a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 7, 2016 and is filed as an Exhibit to this report.

Item 2    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion
should be read together with the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes in this report. This
Item 2 contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied
in such forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed throughout this
report and include, but are not limited to, those set forth at the end of this Item 2 under the heading  Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward Looking Statements.  Additional factors are under the heading  Risk Factors  in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The terms  we,   us, 
and  our  are used below to refer collectively to the Company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses
are actually conducted. 

OVERVIEW 

Saker Aviation Services,
Inc. is a Nevada corporation. Our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the  common stock ), is publicly traded
on the OTCQB Marketplace ( OTCQB ) under the symbol  SKAS . Through our subsidiaries, we operate in the
aviation services segment of the general aviation industry, in which we serve as the operator of a heliport, a fixed base operation
( FBO ), as a provider of aircraft maintenance services , and as a consultant for a seaplane base that we do not own.
FBOs provide ground-based services, such as fueling and aircraft storage for general aviation, commercial and military aircraft,
and other miscellaneous services. 

We were formed on January
17, 2003 as a proprietorship and were incorporated in Arizona on January 2, 2004. We became a public company as a result of a reverse
merger transaction on August 20, 2004 with Shadows Bend Development, Inc., an inactive public Nevada corporation, and subsequently
changed our name to FBO Air, Inc. On December 12, 2006, we changed our name to FirstFlight, Inc. On September 2, 2009, we changed
our name to Saker Aviation Services, Inc. 

Our business activities
are carried out as the operator of the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport, as an FBO and provider of aircraft maintenance services
at the Garden City (Kansas) Regional Airport, as a consultant to the operator of a seaplane base in New York City, and prior to
our divestiture, as a provider of aircraft maintenance services at the Bartlesville (Oklahoma) Municipal Airport. 

The Garden City facility
became part of our company as a result of our acquisition of the FBO assets of Central Plains Aviation, Inc. ( CPA )
in March 2005 and our acquisition of Aircraft Services in October 2016 (see Note 8. Subsequent Events). 

Our business activities
at the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport facility (the  Heliport ) commenced as a result of the Company s
award of the Concession Agreement by the City of New York to operate the Heliport, which we assigned to our subsidiary, FirstFlight
Heliports, LLC d/b/a Saker Aviation Services ( FFH ). See Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements
included in Item 1 of this report. 

The FBO segment of
the general aviation industry is highly fragmented. According to the National Air Transportation Association ( NATA ),
there are over 3,000 FBOs that serve customers at one or more of over 3,000 airport facilities across the country that have at
least one paved 3,000-foot runway. The vast majority of these entities are single location operators. NATA characterizes companies
with operations at three or more airports as  chains.  An operation with FBOs in at least two distinctive regions of
the country is considered a  national  chain while an operation with FBOs in multiple locations within a single region
is considered a  regional  chain. 

As described in greater
detail below in Liquidity and Capital Resources, upcoming reductions to the number of air tours emanating from the Heliport is
expected to have a negative impact on our operations. The first and second stages of these reductions were initiated on June 1,
2016, and October 1, 2016, respectively.

REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS 

Comparison of Continuing Operations
for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  

REVENUE  

Revenue from continuing
operations decreased by 18.8 percent to $3,840,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with corresponding
prior-year period revenue of $4,730,000. 

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, revenue from continuing operations associated with the sale of jet fuel, aviation gasoline and related
items decreased by 19.6 percent to approximately $1,551,000 as compared to approximately $1,928,000 in the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was largely attributable to a lower volume of gallons, primarily associated with fueling at our Heliport
operation. This decrease was related to the initiation of the air tour reductions which took effect on June 1, 2016. 

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, revenue from continuing operations associated with services and supply items decreased by 18.2 percent
to approximately $2,273,000 as compared to approximately $2,778,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
was attributable to the same factor identified above. 

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, all other revenue from continuing operations decreased by 28.0 percent to approximately $17,000 as compared
to approximately $23,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was largely attributable to a decrease in miscellaneous
revenue generated by our Heliport compared to the same period last year. 

Revenue from continuing
operations decreased by 7.7 percent to $10,872,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with corresponding
prior-year period revenue of $11,775,000. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, revenue from continuing operations associated with the sale of jet fuel, aviation gasoline and related
items decreased by 8.1 percent to approximately $4,330,000 as compared to approximately $4,710,000 in the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was largely attributable to a lower volume of gallons, primarily associated with fueling at our Heliport
operation. This decrease was related to the initiation of the air tour reductions which took effect on June 1, 2016. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, revenue from continuing operations associated with services and supply items decreased by 6.6 percent
to approximately $6,496,000 as compared to approximately $6,958,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was
attributable to the same factor identified above. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, all other revenue from continuing operations decreased by 56.5 percent to approximately $47,000 as compared
to approximately $107,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was largely attributable to a decrease in miscellaneous
revenue generated by our Heliport compared to the same period last year. 

GROSS PROFIT  

Total gross profit
from continuing operations decreased 6.3 percent to $2,320,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin increased to 60.4 percent in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to 52.3 percent in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit is related to lower levels of gross profit in
our fuel sales, as well as lower levels of activity at our Heliport operation in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the prior year. The increase in gross margin is related to reduced costs associated with providing services at our Heliport
operation. 

Total gross profit
from continuing operations decreased 4.8 percent to $6,114,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin increased to 56.2 percent in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to 54.5 percent in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit and increase in gross margin are attributable
to the same factors identified above. 

11   

OPERATING EXPENSE  

Selling, General and Administrative

Total selling, general
and administrative expenses, or SG A, from continuing operations were approximately $1,747,000 in the three months ended September
30, 2016, representing a decrease of approximately $86,000 or 4.7 percent, as compared to the same period in 2015. Total selling,
general and administrative expenses, or SG A, from continuing operations were $4,744,000 in the nine months ended September
30, 2016, representing a decrease of approximately $148,000 or 3.0 percent, as compared to the same period in 2015. 

SG A associated
with continuing operations of our aviation services operations were approximately $1,618,000 in the three months ended September
30, 2016, representing a decrease of approximately $160,000 or 9.0 percent, as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015. SG A associated with our continuing FBO operations, as a percentage of revenue, was 42.1 percent for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared with 37.6 percent in the corresponding prior year period. The decreased operating expenses
were largely attributable to reduced costs related to the lower levels of activity in our Heliport operations. 

SG A associated
with continuing operations of our aviation services operations were approximately $4,382,000 in the nine months ended September
30, 2016, representing a decrease of approximately $274,000 or 5.9 percent, as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015. SG A associated with our continuing FBO operations, as a percentage of revenue, was 40.3 percent for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared with 39.5 percent in the corresponding prior year period. The decreased operating expenses
were largely attributable to reduced costs related to the lower levels of activity in our Heliport operations.

was approximately $130,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing an increase of approximately $75,000 as
compared with the corresponding prior year period. Corporate SG A was approximately $362,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, representing an increase of approximately $126,000 as compared with the corresponding prior year period. 

OPERATING INCOME  

Operating income from
continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $572,329 and $1,369,758, respectively, as compared
to operating income of $641,636 and $1,528,381, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease on a year-over-year
basis was driven by lower levels of gross profit offset by lower SG A expenses. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization
was approximately $369,211 and $639,146 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $21,506 as compared to approximately $16,730 in the same period in 2015. 

Income Tax  

 Income tax expense
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $285,500 and $681,000, respectively, as compared to approximately $352,000
and $808,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2015. The decrease is attributable to lower pre-tax income in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 

Net Income Per Share  

Net income was $667,252
and $395,846 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net income is an outcome of the
factors described above. 

Basic and diluted net
income per share for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.02 and $0.01, respectively. 

12   

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

As of September 30,
2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,084,576 and a working capital surplus of $2,815,460. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we generated revenue from continuing operations of $10,872,366 and had net income from continuing operations before taxes
of $1,348,252. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows included net cash provided by operating activities of $1,915,570,
net cash used in investing activities of $40,781, and net cash used in financing activities of $204,874. 

On May 17, 2013, we
entered into a loan agreement with PNC Bank (the  PNC Loan Agreement ). The PNC Loan Agreement contained three components:
(i) a $2,500,000 non-revolving acquisition line of credit (the  PNC Acquisition Line ); (ii) a $1,150,000 working capital
line (the  PNC Working Capital Line ); and (iii) a $280,920 term loan (the  PNC Term Loan ). 

Proceeds of the PNC
Acquisition Line were able to be dispersed, based on parameters defined in the PNC Loan Agreement, until May 17, 2014 (the  Conversion
Date ). As of the Conversion Date, there was $1,350,000 outstanding under the PNC Acquisition Line. The payment terms provided
that 30 days following the Conversion Date, and continuing on the same day of each month thereafter, we are required to make equal
payments of principal over a 60 month period. Interest on the outstanding principal continues to accrue at a rate equal to one-month
LIBOR plus 275 basis points (3.26% as of September 30, 2016). As of September 30, 2016, there was $720,000 outstanding under the
PNC Acquisition Line. 

The PNC Working Capital
Line was to have been dispersed for working capital and general corporate purposes. Interest on outstanding principal accrued at
a rate equal to daily LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The PNC Working Capital Line expired on December 31, 2015, with $0 outstanding. 

The PNC Term Loan was
utilized to retire our previously outstanding miscellaneous debt of the same amount. Interest on outstanding principal accrued
at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 275 basis points and principal and interest payments were to be made over a thirty-four
month period. At December 31, 2015, all amounts under the PNC Term loan have been repaid. 

The Company is party to a Concession Agreement,
dated as of November 1, 2008, with the City of New York for the operation of the Downtown Manhattan Heliport (the  Concession
Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement, the Company must pay the greater of 18% of the first $5,000,000
in program year gross receipts and 25% of gross receipts in excess of $5 million or minimum annual guaranteed payments. The Company
paid the City of New York $1,200,000 in the first year of the term and minimum payments were scheduled to increase to approximately
$1,700,000 in the final year of Concession Agreement which, in accordance with an Amendment to the Concession Agreement dated July
13, 2016 (the  Amendment ) between the Company and the New York City Economic Development Corporation ( NYCEDC ),
expires on April 30, 2021. In addition to the extension of the base term, pursuant to the Amendment the City of New York has two
one year options to further extend the Concession Agreement. The Amendment also calls for certain reductions in air tour activity
at the Heliport as well as reductions to the Company s minimum annual guaranteed payments, which are described in greater
detail in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
on April 11, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred approximately $1,900,000 and
$2,100,000, respectively, in concession fees which are recorded in the cost of revenue. The Amendment was included as an exhibit
to the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, 

The air tour reductions discussed in the
Amendment are expected to negatively impact the Company s business and financial results as well as those of the Company s
management company Empire Aviation which, as previously disclosed, is owned by the children of Alvin Trenk, the Company s
CEO and a member of its Board of Directors.  The Company incurred management fees with Empire Aviation of approximately $2,706,000
and $2,711,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is recorded in administrative expenses.  

13   

The Company and Empire Aviation have also
contributed to the Helicopter Tourism and Jobs Council ( HTJC ), an association that lobbies on behalf of the helicopter
air tour industry, and which had engaged in discussions with the City of New York Mayor s office in connection with the Amendment. 
Mr. Trenk is also an active participant with HJTC, which is managed by his grandson. 

The Company entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2015, by and between the Company and Warren A. Peck (the  Stock Agreement ).
The details of the Stock Agreement are included in a Current Report filed with the SEC July 6, 2015 as well as in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 11, 2016. 

On September 30, 2015,
we and Mr. Peck executed a Closing Cash Agreement ( the  Closing Agreement ), which was filed with our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015. The Closing Agreement provided for Mr. Peck to assign over to the
Company title to an aircraft in order to defer the $250,000 cash consideration due at closing. As further described in the Closing
Agreement, we were to receive the $250,000 closing cash payment, plus other identified costs, when the aircraft was subsequently
sold. On June 13, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement (the  Sale Agreement ) with an unrelated third party
to acquire the aircraft subject to the Closing Agreement. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, we received a down-payment of
$30,000, which was credited against the $250,000 cash consideration owed by Mr. Peck. In addition, beginning in October 2016, the
Company will receive monthly payments of at least $28,000 to satisfy the remainder of the $250,000 cash consideration and $50,000
of the Note owed by Mr. Peck. The $220,000 remaining balance of closing cash consideration, plus receivables associated with the
Note, are reflected as a Note Receivable as of September 30, 2016.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In April 2014, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant
and Equipment (Topic 360)   Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity 
(ASU 2014-08) which requires entities to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhance convergence of the
FASB s and International Accounting Standard Board s (IASB) reporting requirements for discontinued operations so as
not to be overly complex or difficult to apply to stakeholders. Only those disposals of components of an entity that represent
a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity s operations and financial results will be reported
as discontinued operations in the financial statements. ASU 2014-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December
15, 2014 and interim periods thereafter. ASU 2014-08 will be effective for the Company s financial statements for fiscal
years beginning January 1, 2015. Based on the Company s evaluation of ASU 2014-08, the adoption of this statement on January
1, 2015 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.

by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing
(a   Third Party Claim  ), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice thereof. Such notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature of such action or claim, and include copies of any written complaint, summons,
correspondence or other communication from the party asserting the claim or initiating the action. 

As to any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations below, be entitled assume and thereafter control the defense of
such Indemnity Claim. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, if the claim which
the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control (i) seeks non-monetary relief, (ii) involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations,
(iii) involves a claim to which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination would be materially detrimental
to or injure the Indemnified Party s reputation or future business prospects, or (iv) involves a claim which, upon petition
by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute
or defend. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled, together with the Indemnifying Party, to participate in the defense, compromise
or settlement of any such matter through the Indemnifying Party s own attorneys and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party
shall provide such cooperation and such access to its books, records and properties as the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
request with respect to such matters and the parties hereto agree to render each other such assistance as they may reasonably require
of each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense thereof. An Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement of
any claims, other than claims strictly for monetary damages as to which the Indemnifying Party agrees to be responsible and which
expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such claim, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it
shall not be deemed to be unreasonable to withhold consent to a settlement involving injunctive or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or its assets, employees or business. 

8.4.        Payment . 
After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration
of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or Buyer and Sellers shall have reached
an agreement, in each case with respect to an indemnifiable claim hereunder, Buyer shall forward to Sellers notice of any sums
due and owing by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and Sellers shall pay all of such remaining
sums so due and owing to Buyers by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) business days after the date of
such notice; provided, however, that Buyer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to set-off any such amounts in accordance
with  Section 2.3 . 

8.5.        Purchase
Price Adjustments .  Amounts paid to or on behalf of Buyer Parties as indemnification shall be treated as adjustments to
the Purchase Price. 

8.6.        Survival .

survive the Closing. 

8.7.        Cumulative
