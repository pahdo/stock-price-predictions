1   Organization and History    

T-Rex
Oil, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in Colorado on September 2, 2014. Rancher Energy Corp was incorporated
in Nevada on February 2, 2004. Effective October 20, 2014, T-Rex Oil, Inc. and Rancher Energy Corp were merged under the laws
of the State of Colorado and T-Rex Oil, Inc. became the surviving entity.  

The
Company is currently engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas prospects in the Rocky Mountain region
of Wyoming.  

Western
Interior Acquisition   

On
February 24, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Western Interior Oil   Gas Corporation, a Wyoming
private oil and natural gas company ( Western Interior ) and the shareholders of Western Interior. Under the Share
Exchange Agreement the Company exchanged 7,465,168 shares of its restricted common stock for 170,878 shares of the issued and
outstanding common stock of Western Interior thereby owning 83% of Western Interior. The acquisition was closed on March 27, 2014
and became effective March 31, 2015. On March 31, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement
whereby the Company assumed certain repurchase agreements between Schwaben Kapital GmbH, Western Interior and its dissident shareholders
and as a result acquired the remaining 17% of Western Interior. As part of these agreements, the Company assumed certain promissory
notes issued to the dissenting shareholders in the total amount of $1,770,047 that were secured by Western Interior assets. As
a result, Western Interior became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. See Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   Principles of Consolidation.  

Cole
Creek    

On
January 15, 2016, T-Rex Oil LLC #3 entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Blue Tip Energy Wyoming, Inc. and Cole Creek
Recompletions LLC and acquired approximately 82% of the working interest in certain leases located in the state of Wyoming known
as the Cole Creek properties in exchange for $1,200,000 in cash plus the assumption of liabilities in the amount of $833,382 for
a total purchase price of $2,033,382. On April 20, 2016, the T-Rex Oil LLC #3 entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with
Black Hills Exploration   Production, Inc. and acquired the remaining approximately 18% working interest in the Cole Creek
properties in exchange for $250,000 in cash plus the assumption of liabilities in the amount of $182,938 for a total purchase
price of $432,938. These leases are proved developed and undeveloped leaseholds and include producing crude oil wells totaling
approximately 13,328 gross acres. See Note 2   Principles of Consolidation.  

Nexfuels
Spin Off   

On
July 11, 2016, Nexfuels, Inc. ( Nexfuels ), as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the State of Colorado.
Nexfuels was created to develop the Company s Carbon Dioxide Recovery Project. The Carbon Dioxide Recovery Project ( the
Project ) is focused on the development of exhaust stack supplies of carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery. The
project involves the development, build out and operation of a commercial scale carbon capture systems on existing coal fueled
electric power plants in the United States, specifically in Wyoming.  

The
Company s Board of Directors determined that to focus and better implement these strategies necessary to financing and build
the Project, the Board of Directors approved the spin-off of Nexfuels in August 2016.  

Shareholders
of T-Rex, as of the Record Date of August 19, 2016, will receive one share of Nexfuels common stock for every two shares (2) of
T-Rex common stock owned. The stock dividend will be based upon 17,097,622shares of T-Rex common stock that were issued and outstanding
as of the Record Date.  

As
part of the spin-off of Nexfuels, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Donald Walford and a director
of the Company Mr. Sears were appointed to the Board of Directors of Nexfuels.

  Notes
To The Consolidated Financial Statements  

  September
30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

On
August 19, 2016, the Company assigned to Nexfuels the following assets:  

1.  
      The
    idea, concept and plan to capture and sell CO2 generated by the Dave Johnston power plant located in Converse County, Wyoming
    and/or any other power plants owned by PacifiCorp.   

2.  
      The Memorandum
                                         of Understanding ( MOU ) by and between T-Rex and PacifiCorp Energy the owner/operator
                                         of the power plant. 

3.  
      The
    existing contract by and between Sargent Lundy LLC to perform the feasibility study.   

4.  
      Any
    and all other valid and subsisting contracts, agreement, and instruments, rights or other interest that the Company may have
    in the Project.   

5.  
      All
    valid and subsisting easements, permits, licenses, servitudes, rights of way and other surface rights that directly relate
    to or are otherwise directly applicable to the Project.   

An analysis of the items assigned to Nexfuels
by the Company showed that the Company in accordance with its accounting policies had not capitalized none of the direct or indirect
costs associated with the MOUs, the feasibility study or any of the other interests in the project. As such, the Company did not
recognize a gain or loss in connection with the Nexfuels spin-off. 

Note
2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated statement of operations and cash
flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 include the accounts of Terex Energy Corporation, T-Rex Oil, Inc., Western Interior
Oil and Gas Corporation and T-Rex Oil LLC #3. All intercompany balances have been eliminated during consolidation.  

The
Company owns a 14.29% equity interest in T-Rex Oil, LLC #3, the remaining 85.71% is held by a director and shareholder of the
Company. The Company has identified T-Rex Oil LLC #3 as a Variable Interest Entity (VIE). We hold current rights that gives us
the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance convened with
provisions that give us the right to receive potentially significant benefits. As a result, we consolidate the accounts of T-Rex
Oil, LLC #3, eliminating all intercompany balances during consolidation.  

We
continuously evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in T-Rex Oil LLC#3. Where we are a general partner, we
consider substantive removal rights held by other partners in determining if we hold a controlling financial interest. We reevaluate
whether we have a controlling financial interest in these entities when our voting or substantive participating rights change.  

Use
of Estimates in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the fair
value of assets and liabilities, oil and natural gas reserves, income taxes and the valuation allowances related to deferred tax
assets, asset retirement obligations and contingencies.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
and cash equivalents include demand deposits and money market funds carried at cost which approximates fair value. The Company
maintains its cash in institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), although such deposits
are in excess of the insurance coverage. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have cash deposits in excess of FDIC insured
limits.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk    

The
Company s producing properties are primarily located in Wyoming and the oil and gas production is sold to various purchasers
based on market index prices. The risk of non-payment by these purchasers is considered minimal and the Company does not generally
obtain collateral for sales. The Company continually monitors the credit standing of the primary purchasers.  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, we sold oil from our fields to two different purchasers, accounted for 55.19% of our
sales, while the other accounted for 44.81%.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable are stated at their cost less any allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on
the management s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable.
If there is deterioration in a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults are higher than the historical experience,
the management s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be adversely affected. Based on the
management s assessment, there is no reserve recorded at September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Oil
and Gas Producing Activities   

The
Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities. Under this method, the costs of productive
exploratory wells, all development wells, related asset retirement obligation assets, and productive leases are capitalized and
amortized, principally by field, on a units-of-production basis over the life of the remaining proved reserves. Exploration costs,
including personnel costs, geological and geophysical expenses, and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense
as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not
to have found reserves in commercial quantities. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost
recovery, and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the units-of-production amortization
rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties. There were capitalized costs of $11,754,817 and
$11,368,626 at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  

Unproved
oil and gas properties are assessed annually to determine whether they have been impaired by the drilling of dry holes on or near
the related acreage or other circumstances, which may indicate a decline in value. When impairment occurs, a loss is recognized.
When leases for unproved properties expire, the costs thereof, net of any related allowance for impairment, is removed from the
accounts and charged to expense. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no impairment to unproved
properties. The sale of a partial interest in an unproved property is accounted for as a recovery of cost when substantial uncertainty
exists as to the ultimate recovery of the cost applicable to the interest retained. A gain on the sale is recognized to the extent
that the sales price exceeds the carrying amount of the unproved property. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of
unproved properties. There were capitalized costs of $4,761,535 and $4,745,917 at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.

Costs
associated with development wells that are unevaluated or are waiting on access to transportation or processing facilities are
reclassified into developmental wells-in-progress ( WIP ). These costs are not put into a depletable field basis until
the wells are fully evaluated or access is gained to transportation and processing facilities. Costs associated with WIP are included
in the cash flows from investing as part of investment in oil and gas properties. At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, no
capitalized development costs were included in WIP.  

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the units-of-production method based on proved
reserves and estimated salvage values. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense on oil and gas properties in the amount of $74,775 and $429,899, respectively ($39,652 and
$302,851 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively).  

The
Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline
in the recoverability of its carrying value may have occurred. It estimates the undiscounted future net cash flows of its oil
and natural gas properties and compares such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas
properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value. There was no impairment
to prove properties for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Other
Property and Equipment   

Other
property and equipment, such as computer hardware and software, are recorded at cost. Costs of renewals and improvements that
substantially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed when incurred.
When other property and equipment is sold or retired, the capitalized costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
their respective accounts. Depreciation expense of other property and equipment for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $18,693 and $35,681, respectively ($8,409 and $723 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively).  

Asset
Retirement Obligations   

The
Company records estimated future asset retirement obligations ( ARO ) related to its oil and gas properties. The Company
records the estimated fair value of a liability for ARO in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in
the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The increased carrying value is depleted using the units-of-production method,
and the discounted liability is increased through accretion over the remaining life of the respective oil and gas properties.  

The
estimated liability is based on historical industry experience in abandoning wells, including estimated economic lives, external
estimates as to the cost to abandon the wells in the future, and federal and state regulatory requirements. The Company s
liability is discounted using management s best estimate of its credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability
could occur due to changes in estimated abandonment costs, changes in well economic lives, or if federal or state regulators enact
new requirements regarding the abandonment of wells.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

In
accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, as set forth in Topic
360 of the ASC, the Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its non-oil and gas long-lived assets when events
occur that indicate an impairment in value may exist. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted
future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If this occurs, an impairment loss is recognized for the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is realized or realizable and earned when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, the price to the buyer
is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For goods, this is the point at which title and risk of loss
is transferred and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. Revenues for services are recorded
when the services have been provided. Revenue that does not meet these criteria is deferred until the criteria are met.  

Other
Comprehensive Loss   

The
Company has no material components of other comprehensive loss and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss for the
period.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the accounting bases and the tax bases of the Company s
assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.  

The Company s deferred income taxes
include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax
assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred income tax asset will not be realized.  As a
result of this analysis, the deferred tax asset in the amount of $4,583,216 has been fully reserved at September 30, 2016.  

The
Company has adopted ASC guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. This guidance clarifies the accounting
for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax position is required to meet before being recognized
in the consolidated financial statements and applies to all income tax positions. Each income tax position is assessed using a
two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be
sustained, based upon technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the income tax position is expected to
meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded in the consolidated financial statements equals the largest amount
that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon its ultimate settlement. At September 30, 2016, there were no uncertain tax
positions that required accrual.  

Business
Combination   

The
Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with guidance found in ASC 805, Business Combinations. The guidance requires consideration
given, including contingent consideration, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be valued at their fair values at the date
of acquisition. The guidance further provides that acquisition costs will generally be expenses as incurred and changes in deferred
tax asset valuations and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense.

ASC
805 requires that any excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles and
liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill and any excess of fair value of acquired net assets, including identifiable intangible
assets over the acquisition consideration results in a gain from bargain purchase. Prior to recording a gain, the acquiring entity
must reassess whether ass acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re-measurements
to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been properly valued.  

Net
Loss per Share   

Basic
net loss per common share of stock is calculated by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during each period.  

Diluted
net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, including
the effect of other dilutive securities. The Company s potentially dilutive securities consist of in-the-money outstanding
options and warrants to purchase the Company s common stock. Diluted net loss per common share does not give effect to dilutive
securities as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  

The
treasury stock method is used to measure the dilutive impact of stock options and warrants. The following table details the weighted-average
dilutive and anti-dilutive securities related to stock options and warrants for the periods presented:  

Equity
Based Payments   

The
Company recognizes compensation cost for equity based awards based on estimated fair value of the award and records capitalized

Beneficial
Conversion Feature and Deemed Dividend Related to Series A Shares   

Pursuant to ASC 470-20, when the $558,171
of convertible Series A Shares of preferred stock were issued at a discount from the if-converted $682,989 fair value as of the
issuance date, the Company recognized this difference between the fair value per share of its common stock and the conversion
price, multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion. This total Beneficial Conversion Feature of $124,818 will
be recorded as additional paid-in-capital for common shares. The offsetting amount will be amortizable over the period from the
issue date to the first conversion date or 9 months. Therefore, since the 409,019 Series A Shares of preferred stock are convertible
between July and December of 2016, a deemed dividend of $37,805 to the Series A Shares of preferred stock has been recorded during
the six months ended September 30, 2016 $56,988 in its statement of operations and cash flows. As the Company is in an accumulated
deficit position, the deemed dividend of $56,988 has been charged against additional paid-in-capital for common shares as there
being no retained earnings from which to declare a dividend.

As
part of its ongoing business, the Company has not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs),
which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow

in any unconsolidated SPE transactions.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic915)   Elimination of Certain Financial
Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation . This standard
update is to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements
for development stage entities, and as a result removes all incremental financial reporting requirements. This standard update
also eliminates an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity
is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of the investment equity that is at risk. ASU 2014-10 is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities
are allowed to apply the guidance early for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity s financial
statements have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company adopted these standards and they did not have
a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued  Update No. 2014-15 - Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern  that requires
management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to
continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the entity s financial statements are issued, or within
one year after the date that the entity s financial statements are available to be issued, and to provide disclosures when
certain criteria are met. This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance
and assessing its impact, but does not currently believe it will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial
statements or disclosures.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 is part of the FASB s initiative to reduce the complexity in accounting standards. ASU
2015-17 requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as non-current in a classified balance sheet.
The amendments in this ASU simplify current guidance in ASC 740-10-45-4 that requires separate presentation of deferred tax assets
and liabilities as current and non-current in a classified balance sheet based on the classification of the related asset or liability.
ASU 2015-17 is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company
adopted this ASU as of March 31, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets
as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize all leases,
including operating leases, on the balance sheet as a lease asset or lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease.
ASU 2016-02 also requires additional disclosures regarding leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim periods
and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early application is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining
the method of adoption and the impact this guidance will have on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15
clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows to reduce diversity
in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

3   Going Concern and Managements  Plan   

The Company s consolidated financial
statements for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company reported
a net loss of $2,035,883 and $1,490,698 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($1,282,687 and $799,746 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively), respectively, and an accumulated deficit of $28,792,856 as of September
30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $(1,918,915). 

The
future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to attract additional capital and ultimately, upon its ability to develop
future profitable operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such financing, or that
it will attain positive cash flow from operations. Management believes that actions presently being taken to revise the Company s
operating and financial requirements provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  

Note
4   Fair Value Measurements   

The
Company applies the authoritative guidance applicable to all financial assets and liabilities required to be measured and reported
on a fair value basis, as well as to non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including
impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets and AROs initially measured at fair value. The fair value
of an asset or liability is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs
and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants
would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable
input are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability
based on the information available in the circumstances.  

Financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities are classified within the valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers in and out of the fair value
hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period in which the event or change in circumstances caused the transfer. The Company
has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed below in all periods presented. The hierarchy is organized into three
levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:  

Level
1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; or  

Level
2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable;
or  

Level
3: Unobservable pricing inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its
own assumptions.

The
following table presents the Company s non-financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis at September 30, 2016 by level within the fair value hierarchy:  

Effective
January 1, 2016, the Company acquired approximately 82% of the working interest in certain leases located in the state of Wyoming
known as the Cole Creek properties and recorded the oil and gas properties at a fair value of $2,033,382. Thus, due to the significance
of this event, the oil and gas properties were tested under ASC 360 as to its recoverability. Therefore, the oil and gas properties
were recorded at fair value if impairment is required under the accounting guidance. The Company uses Level 2 inputs and the income
valuation techniques of undiscounted oil and gas future net cash flows to measure the fair value of the oil and gas properties
and thus the model forecast including discount rates and commodity prices were selected by the independent engineers of Netherland,
Sewell   Associates, Inc. As such, there was an impairment to the oil and gas properties during the year ended March 31, 2016,
the amount of $1,103,144.  

The
Company in December 2014 entered into put agreements with the members of T-Rex #1 whereby the Company granted a right to put the
purchase of their interest of T-Rex #1 in the amount of $425,000 back to the Company at an exercise price of $2.00 per share or
a total of 212,500 shares of the Company s common stock. In August 2016, the members exercised the put at $1.00 per share
and a total of 425,000 shares of restricted common stock were issued. As a result, the Company became the sole equity holder in
LLC#1, a review of LLC#1 s operational status has lead management to take an immediate impairment on the value of the equity
of $425,000 which has been expensed as an asset impairment charge at September 30, 2016.  

The
following table presents the Company s non-financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis at September 30, 2016 by level within the fair value hierarchy:  

Fair
value in the initial recognition of other equipment is determined based on the quoted fair value of the vehicle using inputs from
valuation techniques used by industry participants. Accordingly, the fair value is based on observable pricing inputs and is considered
a Level 2 value measurement. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there was no impairment.

the parties agreed the amount owed on such promissory note by the Company would be reduced from $768,715 to $393,795 and the difference
of $374,920 be considered a reduction in the purchase price by the Company of the 14,368 shares of Western Interior common stock.
In addition, the $393,795 was paid in full effective August 1, 2015 by the transfer to the note holder of certain oil and gas
properties owned by Western Interior which resulted in the Company reporting a gain on disposal of assets in the amount of $44,100.

Series
A Preferred Shares   

On
October 28, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to designate a class of preferred stock as the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.  

The
Amendment sets aside 5,000,000 shares of the authorized 50,000,000 shares of the Company s $0.001 par value preferred stock
as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ( the Series A Shares. ) The Series A Shares are convertible at the option
of the Holder into common shares of the Company s stock 9 months after the date of issuance. Further, the Series A Shares
have a conversion price based upon 80% of the 10 day average of the Company s closing market price at the time of conversion.  

In
October 2015, the Company commenced a private placement financing of $7,000,000 in Units, a Unit consisting of one share of its
Series A Shares and an Unit Warrant. The Unit Warrant has an exercise price of $3.00 per share and a term of 3 years. The Unit
Warrant is exercisable 9 months after issuance and is callable by the Company upon the Company s common stock closing at
a market price of $5.00 or above for a period of 10 days.  

Pursuant to ASC 470-20, when the $558,171
of convertible Series A Shares of preferred stock were issued at a discount from the if-converted $682,989 fair value as of the
issuance date, the Company recognized this difference between the fair value per share of its common stock and the conversion
price, multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion. This total Beneficial Conversion Feature of $124,818 will
be recorded as additional paid-in-capital for common shares. The offsetting amount will be amortizable over the period from the
issue date to the first conversion date or 9 months. Therefore, since the 409,019 Series A Shares of preferred stock are convertible
between July and December of 2016, a deemed dividend of $56,988 to the Series A Shares of preferred stock has been recorded during
the six months ended September 30, 2016 in its statement of operations and cash flows. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit
position, the deemed dividend of $56,988 has been charged against additional paid-in-capital for common shares as there being
no retained earnings from which to declare a dividend. 

During
the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company received $818,038, including cash of $793,037, in exchange for the issuance of 409,019
shares of its Series A Preferred Stock and Unit Warrants exercisable for 419,019 shares of common stock.  

We
apply the guidance enumerated in ASC 480   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity   when determining the classification
and measurement of preferred shares. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments
and are measured at fair value. We classify conditionally redeemable preferred shares (if any), which includes preferred shares
that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of
uncertain events not solely within our control, as equity. At all other times, we classified our preferred shares in stockholders 
equity.  

We
have applied the guidance of ASC 470   Deb t  in accounting for the unit warrants and as such have valued the
Unit Warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which
the most significant are the stock price at the valuation date that was at a range of $1.10 to $1.50 per share as well as the
following assumptions:  

The
expected term of the Unit Warrants granted were estimated to be the contractual term. The expected volatility was based on an
average of the volatility disclosed based upon comparable companies who had similar expected option and warrant terms. The risk-free
rate was based on the one-year U.S. Treasury bond rate.  

As
a result, the Unit Warrants exercisable for 409,019 shares of our restricted common stock were valued at $135,049 and as such
$67,830 was credited to additional paid in capital during the year ended March 31, 2016.

Note
8   Equity Based Payments   

The
Company accounts for equity based payment accruals under authoritative guidance as set forth in the Topics of the ASC. The guidance
requires all equity based payments to employees and non-employees, including grants of employee and non-employee stock options
and warrants, to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based at their fair values.  

The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the option and warrant fair values. The option-pricing model requires a
number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the stock price at the valuation date that ranged from $0.01 to $3.50
per share as well as the following assumptions:  

The
expected term of the options and warrants granted were estimated to be the contractual term. The expected volatility was based
on an average of the volatility disclosed based upon comparable companies who had similar expected option and warrant terms. The
risk-free rate was based on the one-year U.S. Treasury bond rate.

Warrant   

During
May 2016, the Company issued a warrant exercisable for 350,000 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for business
development services pursuant to a Consulting Agreement. The warrant has a term of 3 years and an exercise price of $2.00 per
share.  

Using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the warrant was found to have a fair value of $207,200. Assumptions used in the pricing
were:  

As
the warrant was issued for services to be rendered under a 3 year Consulting Agreement, the Company is amortizing the warrant
over the life of the Consulting Agreement.  

2014
Stock Incentive Plan   

Effective
October 1, 2014, the Company s 2014 Stock Option and Award Plan (the  2014 Stock Incentive Plan ) was approved
by its Board of Directors. Under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors may grant options or purchase rights to
purchase common stock to officers, employees, and other persons who provide services to the Company or any related company. The
participants to whom awards are granted, the type of awards granted, the number of shares covered for each award, and the purchase
price, conditions and other terms of each award are determined by the Board of Directors, except that the term of the options
shall not exceed 10 years. A total of 2 million shares of the Company s common stock are subject to the 2014 Stock Incentive
Plan. The shares issued for the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan may be either treasury or authorized and unissued shares.  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options exercisable for a total of 1,480,000 shares of restricted
common stock to officers, directors and employees of the Company. The options are exercisable at a price based upon using a valuation
of the Company s common stock under 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and therefore management has determined that the exercise
price is $.25 per share at the date of the grant. It is management s intention to utilize an outside firm in the near future
to otherwise perform an independent valuation of the Company s common stock under 409A. The options have a life of 3 years.
Options exercisable for 853,333 shares granted to employees and directors are fully vested at September 30, 2016 where options
exercisable for 626,667 shares granted to officers, directors and employees have vesting rates over the remaining life of the
options.  

Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model,
the vested options at the date of grant have a fair value of $1,068,384. Significant assumptions used in the valuation are: 

The
Company is amortizing the vested options over a period of 3 years and therefore for the six and three months ended September 30,
2016, recognized an expense of $41,800 and $41,800, respectively.

         MANAGEMENT S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein.
In connection with, and because we desire to take advantage of, the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the following discussion and
elsewhere in this report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future
operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates
and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies,
many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These
uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in any forward looking statements made by, or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.   

Unless
the context requires otherwise, references in this document to  T-Rex Oil ,  we ,  our ,  us 
or the  Company  are to T-Rex Oil, Inc. and our subsidiaries.   

The
independent registered public accounting firm s report on the Company s financial statements as of March 31, 2016,
and for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, includes a  going concern  explanatory paragraph, that
describes substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.    

PLAN
OF OPERATIONS    

We
are an energy company, focused on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. We have acquired
oil and natural gas properties located in the western United States, mainly in the Rocky Mountain region. Our goal is to drill
and produce oil and gas cost effectively by concentrating our efforts in proven oil rich areas where we have in-house geologic
and operating experience.  

We
are focusing on the acquisition of proven properties that we believe can be economically enhanced in this current commodity price
environment. In certain market conditions, we believe there could be additional upside realized through the development of deeper
productive horizons, or applying tertiary recovery applications to these acquired fields.  

To
date, we have focused our activities in Eastern Wyoming along the Salt Creek/Big Muddy trend. Starting with the Salt Creek field
in Natrona County, following the Salt Creek/Big Muddy trend down to the South Glenrock field in Converse County, we believe there
are a series of analogous fields that could provide ideal targets for us to execute this business strategy.  

Our
acquisition strategy includes taking older wells that are shut in or have lower production results and applying new and existing
technologies to work-over and/or recomplete those wells so as to increase production and ultimate recovery. Technologies to be
deployed include 3-D seismic imaging to target undeveloped areas of the reservoir that contain remaining primary reserves and
horizontal drilling to increase recoveries, as well as secondary and tertiary recovery methods to increase produced reserves.  

Nexfuels
Spin-off   

On
July 11, 2016, Nexfuels, Inc. ( Nexfuels ), as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the State of Colorado.
Nexfuels was created to develop the Company s Carbon Dioxide Recovery Project. The Carbon Dioxide Recovery Project ( the
Project ) is focused on the development of exhaust stack supplies of carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery. The
project involves the development, build out and operation of a commercial scale carbon capture systems on existing coal fueled
electric power plants in the United States, specifically in Wyoming.  

The
Company s Board of Directors determined that to focus and better implement these strategies necessary to financing and build
the Project, the Board of Directors approved the spin-off of Nexfuels in August 2016.  

Shareholders
of T-Rex, as of the Record Date of August 19, 2016, will receive one share of Nexfuels common stock for every two shares (2) of
T-Rex common stock owned. The stock dividend will be based upon 17,097,622shares of T-Rex common stock that were issued and outstanding
as of the Record Date.  

As
part of the spin-off of Nexfuels, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Donald Walford and a director
of the Company Mr. Sears were appointed to the Board of Directors of Nexfuels.  

On
August 19, 2016, the Company assigned to Nexfuels the following assets:  

1.  
      The
    idea, concept and plan to capture and sell CO2 generated by the Dave Johnston power plant located in Converse County, Wyoming
    and/or any other power plants owned by PacifiCorp.   

2.  
      The Memorandum
                                         of Understanding ( MOU ) by and between T-Rex and PacifiCorp Energy the owner/operator
                                         of the power plant. 

3.  
      The
    existing contract by and between Sargent Lundy LLC to perform the feasibility study.   

4.  
      Any
    and all other valid and subsisting contracts, agreement, and instruments, rights or other interest that the Company may have
    in the Project.   

5.  
      All
    valid and subsisting easements, permits, licenses, servitudes, rights of way and other surface rights that directly relate
    to or are otherwise directly applicable to the Project.   

An analysis of the items assigned to Nexfuels
by the Company showed that the Company in accordance with its accounting policies had not capitalized none of the direct or indirect
costs associated with the MOUs, the feasibility study or any of the other interests in the project. As such, the Company did not
recognize a gain or loss in connection with the Nexfuels spin-off. 

Nexfuels
Warrant   

On October 15, 2016, Nexfuels issued a warrant
exercisable for 1,056,000 shares of the common stock of Nexfuels to the Company in return for accounting and staff services over
a six-month period ( Nexfuels Warrant ). The Nexfuels Warrant has an exercise price of $1.25 per share and an expiration
date of February 15, 2017. The Nexfuels Warrant is both assignable and transferable. The Company has valued the warrant at $45,000
or $7,500 per month for services. 

Promissory
Note and Stock Sale   

On
November 3, 2016, the Company in exchange for $300,000 cash issued a promissory note. The promissory note has an interest rate
of 12% per annum and a due date of January 31, 2017. The promissory note is convertible into shares of the Company s common
stock at $0.80 per share. In addition, the Company issued the holder of the promissory note 75,000 shares of its restricted common
stock and agreed to transfer to the holder 50,000 warrants from Nexfuels warrant held by the Company.  

We
will require substantial additional capital to support our existing and proposed future operations. We have no committed source
for any additional funds as of the date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the
event funds cannot be raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, may never achieve sales or royalty
income and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS    

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

Overview. During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recognized a net loss of $1,282,687 compared to a net loss of $830,476 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase of $452,208 is primarily the result of an increase in oil sales offset by an increase in operational activities.
Discussions of individually significant line items follow: 

Revenues:  During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recognized revenues of $397,012 compared to $1124,183 during the three months ended September
30, 2015. Management expects to see continued increases in its production numbers as it begins to institute re-work plans during
the year and from the Company s purchase of outstanding working interests in these properties during April 2016. 

Operating Expenses:  During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had an increase of $707,696 in total operating expenses as a result of the following: 

An increase in costs of $179,998 related to
its oil and gas operational activities as a result of its take over of the operations of the T-Rex Oil LLC#3 properties. General
and administrative expenses increased by $336,323 primarily as a result of increases in staffing and costs associated with reporting
requirements. Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion decreased by $272,870 and production taxes increased by $23,953.
Amortization of $41,800 in connection with the issuance of 1,480,000 options to officers, directors and employees was also recognized
during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The
Company is the manager of T-Rex Oil LLC #1 ( T-Rex #1 ) that was formed during December 2014 for the purpose of drilling
and producing oil and gas wells in western Nebraska. The Company in December 2014 entered into put agreements with the members
of T-Rex #1 whereby the Company granted a right to put the purchase of their interest of T-Rex #1 in the amount of $425,000 back
to the Company at an exercise price of $2.00 per share or a total of 212,500 shares of the Company s common stock.  

In
August 2016, the members exercised the put at $1.00 per share and a total of 425,000 shares of restricted common stock were issued.
As a result, the Company became the sole equity holder in LLC#1, a review of LLC#1 s operational status has lead management
to take an immediate impairment on the value of the equity of $425,000 which has been expensed as an asset impairment charge.  

For
the Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

Overview. During the six months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recognized a net loss of $2,035,883 compared to a net loss of $1,490,698 for the six months ended September
30, 2015. The increase of $545,185 is primarily the result of an increase in oil sales offset by an increase in operational activities.
Discussions of individually significant line items follow: 

Revenues:
 During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized revenues of $717,024 compared to $288,094 during the
six months ended September 30, 2015. Management expects to see continued increases in its production numbers as it begins to institute
re-work plans during the year and from the Company s purchase of outstanding working interests in these properties during
April 2016.  

Operating Expenses:  During the six
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had an increase of $968,290 in total operating expenses as a result of the following: 

An
increase in costs of $968,289 related to its oil and gas operational activities as a result of its take over of the operations
of the T-Rex Oil LLC#3 properties. General and administrative expenses increased by $420,923 primarily as a result of increases
in staffing and costs associated with reporting requirements. Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion decreased by
$372,110 and production taxes increased by $60,746 and amortization of $41,800, in connection with the issuance of 1,480,000 options
to officers, directors and employees.  

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company took a $425,000 asset impairment charge on the equity of T-Rex #1, as discussed
above.  

LIQUIDITY    

We have incurred a net loss of $2,035,883
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and have had a limited operating history. 

During the six months ended September 30,
2016, the Company as part of a private placement sold 99,378 shares of its restricted common stock for $74,613 in cash and 378,510
shares for $567,164 in cash. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 50,000 shares or restricted common
stock in connection with the cash exercise of $5,000 and 50,000 shares in connection with the exercise of an option as payment
of debt of $2,000. Further, during the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 50,000 shares for services valued
at $89,500 and $70,579 in equity compensation expense. 

On
November 3, 2016, the Company in exchange for $300,000 cash issued a promissory note. The promissory note has an interest rate
of 12% per annum and a due date of January 31, 2017. The promissory note is convertible into shares of the Company s common
stock at $0.80 per share. In addition, the Company issued the holder of the promissory note 75,000 shares of its restricted common
stock and agreed to transfer to the holder 50,000 warrants from Nexfuels warrant held by the Company.  

The
Company will need substantial additional capital to support its proposed future energy operations. While we recognize revenues
from our oil operations, they are not sufficient to support operations. The Company has no committed source for any funds, but
as of September 30, 2016, we have $151,390 in cash. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In
the event funds cannot be raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and we may never achieve sales
sufficient to support our operations.  

Decisions
regarding future participation in oil and gas development or geophysical studies or other activities will be made on a case-by-case
basis. We may, in any particular case, decide to participate or decline participation. If participating, we may pay our proportionate
share of costs to maintain our proportionate interest through cash flow or debt or equity financing. If participation is declined,
we may elect to farmout, non-consent, sell or otherwise negotiate a method of cost sharing in order to maintain some continuing
interest in the prospect.  

The
Company used cash flows in operations of $926,296 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 that was adjusted by non-cash
items including: depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion of $93,470, equity based compensation of $28,778, common
stock issued for services of $89,500 and an asset impairment of $425,000.  

The
Company used cash flows in investing activities of $268,498 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 that was primarily
comprised of: additions to oil and gas properties of $268,498 and additions to other assets of $38.  

The
Company was provided cash flows from financing activities of $918,018 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 through $646,777
from the sale of restricted common stock, the cash exercise of options and the cash contribution of a director and shareholder
of $200,000 and net proceeds from notes payable of $71,241.  

Promissory
Notes    

The
Company during the year ended March 31, 2016 paid $341,405 in principal towards the repayment of promissory notes relative to
the repurchase of 18,717 shares of Western Interior common stock owned by dissident shareholders as part of agreements effective
March 31, 2015 to repurchase a total of 33,085 shares of Western Interior common stock. The Company at September 30, 2016 owes
a balance in the amount of $488,298 on one of the promissory notes plus accrued interest of $21,351 with the remaining three promissory
notes being paid in full.  

On
August 1, 2015, the Company, relative to the repurchase by the Company on March 31, 2015 of the remaining 14,368 shares of Western
Interior common stock entered into an agreement with the note holder to settle the amount owed under the promissory note. As such,
the parties agreed the amount owed on such promissory note by the Company would be reduced from $768,715 to $393,795 and the difference
of $374,920 be considered a reduction in the purchase price by the Company of the 14,368 shares of Western Interior common stock.
In addition, the $393,795 was paid in full effective August 1, 2015 by the transfer to the note holder of certain oil and gas
properties owned by Western Interior which resulted in the Company reporting a gain on disposal of assets in the amount of $44,100.

Line-of-Credit   

The
Company has a line-of-credit with a bank in the amount of $350,000 collateralized by certain oil and gas properties of the Company.
The line-of-credit matures in November 2016. Annual interest is at prime plus 2.50% with a floor of 7%). The Company owes $121,103
on the line-of-credit at September 30, 2016.  

Short
Term   

On
a short-term basis, we have not generated revenues sufficient to cover operations. Based on prior history, we will continue to
have insufficient revenue to satisfy current and recurring liabilities as the Company continues exploration activities.  

Capital
Resources   

The
Company has only equity as its capital resource.  

We
have no material commitments for capital expenditures within the next year; however, our plans to develop our existing oil properties
are capital intensive and capital will be needed to pay for participation, investigation, exploration, acquisition and working
capital.  

Need
for Additional Financing    

We
do not have capital sufficient to meet our cash needs. The Company will have to seek loans or equity placements to cover such
cash needs. Recompletions and re-works on existing wells, along with exploration activities will spur the need for additional
financing and are likely to increase such needs.  

No
commitments to provide additional funds have been made by the Company s management or other shareholders. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to us to allow us to cover the Company s expenses as they
may be incurred.  

The
Company will need substantial additional capital to support its proposed future energy operations. We have insufficient revenues
to cover our corporate costs. The Company has  no  committed source for any funds as of the date hereof. No representation
is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised when needed, we may not be able to carry
out our business plan, may never achieve sufficient sales or royalty income and could fail in business as a result of lack of
capital.  

Decisions
regarding future participation in exploration wells or geophysical studies or other activities will be made on a case-by-case
basis. The Company may, in any particular case, decide to participate or decline participation. If participating, we may pay the
proportionate share of costs to maintain the Company s proportionate interest through cash flow or debt or equity financing.
If participation is declined, the Company may elect to farmout, non-consent, sell or otherwise negotiate a method of cost sharing
in order to maintain some continuing interest in the prospect.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no material off-balance sheet arrangements nor do we have any unconsolidated subsidiaries.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Critical
accounting policies and estimates are provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, in
Item 7   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8  
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Additional disclosures are provided in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited) which are included in Item 1   Consolidated Financial Statements to this Quarterly Report.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk    

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures    

We
conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Acting Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We identified multiple material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting and, as a result of this material weakness, we concluded as of June 30, 2016,
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework   

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that result in more than a remote likelihood
that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of September 30,
2016 and as determined in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company identified the following material weakness:  

The
Company did not adequately segregate the duties of different personnel within our accounting department due to an insufficient
complement of staff and inadequate management oversight.   

We
have limited accounting personnel with sufficient expertise in generally accepted accounting principles to enable effective segregation
of duties with respect to recording journal entries and to allow for appropriate monitoring of financial reporting matters and
internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, the Acting Chief Accounting Officer has involvement in the creation and
review of journal entries and note disclosures without adequate independent review and authorization. This control deficiency
is pervasive in nature and impacts all significant accounts. This control deficiency also affects the financial reporting process
including financial statement preparation and the related note disclosures. Other significant control deficiencies at this time
are lack of independent review and approval of journal entries before they are entered into the general ledger, not effectively
implementing comprehensive entity-level controls, and the Company has not implemented procedures for timely review and approval
of bank reconciliations.  

As
a result of the aforementioned material weakness, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2016 was not effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

Debt
Litigation   

On
October 26, 2016, a former officer and director of the Company filed suit with the District Court, City and County of Denver for
payment of the $50,000 borrowed on January 14, 2016. The Company, in exchange for $50,000 issued a secured promissory note including
interest at the rate of 5% per annum with accrued and unpaid interest and principal due at September 30, 2016. The promissory
note is collateralized by certain oil and gas properties located in the State of Wyoming. The Holder had the right at any time
prior to payment of the promissory note to elect to convert all or any portion of the promissory notes, including accrued interest,
into common shares of the Company at a price determined by the average ten consecutive day trading closing price less 30%. The
Company, requested an extension of the due date of the promissory note. The Company at September 30, 2016 owes $50,000 on the
promissory note plus accrued interest of $1,971.  

BMO
Holdings Litigation   

On
October 31, 2016, BMO Holding, LLC ( BMO Holding ) filed suit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, New York County, alleging a breach of alleged contract resulting from certain business negotiations with the Company
revolving around the purchase of oil and gas properties in Wyoming by an affiliated entity of BMO Holding. The suit seeks the
fulfillment of the alleged contract and unspecified damages to be determined by jury.  

We
have not accrued any liability because of the strength of our defenses and a range of possible loss, if any, cannot be determined
at this early stage of the litigation. We intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously, but the outcome of this matter is inherently
uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS  

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information
required by this Item. However, our current risk factors are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March
31, 2016, which risk factors are incorporated herein by this reference.  

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   

During
the period of July 1, 2016 through August 31, 2016, the Company made the following issuances of its equity securities.  

Exemption
from Registration Claimed   

(1)  
      The
    above issuances by the Company of its unregistered securities were made by the Company in reliance upon Rule 506 of Regulation
    D and Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  1933 Act ). The parties that purchased the
    unregistered securities was known to the Company and its management, through pre-existing business relationships and as a
    long standing business associate. The purchasers were provided access to all material information, which they requested, and
    all information necessary to verify such information and was afforded access to management of the Company in connection with
    their purchase. The purchasers of the unregistered securities acquired such security for investment and not with a view toward
    distribution, acknowledging such intent to the Company. The certificate or agreement representing such securities that was
    issued contained a restrictive legend, prohibiting further transfer of the certificate or agreement representing such security,
    without such security either being first registered or otherwise exempt from registration in any further resale or disposition.
