1. 
    Organization, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
     Organization 
  Unless indicated otherwise, the terms  our,   we,   us  and similar language refer to Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. together with its subsidiaries. We are a Delaware limited partnership and our limited partner units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol  MMP.  Magellan GP, LLC, a wholly-owned Delaware limited liability company, serves as our general partner. 
    
  Description of Business 
    
  We are principally engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and crude oil.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our asset portfolio, including the assets of our joint ventures, consisted of: 

our refined products segment, comprised of our   9,700  -mile refined products pipeline system with   53   terminals as well as   26   independent terminals not connected to our pipeline system and our   1,100  -mile ammonia pipeline system;  

our crude oil segment, comprised of approximately   2,100   miles of crude oil pipelines and storage facilities with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately   23 million   barrels, of which approximately   15 million   barrels are used for leased storage; and 

our marine storage segment, consisting of   five   marine terminals located along coastal waterways with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately   26 million   barrels. 
       
  Terminology common in our industry includes the following terms, which describe products that we transport, store and distribute through our pipelines and terminals: 

refined products   are the output from refineries and are primarily used as fuels by consumers. Refined products include gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, kerosene and heating oil.  Collectively, diesel fuel and heating oil are referred to as distillates;  

liquefied petroleum gases, or LPGs,   are produced as by-products of the crude oil refining process and in connection with natural gas production. LPGs include butane and propane; 

blendstocks   are blended with refined products to change or enhance their characteristics such as increasing a gasoline s octane or oxygen content. Blendstocks include alkylates, oxygenates and natural gasoline; 

heavy oils and feedstocks   are used as burner fuels or feedstocks for further processing by refineries and petrochemical facilities. Heavy oils and feedstocks include No. 6 fuel oil and vacuum gas oil; 

crude oil and condensate   are used as feedstocks by refineries and petrochemical facilities; 

biofuels  , such as ethanol and biodiesel, are increasingly required by government mandates; and 

ammonia   is primarily used as a nitrogen fertilizer. 
       
  Except for ammonia, we use the term   petroleum products   to describe any, or a combination, of the above-noted products.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Basis of Presentation 
    
  In the opinion of management, our accompanying consolidated financial statements which are unaudited, except for the consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , which is derived from our audited financial statements, include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , the results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  .  The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016 for several reasons.  Profits from our butane blending activities are realized largely during the first and fourth quarters of each year.  Additionally, gasoline demand, which drives transportation volumes and revenues on our pipeline systems, generally trends higher during the summer driving months.  Further, the volatility of commodity prices impacts the profits from our commodity activities and, to a lesser extent, the volume of petroleum products we transport on our pipelines. 
    
  Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the financial statements in this report do not include all of the information and notes normally included with financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that exist at the date of our consolidated financial statements, as well as their impact on the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which is part of the FASB s initiative to simplify accounting standards. The guidance requires an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur, and allows equity classification for awards where employees elect to withhold up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions.  The new standard also requires cash paid by employers when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes to be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. 
    
  We elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2016, and this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In conjunction with our adoption of this new accounting standard, we have elected to account for equity-based compensation forfeitures as they occur. Additionally, and consistent with our prior accounting policy, we continue to show cash paid when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes as a financing activity in our statements of cash flows.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).    This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases.  The new accounting model for lessors remains largely the same, although some changes have been made to align it with the new lessee model and the new revenue recognition guidance.  This update also requires companies to include additional disclosures regarding their lessee and lessor agreements.  Public companies are required to adopt the  
  
    7 

     Table of Contents  

MAGELLAN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, L.P. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

standard for financial reporting periods that start after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which eliminates the industry-specific guidance in U.S. GAAP and produces a single, principles-based method for companies to report revenue in their financial statements.  This standard requires companies to make more estimates and use more judgment than under current guidance.  In addition, all companies must compile more extensive footnote disclosures about how the revenue numbers were derived.  This ASU requires full retrospective, modified retrospective or use of the cumulative effect method during the period of adoption.  In July 2015, the FASB extended the effective date of this standard from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our financial statements. 

2. 
    Product Sales Revenue 
     The amounts reported as product sales revenue on our consolidated statements of income include revenue from the physical sale of petroleum products and mark-to-market adjustments from New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) contracts.  See Note 8     Derivative Financial Instruments   for a discussion of our commodity hedging strategies and how our NYMEX contracts impact product sales revenue.  All of the petroleum products inventory we physically sell associated with our butane blending and fractionation activities, as well as the barrels from product gains we obtain from our operations, are reported as product sales revenue on our consolidated statements of income.  
  For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , product sales revenue included the following (in thousands):    

3. 
    Segment Disclosures 
       
  Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. Our segments are managed separately as each segment requires different marketing strategies and business knowledge. Management evaluates performance based on segment operating margin, which includes revenue from affiliates and external customers, operating expenses, cost of product sales and earnings of non-controlled entities.  
  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures used by management. Operating margin, which is presented in the following tables, is an important measure used by management to evaluate the economic performance of our core operations. Operating margin is not a GAAP measure, but the components of operating margin are computed using amounts that are determined in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, is included in the tables below. Operating profit includes depreciation and amortization expense and general and administrative ( G A ) expense that management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of our separate operating segments.

    50% 

In February 2016, we transferred our   50%   membership interest in Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC ( Osage ) to an affiliate of HollyFrontier Corporation.  In conjunction with this transaction, we entered into several commercial agreements with affiliates of HollyFrontier Corporation.  We recorded these commercial agreements as   $43.7 million   of intangible assets and   $8.3 million   of other receivables in our consolidated balance sheets. The intangible assets will be amortized over the   20  -year life of the contracts received.  The total gain recorded in 2016 was   $28.1 million  . 
    
  The management fees we have recognized from BridgeTex, Osage, Powder Springs, Saddlehorn and Texas Frontera are reported as affiliate management fee revenue on our consolidated statements of income.  In addition, we receive reimbursement from certain of our joint ventures for costs incurred during construction, which we included as reductions to costs and expenses on our consolidated statements of income.  These construction cost reimbursements totaled   $1.2 million   and   $2.7 million   during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  We recognized pipeline capacity lease revenue from BridgeTex of   $8.9 million   and   $8.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, and   $25.8 million   and   $26.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, which we included in transportation and terminals revenue on our consolidated statements of income.  
    
  We recognized throughput revenue from Double Eagle of   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, and   $2.6 million   and   $2.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, which we included in transportation and terminals revenue on our consolidated statements of income.  At   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively, we recognized a   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million   trade accounts receivable from Double Eagle.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $2.9 million  ,   $1.4 million   and   $0.5 million   of other receivables from Saddlehorn, BridgeTex and Powder Springs, respectively, related to the activities detailed above and miscellaneous cost reimbursements.  These receivables are reported in our balance sheets as other accounts receivable. 
    
  The financial results from Texas Frontera are included in our marine storage segment, the financial results from BridgeTex, Double Eagle, HoustonLink, Osage, Saddlehorn and Seabrook are included in our crude oil segment and the financial results from Powder Springs are included in our refined products segment, each as earnings/losses of non-controlled entities.

The carrying amount of our consolidated debt at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   was as follows (in thousands, except as otherwise noted): 

(1) 
    Weighted-average interest rate includes the amortization/accretion of discounts, premiums and gains/losses realized on historical cash flow and fair value hedges recognized as interest expense. 
       
           (2) 
    These borrowings were outstanding for only a portion of the   nine  -month period ending   September 30, 2016  .  The weighted-average interest rate for these borrowings was calculated based on the number of days the borrowings were outstanding during the noted period. 

All of the instruments detailed in the table above are senior indebtedness. 
    
  The face value of our debt at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   was   $3.4 billion   and   $4.3 billion  , respectively.  The difference between the face value and carrying value of our debt outstanding is the unamortized portion of terminated fair value hedges and the unamortized discounts and premiums on debt issuances.  Realized gains and losses on fair value hedges and note discounts and premiums are being amortized or accreted to the applicable notes over the respective lives of those notes.   
    
  2016 Debt Offering 
    
  In September 2016, we issued   $500.0 million   of our   4.25%   notes due 2046 in an underwritten public offering.  The notes were issued at   98.762%   of par.  Net proceeds from this offering were approximately   $488.7 million  , after underwriting discounts and offering expenses of   $5.1 million  .  The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay our   5.65%   senior notes when due in October 2016 and to repay borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.  The remaining proceeds may be used for general partnership purposes, which may include capital expenditures.

In February 2016, we issued   $650.0 million   of our   5.00%   notes due 2026 in an underwritten public offering.  The notes were issued at   99.875%   of par.  Net proceeds from this offering were approximately   $643.8 million  , after underwriting discounts and offering expenses of   $5.4 million  .  The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes, including expansion capital. 
    
  Other Debt 
    
  Revolving Credit Facilities.    At   September 30, 2016  , the total borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility with a maturity date of October 27, 2020 was   $1.0 billion  .  Any borrowings outstanding under this facility are classified as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets.  Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from   1.000%   to   1.625%   based on our credit ratings.  Additionally, an unused commitment fee is assessed at a rate between   0.100%   and   0.275%   depending on our credit ratings.  The unused commitment fee was   0.125%   at   September 30, 2016  .  Borrowings under this facility may be used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures. As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under this facility, with   $6.3 million   obligated for letters of credit.  Amounts obligated for letters of credit are not reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets, but decrease our borrowing capacity under this facility.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the total borrowing capacity under our   364  -day credit facility was   $250.0 million  .  The maturity date of this credit facility is October 25, 2016.  See Note 14     Subsequent Events   for recent information about this credit facility.  Any borrowings under this credit facility are classified as current debt on our consolidated balance sheets.  Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from   1.000%   to   1.625%   based on our credit ratings.  Additionally, an unused commitment fee is assessed at a rate between   0.080%   and   0.225%   depending on our credit ratings.  The unused commitment fee was   0.100%   at   September 30, 2016  .  Borrowings under this facility may be used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures.  As of December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2016  , respectively, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under this facility. 
    
  Commercial Paper Program.    The maturities of our commercial paper notes vary, but may not exceed   397   days from the date of issuance.  The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par, or alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.  The commercial paper we can issue is limited by the amounts available under our revolving credit facility up to an aggregate principal amount of   $1.0 billion   and is classified as long-term debt.

    Derivative Financial Instruments 
       
  Interest Rate Derivatives 
    
  We periodically enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge the fair value of our debt or interest on expected debt issuances, and we have historically designated these derivatives as cash flow or fair value hedges for accounting purposes.  Adjustments resulting from discontinued hedges continue to be recognized in accordance with their historic hedging relationships. 
    
  During 2016, we entered into   $100.0 million   of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of variability of future interest payments on a portion of debt we anticipate issuing in 2018.  The fair values of these contracts at   September 30, 2016   were recorded on our balance sheets as an other noncurrent liability of   $3.5 million  , with the offset recorded to other comprehensive income.  We account for these agreements as cash flow hedges.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

During 2015 and 2016, we entered into   $250.0 million   of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of variability of future interest payments on a portion of debt we anticipated issuing in 2016. We accounted for these agreements as cash flow hedges.  When we issued   $500.0 million   of   4.25%   notes due 2046 in September 2016, we settled the associated interest rate swap agreements for a loss of   $19.3 million  .  The loss was recorded to other comprehensive income and will be recognized into earnings as an adjustment to our periodic interest expense accruals over the first   ten  -year payment period of the associated notes.  This loss was also reported as a net payment on financial derivatives in the financing activities of our consolidated statements of cash flows in 2016. 
    
  Commodity Derivatives 
    
  Hedging Strategies 
    
  Our butane blending activities produce gasoline products, and we can reasonably estimate the timing and quantities of sales of these products. We use a combination of NYMEX and forward purchase and sale contracts to help manage commodity price changes, which is intended to mitigate the risk of decline in the product margin realized from our butane blending activities that we choose to hedge.  Further, certain of our other commercial operations generate petroleum products.  We use NYMEX contracts to hedge against future price changes for some of these commodities. 
    
  We account for the forward physical purchase and sale contracts we use in our butane blending and fractionation activities as normal purchases and sales.  Forward contracts that qualify for and are elected as normal purchases and sales are accounted for using traditional accrual accounting.  
    
  The NYMEX contracts that we enter into fall into one of three hedge categories: 
                       Hedge Category 
      
    Hedge Purpose 
      
    Accounting Treatment 
      Qualifies For Hedge Accounting Treatment 
          Cash Flow Hedge 
      
    To hedge the variability in cash flows related to a forecasted transaction. 
      
    The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedge is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs.  Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in earnings. 
          Fair Value Hedge 
      
    To hedge against changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability. 
      
    The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedge is recorded as adjustments to the asset or liability being hedged.  Any ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized currently in earnings. 
      Does Not Qualify For Hedge Accounting Treatment 
          Economic Hedge 
      
    To effectively serve as either a fair value or a cash flow hedge; however, the derivative agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  . 
      
    Changes in the fair value of these agreements are recognized currently in earnings. 

During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , none of the commodity hedging contracts we entered into qualified for or were designated as cash flow hedges. 
    
  Period changes in the fair value of NYMEX agreements that are accounted for as economic hedges (other than those economic hedges of our butane purchases and our pipeline product overages as discussed below), the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges that are reclassified from AOCL and any ineffectiveness

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

associated with hedges related to our commodity activities are recognized currently in earnings as adjustments to product sales. 
    
  We also use NYMEX contracts, which are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, to hedge against changes in the price of butane we expect to purchase in the future.  Period changes in the fair value of these agreements are recognized currently in earnings as adjustments to cost of product sales.   
    
  We hold petroleum product inventories that we obtain from overages on our pipeline systems.  We use NYMEX contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes to help manage price changes related to these inventory barrels.  Period changes in the fair value of these agreements are recognized currently in earnings as adjustments to operating expense. 
    
  Additionally, we hold crude oil barrels that we use for operational purposes, which we classify as a long-term asset on our consolidated balance sheets as tank bottoms. We use NYMEX contracts to hedge against changes in the price of these crude oil barrels.  We record the effective portion of the gains or losses for those contracts that qualify as fair value hedges as adjustments to the assets being hedged and the ineffective portions as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as adjustments to other income or expense. 
    
  As outlined in the table below, our open NYMEX contracts at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

Energy Commodity Derivatives Contracts and Deposits Offsets 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had made margin deposits of   $30.6 million   for our NYMEX contracts with our counterparties, which were recorded as a current asset under energy commodity derivatives deposits on our consolidated balance sheets. We have the right to offset the combined fair values of our open NYMEX contracts against our margin deposits under a master netting arrangement for each counterparty; however, we have elected to present the combined fair values of our open NYMEX contracts separately from the related margin deposits on our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we have the right to offset the fair values of our NYMEX agreements together for each counterparty, which we have elected to do, and we report the combined net balances on our consolidated balance sheets. A schedule of the derivative amounts we have offset and the deposit amounts we could offset under a master netting arrangement are provided below as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

As of   September 30, 2016  , the net loss estimated to be classified to interest expense over the next twelve months from AOCL is approximately   $3.0 million  . 
    
  During   2015   and   2016  , we had open NYMEX contracts on   0.7 million   barrels of crude oil that were designated as fair value hedges.  Because there was no ineffectiveness recognized on these hedges, the cumulative gains at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   of   $27.9 million   and   $17.6 million  , respectively, from these agreements were offset by a cumulative decrease to tank bottoms.  The differential between the current spot price and forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for these fair value hedges.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , we recognized a gain (loss) of   $(1.7) million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , we recognized a gain of   $4.6 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively, for the amounts we excluded from the assessment of effectiveness of these fair value hedges, which we reported as other income/expense on our consolidated statements of income.

  Environmental Liabilities    
    
  Liabilities recognized for estimated environmental costs were   $31.4 million   and   $25.8 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively. We have classified environmental liabilities as current or noncurrent based on management s estimates regarding the timing of actual payments. Management estimates that expenditures associated with these environmental liabilities will be substantially paid over the next   9 years  .  Environmental expense recognized as a result of changes in our environmental liabilities are generally included in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Environmental expenses were   $1.3 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, and   $5.6 million   and   $4.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively. 
    
  Environmental Receivables    
    
  Receivables from insurance carriers and other third parties related to environmental matters were   $2.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  , of which   $0.7 million   and   $1.9 million   were recorded to other accounts receivable and long-term receivables, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Receivables from insurance carriers and other third parties related to environmental matters were   $2.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , of which   $0.8 million   and   $1.2 million   were recorded to other accounts receivable and long-term receivables, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.

  We are a party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business, including without limitation those disclosed in Item 1,   Legal Proceedings   of Part II of this report on Form 10-Q. While the results cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the ultimate resolution of these claims, legal actions and complaints after consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage or other indemnification arrangements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  See Note 14     Subsequent Events   for additional information about a recent event.

    Long-Term Incentive Plan 
     We have a long-term incentive plan ( LTIP ) for certain of our employees and directors of our general partner. The LTIP primarily consists of phantom units and permits the grant of awards covering an aggregate payout of   11.9 million   of our limited partner units.  The compensation committee of our general partner s board of directors administers our LTIP.  The estimated units remaining available under the LTIP at   September 30, 2016   total   3.0 million  .

Our equity-based incentive compensation expense (benefit) was as follows (in thousands): 

In February 2016,   218,046   phantom unit awards were issued pursuant to our LTIP.  These grants included both performance-based and time-based phantom unit awards and have a   three  -year vesting period that will end on December 31, 2018. 
    
  In February 2016, we issued   350,552   limited partner units to settle unit award grants to certain employees that vested on December 31, 2015.  Further,   6,117   limited partner units were issued during 2016 to settle the equity-based retainers paid to the directors of our general partner.  
    
  Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Limited Partner Unit 
    
  The difference between our actual limited partner units outstanding and our weighted-average number of limited partner units outstanding used to calculate basic net income per unit is due to the impact of: (i) the phantom

units issued to non-employee directors and (ii) the weighted average effect of units actually issued during a period.  The difference between the weighted-average number of limited partner units outstanding used for basic and diluted net income per unit calculations on our consolidated statements of income is primarily the dilutive effect of phantom unit grants associated with our LTIP that have not yet vested.

  Fair Value Methods and Assumptions - Financial Assets and Liabilities.   
    
  We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value of our financial assets and liabilities: 

Energy commodity derivatives contracts  .  These include NYMEX futures agreements related to petroleum products.  These contracts are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets.  See Note 8     Derivative Financial Instruments   for further disclosures regarding these contracts. 

Interest rate contracts.   These include forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of variability of interest payments on future debt. These contracts are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are valued based on an assumed exchange, at the end of each period, in an orderly transaction with a market participant in the market in which the financial instrument is traded. The exchange value was calculated using present value techniques on estimated future cash flows based on forward interest rate curves. See Note 8     Derivative Financial Instruments   for further disclosures regarding these contracts.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Long-term receivables.    These primarily include lease payments receivable under a direct-financing leasing arrangement and cost reimbursement payments receivable.  These receivables were recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, using then-current market rates to estimate the present value of future cash flows.  

Debt.   The fair value of our publicly traded notes was based on the prices of those notes at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  ; however, where recent observable market trades were not available, prices were determined using adjustments to the last traded value for that debt issuance or by adjustments to the prices of similar debt instruments of peer entities that are actively traded. The carrying amount of borrowings, if any, under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program approximates fair value due to the frequent repricing of these obligations.  
       
  Fair Value Measurements - Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The following tables summarize the carrying amounts, fair values and recurring fair value measurements recorded or disclosed as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   based on the three levels established by ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   (in thousands):

Recognizable events 
    
  No recognizable events occurred subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Non-recognizable events 
    
  Renewal of 364-Day Credit Facility.    In October 2016, we renewed our 364-day credit facility (see Note 7 -   Debt   for a description of this facility).  The new maturity date is October 19, 2017.  All other terms remain the same.  
    
  Anhydrous Ammonia Event.   On October 17, 2016, we experienced a release of anhydrous ammonia on our ammonia pipeline system near Tekamah, Nebraska.  The release resulted in a fatality and possible injuries.  The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the event.  On October 21, 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) issued a Corrective Action Order to Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P. related to the event, which, among other things, requires PHMSA s approval prior to re-start of the affected pipeline segment.  We are currently unable to estimate the full impact of this event.  However, we believe the impact on our financial position and results of operations is not likely to be material as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  Cash Distribution.    In October 2016, our general partner s board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of   $0.8375   per unit to be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record at the close of business on   October 31, 2016  .

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 
    
  We are a publicly traded limited partnership principally engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and crude oil. As of   September 30, 2016  , our asset portfolio, including the assets of our joint ventures, consisted of: 
             
    our refined products segment, comprised of our   9,700  -mile refined products pipeline system with   53   terminals as well as   26   independent terminals not connected to our pipeline system and our   1,100  -mile ammonia pipeline system;  

our crude oil segment, comprised of approximately   2,100   miles of crude oil pipelines and storage facilities with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately   23 million   barrels, of which approximately   15 million   barrels are used for leased storage; and 

our marine storage segment, consisting of   five   marine terminals located along coastal waterways with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately   26 million   barrels. 
       
  The following discussion provides an analysis of the results for each of our operating segments, an overview of our liquidity and capital resources and other items related to our partnership. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with (i) our accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes and (ii) our consolidated financial statements, related notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Recent Developments 
    
  Little Rock Pipeline.    In July 2016, our Little Rock pipeline began commercial service. This pipeline extends the reach of our existing pipeline system to the Little Rock, Arkansas market with the capacity to ship as much as 75,000 barrels per day of refined products from mid-continent and Gulf Coast refineries. 
    
  Saddlehorn Pipeline.   In September 2016, Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC ( Saddlehorn ) began commercial service delivering crude oil from the DJ Basin region of Colorado to existing storage facilities in Cushing, Oklahoma. This jointly-owned pipeline system has the capacity to deliver up to 190,000 barrels per day of crude oil. We do not consolidate Saddlehorn in our financial statements; however, we will recognize our 40% share of its profits in our consolidated statements of income as earnings of non-controlled entities. 
    
  Cash Distribution.   In October 2016, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of   $0.8375   per unit for the period of July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. This quarterly cash distribution will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record on   October 31, 2016  . Total distributions expected to be paid under this declaration are approximately   $190.8 million  .

Results of Operations 
    
  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures utilized by management. Operating margin, which is presented in the following tables, is an important measure used by management to evaluate the economic performance of our core operations. Operating margin is not a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) measure, but the components of operating margin are computed using amounts that are determined in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, is included in the following tables. Operating profit includes expense items, such as depreciation and amortization expense and general and administrative ( G A ) expense, which management does not focus on when evaluating the core profitability of our separate operating segments. Additionally, product margin, which management primarily uses to evaluate the profitability of our commodity-related activities, is provided in these tables. Product margin is a non-GAAP measure; however, its components of product sales revenue and cost of product sales are determined in accordance with GAAP.  Our butane blending, fractionation and other commodity-related activities generate significant revenue.  We believe the product margin from these activities, which takes into account the related cost of product sales, better represents its importance to our results of operations.

     Table of Contents  

Transportation and terminals revenue increased   $3.0   million resulting from: 
             
    an increase in refined products revenue of   $3.1   million primarily attributable to higher average tariff rates.  The average rate per barrel in the current period was favorably impacted by the mid-year 2016 tariff adjustment, which was an approximate 2% average increase over all of our markets.  Shipments decreased slightly in the current period primarily due to refinery turnarounds that favorably impacted demand on our system during third quarter 2015, partially offset by volumes from recent growth projects, including our Little Rock pipeline which commenced commercial operations in July 2016.  Additionally, revenue from leased storage along our pipeline system increased due to new customer contracts; 
                
    a decrease in crude oil revenue of   $1.1   million primarily due to lower volumes on the Longhorn pipeline as shippers utilized historical credits (earned by shipping in excess of their minimum commitments in the past) that were set to expire in the third quarter of 2016.  This decline was partially offset by higher revenue from leased storage primarily due to strong demand at our East Houston terminal; and 
                
    an increase in marine storage revenue of   $1.1   million primarily due to higher average rates from contract renewals and escalations in the current period. 
     Affiliate management fee revenue increased   $1.4   million, primarily resulting from a one-time start-up fee received from Saddlehorn, which began operations in September 2016. 
  Operating expenses decreased by   $12.1   million primarily resulting from: 
             
    a decrease in refined products expenses of   $13.2   million primarily due to lower asset integrity spending related to the timing of tank maintenance work, lower environmental accruals related to historical remediation sites, more favorable product overages in the current period (which reduce operating expenses) and lower asset retirements, partially offset by rental costs related to a pipeline segment we began leasing in third quarter 2016 in connection with our Little Rock pipeline; 
                
    an increase in crude oil expenses of   $0.2   million primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from additional headcount, partially offset by lower power costs; and  
                
    an increase in marine storage expenses of   $1.7   million primarily due to higher asset integrity spending related to the timing of tank inspections and maintenance work. 
     Product sales revenue resulted primarily from our butane blending activities, transmix fractionation and the sale of product gains from our operations. We utilize New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) contracts to hedge against changes in the price of petroleum products we expect to sell in the future, and we use butane futures agreements to hedge against changes in the price of butane we expect to purchase in future periods.  See Note 8    Derivative Financial Instruments   in Item 1 of Part I for a discussion of our hedging strategies and how our use of NYMEX contracts and butane futures agreements impacts our product margin.  Product margin decreased   $72.1   million due to losses on NYMEX contracts recognized in third quarter 2016 compared to gains in third quarter 2015.  See   Other Items Commodity Derivative Agreements Impact of Commodity Derivatives on Results of Operations   below for more information about our NYMEX contracts. 
  Earnings of non-controlled entities increased   $3.0   million primarily attributable to increased earnings from BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC ( BridgeTex ) due to higher shipments in third quarter 2016, as well as earnings from Saddlehorn, which began operating during third quarter 2016. 
  Depreciation and amortization increased   $4.9   million primarily due to expansion capital projects recently placed into service and $2.5 million of asset impairment charges in third quarter 2016, mainly related to an inactive pipeline terminal. 
  G A expense decreased   $1.9   million primarily due to reduced personnel costs from a lower bonus payout accrual and more overhead costs capitalized, partially offset by higher deferred board of director fees.  
  
    31 

     Table of Contents  

Interest expense, net of interest income and interest capitalized, increased   $5.9   million in third quarter 2016, primarily because our debt balance was higher in the current period compared to the same period in third quarter 2015, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.  Our average outstanding debt increased from $3.4 billion in third quarter 2015 to $4.0 billion in third quarter 2016 primarily due to borrowings for expansion capital expenditures, including $650.0 million of senior notes issued in February 2016 and $500.0 million of senior notes issued in September 2016.  Our weighted-average interest rate of 4.9% in third quarter 2016 was higher than the 4.7% rate incurred in third quarter 2015.    
  Other expense (income) was   $5.0   million favorable due in part to a more favorable non-cash adjustment for the change in the current period in the differential between the current spot price and forward price on fair value hedges associated with our crude oil tank bottoms.  Additionally, other income for the current period includes a break-up fee related to a potential acquisition.

Transportation and terminals revenue increased   $26.6   million resulting from: 
             
    an increase in refined products revenue of   $16.7   million primarily attributable to higher average tariff rates and increased shipments.  The average rate per barrel in the current period was favorably impacted by the mid-year 2015 tariff rate increase of 4.6% and the mid-year 2016 increase which averaged approximately 2% across all of our markets.  Shipments increased 1% in the current period primarily associated with higher gasoline shipments, additional volumes from recent growth projects, including our Little Rock pipeline which commenced commercial operations in July 2016, and increased demand for aviation fuel.  Additionally, revenue from leased storage along our pipeline system increased due to new customer contracts; 
                
    an increase in crude oil revenue of   $9.1   million primarily due to higher average rates and more shipments on our Longhorn pipeline system, as well as new leased storage contracts.  Overall crude oil shipments declined and average rate per barrel increased due to fewer barrels moving on our lower-priced Houston distribution system tariff structure to their ultimate destination.  Instead, customers utilized space available on our capacity lease for shipments from BridgeTex pipeline; and 
                
    an increase in marine storage revenue of   $0.9   million primarily due to higher average contract renewal rates, other escalations in the current period, and new contracts, partially offset by lower miscellaneous revenue due to lower customer activity. 
     Affiliate management fee revenue increased   $0.6   million primarily resulting from a one-time start-up fee received from Saddlehorn, which began operations in September 2016, partially offset by lower construction management fees received from BridgeTex and lower fees from Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC ( Osage ) due to the transfer of our 50% membership interest in 2016. 
  Operating expenses decreased by   $3.7   million primarily resulting from: 
             
    a decrease in refined products expenses of   $8.0   million primarily due to lower asset integrity spending related to the timing of tank maintenance work, lower environmental costs and more favorable product gains (which reduce operating expenses), partially offset by more product handling costs related to the receipt of off-spec product during 2016 and higher asset retirements; 
                
    an increase in crude oil expenses of   $1.4   million primarily due to increased personnel costs, additional environmental accruals due to a product release in the current year and higher property taxes, partially offset by lower power costs and more favorable product overages (which reduce operating expenses); and  
                
    an increase in marine storage expenses of   $4.0   million primarily due to higher asset integrity spending related to the timing of tank maintenance work. 
     Product margin decreased   $63.5   million compared to 2015 primarily due to losses on NYMEX contracts recognized in 2016 compared to gains in 2015.  See   Other Items Commodity Derivative Agreements Impact of Commodity Derivatives on Results of Operations   below for more information about our NYMEX contracts. 
  Earnings of non-controlled entities increased   $1.9   million primarily attributable to increased earnings from Double Eagle Pipeline LLC ( Double Eagle ) due to increased shipments during 2016 and earnings from Saddlehorn, which began operations in September 2016, partially offset by lower earnings from Osage due to the transfer of our 50% membership interest in first quarter 2016. 
  Depreciation and amortization increased   $9.9   million primarily due to expansion capital projects placed into service and $2.5 million of asset impairment charges during 2016 mainly related to an inactive pipeline terminal. 
  G A expense was   $0.1   million higher primarily due to higher deferred board of director fees, partially offset by a separation fee paid to a former executive in 2015. 
  Interest expense, net of interest income and interest capitalized, increased   $12.4   million in 2016, primarily because our debt balance was higher in the current period compared to the same period in 2015, partially offset by  
  
    34 

     Table of Contents  

higher capitalized interest.  Our average outstanding debt increased from $3.3 billion in 2015 to $3.8 billion in 2016 primarily due to borrowings for expansion capital expenditures, including $650.0 million of senior notes issued in February 2016 and $500.0 million of senior notes issued in September 2016.  Our weighted-average interest rate of 4.9% in 2016 was higher than the 4.7% rate incurred in 2015.    
  In 2016, we recognized a   $28.1   million gain related to the transfer of our 50% membership interest in Osage.  See Note 4     Investments in Non-Controlled Entities   in Item 1 of Part I of this report for more details regarding this transaction. 
  Other income increased   $3.0   million primarily due to a break-up fee received in 2016 related to a potential acquisition. 

Distributable Cash Flow 
    
  We calculate the non-GAAP measures of distributable cash flow ( DCF ) and adjusted EBITDA in the table below.  Management uses DCF as a basis for recommending to our general partner s board of directors the amount of cash distributions to be paid to our limited partners each period.  Management also uses DCF as a basis for determining the payouts for the performance-based awards issued under our equity-based compensation plan.  Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that we and the investment community use to assess the financial results of an entity.  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures utilized by management for these evaluations.  A reconciliation of DCF and adjusted EBITDA for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   to net income, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, follows (in millions):  
  
    35 

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    In 2015, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03, Interest:   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.    Under this new accounting standard, we have reclassified debt issuance cost amortization expense as interest expense.  For the purposes of calculating DCF, we have excluded debt issuance cost amortization from interest expense of $1.9 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  
              (2) 
    Because we intend to satisfy vesting of units under our equity-based incentive compensation program with the issuance of limited partner units, expenses related to this program generally are deemed non-cash and added back for DCF purposes.  Total equity-based incentive compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 was $15.2 million and $14.7 million, respectively.  However, the figures above include an adjustment for minimum statutory tax withholdings we paid in 2015 and 2016 of $17.8 million and $14.4 million, respectively, for equity-based incentive compensation units that vested on the previous year end, which reduces DCF. 
              (3) 
    In February 2016, we transferred our 50% membership interest in Osage to an affiliate of HollyFrontier Corporation ( HFC ).  In conjunction with this transaction, we entered into several commercial agreements with affiliates of HFC, which we recorded as intangible assets and other receivables in our consolidated balance sheets.  We recorded a $28.1 million non-cash gain in relation to this transaction. 
              (4) 
    In conjunction with the February 2016 Osage transaction, HFC agreed to make certain payments to us until HFC completes a connection to our El Paso terminal.  These payments replace distributions we would have received had the Osage transaction not occurred and are, therefore, included in our calculation of DCF. 
              (5) 
    Certain derivatives we use as economic hedges have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes and the mark-to-market changes of these derivatives are recognized currently in earnings. In addition, we have designated certain derivatives we use to hedge our crude oil tank bottoms as fair value hedges, and the change in the differential between the current spot price and forward price on these hedges is recognized currently in earnings.  We exclude the net impact of both of these adjustments from our determination of DCF until the hedged products are physically sold.  In the period in which these products are physically sold, the net impact of the associated hedges is included in our determination of DCF. 
              (6) 
    We add the amount of lower-of-cost-or-market ( LCM ) adjustments on inventory and firm purchase commitments we recognize in each applicable period to determine DCF as these are non-cash charges against income.  In subsequent periods when we physically sell or purchase the related products, we deduct the LCM adjustments previously recognized to determine DCF. 
              (7) 
    Maintenance capital expenditure projects maintain our existing assets and do not generate incremental DCF (i.e. incremental returns to our unitholders).  For this reason, we deduct maintenance capital expenditures to determine DCF.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures 
    
  Operating Activities.   Operating cash flows consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $724.1 million   and   $639.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   and   2016  , respectively. The   $85.1 million   decrease from   2015   to   2016   was due to changes in our working capital, adjustments for non-cash items and lower net income related to activities previously described. 
  Investing Activities.   Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investments in non-controlled entities and acquisitions. 
  Net cash used by investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015   and   2016   was   $606.8 million   and   $682.1 million  , respectively. During 2016, we incurred   $514.2 million   for capital expenditures, which included   $86.1 million   for maintenance capital and   $428.1 million   for expansion capital. Also during the 2016 period, we contributed capital of   $174.9 million   in conjunction with our joint venture capital projects, which we account for as investments in non-controlled entities. During 2015, we incurred   $439.7 million   for capital expenditures, which included   $64.7 million   for maintenance capital and   $375.0 million   for expansion capital. Also during the 2015 period, we acquired a refined products terminal in the Atlanta, Georgia market for $54.7 million and contributed capital of   $133.4 million   in conjunction with our joint venture capital projects.  
  Financing Activities.   Financing cash flows consist primarily of distributions to our unitholders and borrowings and repayments under long-term notes and our commercial paper program. 
  Net cash used by financing activities was   $125.4 million   and net cash provided by financing activities was   $305.5 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  During 2016, we have paid cash distributions of   $548.4 million   to our unitholders. Additionally, we received net proceeds of $1.1 billion from borrowings under long-term notes, which were used in part to repay borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes, including expansion capital. Net commercial paper repayments during 2016 have totaled $245.0 million. In connection with certain of the borrowings under long-term notes, we paid $19.3 million in settlement of associated interest rate swap agreements. Also, in February 2016, the cumulative amounts of the January 2013 equity-based incentive compensation award grants were settled by issuing 350,552 limited partner units and distributing those units to the long-term incentive plan ( LTIP ) participants, resulting in payments of associated tax withholdings of   $14.4 million  . During 2015, we paid cash distributions of   $489.5 million   to our unitholders. Additionally, we received net proceeds of $499.6 million from borrowings under long-term notes, which were used in part to repay borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes, including expansion capital. In connection with the borrowings under long-term notes, we paid $42.9 million in settlement of associated interest rate swap agreements. Also, in January 2015, the cumulative amounts of the January 2012 equity-based incentive compensation award grants were settled by issuing 354,529 limited partner units and distributing those units to the LTIP participants, resulting in payments of associated tax withholdings of   $17.8 million  . 
  The quarterly distribution amount related to our third-quarter 2016 financial results (to be paid in fourth quarter 2016) is   $0.8375   per unit.  If we are able to meet management s targeted distribution growth of 10% for 2016 and the number of outstanding limited partner units remains at 227.8 million, total cash distributions of approximately $755.0 million will be paid to our unitholders related to 2016 earnings.  Management believes we will have sufficient DCF to fund these distributions.

    Maintenance capital expenditures.  These expenditures include costs required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental or other regulatory requirements rather than to generate incremental DCF; and 
                
    Expansion capital expenditures.  These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental DCF and include costs to acquire additional assets to grow our business and to expand or upgrade our existing facilities, which we refer to as organic growth projects.  Organic growth projects include capital expenditures that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources. 
       
  For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , our maintenance capital spending was   $86.1 million  . For   2016  , we expect to spend approximately $105.0 million on maintenance capital. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we spent   $428.1 million   for organic growth capital and contributed   $174.9 million   for capital projects in conjunction with our joint ventures. Based on the progress of expansion projects already underway, we expect to spend approximately $850 million during 2016, $300 million during 2017 and $250 million during 2018 to complete our current projects.  These estimates include $335 million to construct our new marine terminal in Pasadena, Texas, including approximately one million barrels of storage on nearly 200 acres of newly-acquired land and a ship dock, which are expected to be operational in early 2019. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Cash generated from operations is our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service, maintenance capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our unitholders. Additional liquidity for purposes other than quarterly distributions, such as expansion capital expenditures and debt repayments, is available through borrowings under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities, as well as from other borrowings or issuances of debt or limited partner units (see Note 7     Debt   of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for detail of our borrowings and debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2016  ). If capital markets do not permit us to issue additional debt and equity securities, our business may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to acquire additional assets and businesses, fund organic growth projects or continue paying cash distributions at the current level.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  None. 

Environmental 
    
  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We have accrued liabilities for estimated costs at our facilities and properties. We record liabilities when environmental costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The determination of amounts recorded for environmental liabilities involves significant judgments and assumptions by management. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in determining environmental liabilities, it is reasonably possible that the actual amounts required to extinguish these liabilities could be materially different from those we have recognized.

Other Items 
    
  Condensate Splitter  .   We are constructing a condensate splitter at our terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas based on a commitment from a single customer, an affiliate of Trafigura, AG.  The project also includes construction of more than one million barrels of storage, dock improvements and two additional truck rack bays at our terminal as well as pipeline connectivity between our terminal and a nearby facility also used by our customer.  Due to construction delays, we currently expect the project to be operational late in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the total cost of the project to be approximately $300 million, approximately one third of which relates to the splitter and the remainder to the related infrastructure.  Further delays in the construction, commissioning or testing of the facility could result in additional costs or a delay in our realizing revenues or profits from the project, and in certain circumstances could result in the termination by our customer of its commitment to us as early as first quarter 2017, which could materially reduce the revenues and profits we expect to realize from the project and the value of the splitter. 
    
  Commodity Derivative Agreements  .  Certain of the business activities in which we engage result in our owning various commodities, which exposes us to commodity price risk. We use forward physical commodity contracts and NYMEX contracts to help manage this commodity price risk. We use forward physical contracts to purchase butane and sell refined products. We account for these forward physical contracts as normal purchase and sale contracts, using traditional accrual accounting.  We use NYMEX contracts to hedge against changes in prices of refined products and crude oil that we expect to sell and of butane that we expect to purchase in future periods. We use and account for those NYMEX contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment as either cash flow or fair value hedges, and we use and account for those NYMEX contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as economic hedges.  As of and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our open derivative contracts and the impact of the derivatives we settled during the period were as follows: 
    
  Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedges 

NYMEX contracts covering 0.7 million barrels of crude oil to hedge against future price changes of crude oil tank bottoms. These contracts, which we are accounting for as fair value hedges, mature November 2017. Through   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative amount of gains from these agreements was   $17.6 million  . The cumulative gains from these fair value hedges were recorded as adjustments to the asset being hedged, and there has been no ineffectiveness recognized for these hedges. We exclude the differential between the current spot price and forward price from our assessment of hedge effectiveness for these fair value hedges.  The net change in the amounts excluded from our assessment of hedge effectiveness during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a gain of   $4.5 million  , which we recognized as other income on our consolidated statements of income. 
       
  Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedges   Open 
             
    NYMEX contracts covering 4.7 million barrels of refined products and crude oil related to our butane blending, fractionation and certain crude oil inventory.  These contracts mature between October 2016 and April 2017 and are being accounted for as economic hedges. Through   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative amount of net unrealized losses associated with these agreements was $13.6 million. We recorded these net losses as an adjustment to product sales revenue, of which $7.0 million of net gains was recognized in 2015 and $20.6 million of net losses was recognized in 2016.  

NYMEX contracts covering 0.4 million barrels of refined products and crude oil related to inventory we carry that resulted from pipeline product overages.  These contracts, which mature between October and December 2016, are being accounted for as economic hedges. Through   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative amount of net unrealized losses associated with these agreements was $2.0 million. We recorded these losses as an adjustment to operating expense, all of which was recognized in 2016. 

NYMEX contracts covering 1.3 million barrels of butane purchases that mature between October 2016 and April 2017, which are being accounted for as economic hedges. Through   September 30, 2016  , the  
     
    39 

     Table of Contents  

cumulative amount of net unrealized gains associated with these agreements was $3.1 million. We recorded these gains as an adjustment to cost of product sales, of which $0.4 million of net losses was recognized in 2015 and $3.5 million of net gains was recognized in 2016.  
    
  Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedges   Settled 

NYMEX contracts covering 7.9 million barrels of refined products and crude oil related to economic hedges of products from our butane blending, fractionation and certain crude oil inventory activities that we sold during   2016  .  We recognized a gain of   $12.2 million   in 2016 related to these contracts, which we recorded as an adjustment to product sales revenue. 

NYMEX contracts covering 7.8 million barrels of refined products and crude oil related to economic hedges of product inventories from product overages on our pipeline system that we sold during   2016  .  We recognized a gain of   $0.8 million   in 2016 on the settlement of these contracts, which we recorded as an adjustment to operating expense. 

NYMEX contracts covering 1.1 million barrels related to economic hedges of butane purchases we made during   2016   associated with our butane blending activities.  We recognized a gain of   $0.1 million   in 2016 on the settlement of these contracts, which we recorded as an adjustment to cost of product sales.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  We may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates and have established policies to monitor and control these market risks. We use derivative agreements to help manage our exposure to commodity price and interest rate risks.   
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  Our commodity price risk primarily arises from our butane blending and fractionation activities, and from managing product overages associated with our refined products and crude oil pipelines.  We use derivatives such as forward physical contracts and NYMEX contracts to help us manage commodity price risk.   
    
  Forward physical contracts that qualify for and are elected as normal purchases and sales are accounted for using traditional accrual accounting.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had commitments under forward purchase and sale contracts used in our butane blending and fractionation activities as follows (in millions): 

We use NYMEX contracts to hedge against changes in the price of petroleum products we expect to sell or purchase.  Some of these NYMEX contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment, and we designate and account for these contracts as either cash flow or fair value hedges.  We account for those NYMEX contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as economic hedges.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had open NYMEX contracts representing   5.8 million   barrels of petroleum products we expect to sell in the future.  Additionally, we had open NYMEX contracts for   1.3 million   barrels of butane we expect to purchase in the future.  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our open NYMEX contracts was a net liability of   $12.3 million  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , open NYMEX contracts, primarily sales contracts, representing   5.1 million   barrels of petroleum products did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. A $10.00 per barrel increase in the price of these NYMEX contracts for the related petroleum products would result in a   $51.0 million   decrease in our operating profit and a $10.00 per barrel decrease in the price of these NYMEX contracts would result in a   $51.0 million   increase in our operating profit.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had open NYMEX contracts, primarily purchase contracts, representing   1.3 million   barrels of butane we expect to purchase in the future.  Relative to these agreements, a $10.00 per barrel increase in the price of butane would result in a   $13.0 million   increase in our operating profit and a $10.00 per barrel decrease in the price of butane would result in a   $13.0 million   decrease in our operating profit. 
    
  The increases or decreases in operating profit we recognize from our open NYMEX forward sales and price swap contracts would be substantially offset by higher or lower product sales revenue or cost of product sales when the physical sale or purchase of those products occur. These contracts may be for the purchase or sale of product in markets different from those in which we are attempting to hedge our exposure and the resulting hedges may not eliminate all price risks.

Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our use of variable rate debt and any forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt expose us to interest rate risk. 
    
  During 2016, we entered into $100.0 million of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of variability of future interest payments on a portion of debt we anticipate issuing in 2018.  The fair value of these contracts at September 30, 2016 was a net liability of $3.5 million.  We account for these agreements as cash flow hedges.  A 0.125% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of this liability of approximately $3.0 million.  A 0.125% increase in interest rates would result in a favorable impact of approximately $2.7 million. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by the date of this report. We performed this evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our general partner s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our general partner s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and practices are effective in providing reasonable assurance that all required disclosures are included in the current report. Additionally, these disclosure controls and practices are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Certain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act that discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as  anticipates,   targets,   believes,   continue,   could,   estimates,   expects,   forecasts,   goal,   guidance,   intends,   may,   might,   plans,   potential,   projected,   scheduled,   should,   will  and other similar expressions. Although we believe our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, statements made regarding future results are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may be materially different from the results stated or implied in such forward-looking statements included in this report.

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     Clean   Water Act Information Requests and Claims.   In July 2011, we received an information request from the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act regarding a pipeline release near Texas City, Texas in February 2011 (the "Texas Release").  In April 2012, we received a similar information request from the EPA pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act regarding a pipeline release near Nemaha, Nebraska in December 2011 (the "Nebraska Release").   In October 2015, we received a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ Letter") stating that the Clean Water Act claims arising out of the Texas Release, the Nebraska Release and a pipeline release near El Dorado, Kansas in May 2015 have all been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for enforcement.  The DOJ Letter proposed a settlement of Clean Water Act claims related to the three releases in the form of an enforceable commitment from us to take certain yet to be determined steps to prevent future releases and a civil penalty of $2.8 million.  In response to the DOJ Letter, we are engaged in discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice in an effort to settle the Clean Water Act claims on terms that are mutually agreeable.  While the results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  U.S  . Oil Recovery, EPA ID No.: TXN000607093 Superfund Site.   We have liability at the U.S. Oil Recovery Superfund Site in Pasadena, Texas as a potential responsible party ( PRP ) under Section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ( CERCLA ). As a result of the EPA s Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Removal Action, filed August 25, 2011, EPA Region 6, CERCLA Docket No. 06-10-11, we voluntarily entered into the PRP group responsible for the site investigation, stabilization and subsequent site cleanup. We have paid $15,000 associated with the assessment phase. Until this assessment phase has been completed, we cannot reasonably estimate our proportionate share of the remediation costs associated with this site.  While the results cannot be reasonably estimated, we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  Lake   Calumet Cluster Site, EPA ID No.: ILD000716852 Superfund Site.    We have liability at the Lake Calumet Cluster Superfund Site in Chicago, Illinois as a PRP under Sections 107(a) and 113(f)(1) of CERCLA.  As a result of the EPA s Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order for Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study of June 2013, we are in the process of voluntarily entering the PRP group responsible for the investigation, cleanup and installation of an appropriate clay cap over the site.  We have paid $8,000 associated with the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study and cleanup costs to date.  Our projected portion of the estimated cap installation is $55,000.  While the results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Anhydrous Ammonia Event.   On October 17, 2016, we experienced a release of anhydrous ammonia on our ammonia pipeline system near Tekamah, Nebraska.  The release resulted in a fatality and possible injuries.  The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the event.  On October 21, 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) issued a Corrective Action Order to Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P. related to the event, which, among other things, requires PHMSA s approval prior to re-start of the affected pipeline segment.  We are currently unable to estimate the full impact of this event.  However, we believe the impact on our financial position and results of operations is not likely to be material as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  We   are a party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. While the results cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the ultimate resolution of these claims, legal actions and complaints after consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage or other indemnification arrangements will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
