              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements        6            BAYNON INTERNATIONAL CORP.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015     (UNAUDITED)        1.   THE COMPANY       Baynon International Corp. formerly known as Technology Associates Corporation (the  Company ), was originally incorporated on February 29, 1968 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking.  On December 28, 1989, the Company reincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada.  The Company was formerly engaged in the technology marketing business and its securities traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers OTC Bulletin Board.  The Company has not engaged in any business operations for at least the last twelve fiscal years and has no operations to date.       The Company will attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company.  In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the company or wish to contribute assets to the Company rather than merge.       No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company.  The Company provides a means for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting (public) company whose securities would be qualified for trading in the United States secondary market.       2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Interim Presentation    The December 31, 2015 balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.       The statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.       While the Company believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.            7            Loss Per Share    The Company computes loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share .  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding, which includes convertible debentures, stock options and warrants. The following securities have been excluded from the calculation of loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as their effect would be anti-dilutive:              Going Concern    The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred continuing operating losses and has an accumulated deficit of $418,490 at September 30, 2016.  The Company has no revenue generating operations and has limited cash resources.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.        Management believes that it will be able to achieve a satisfactory level of liquidity to meet the Company s obligations through September 30, 2017 by obtaining additional financing from key officers, directors and certain investors.  However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments    The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, notes payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of those instruments.        Recently Issued Accounting Standards    Management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.                8             3.   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE - STOCKHOLDER       On May 18, 2015, the Company issued an unsecured convertible note payable to a stockholder in exchange for $25,000 in cash for the Company s working capital needs. The note bears interest at 6% per annum was set to mature on May 18, 2016.        On May 18, 2016 the note was extended for an additional twelve months. The stockholder has the option to convert the note and accrued interest into the Company s common stock at $.0125 per share.       On September 9, 2016, the Company issued an unsecured convertible note payable to a stockholder in exchange for $20,000 in cash for the Company s working capital needs. The note bears interest at 6% per annum and matures on September 9, 2017. The stockholder has the option to convert the note and accrued interest into the Company s common stock at $.0125 per share.       At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued interest on the notes were $2,135 and $937, respectively.  Interest expense amounted to $1,198 and $1,036 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $450 and $379 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       4.    COMMON STOCK       On September 19, 2013, the Company s board of directors approved the increase in the number of authorized shares from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000. The increase will enable the Company to raise additional capital in the future. The Company has not yet completed the process to date.       Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Director in its discretion from funds legally available. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata in all assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities. All of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Company s common stock. There are no conversions or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock.       5.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financials were issued.        9           Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Forward-Looking Statements    This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include those concerning the following:  Our intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding the fair value of all assets and liabilities recorded; our strategies; growth opportunities; product development and introduction relating to new and existing products; the enterprise market and related opportunities; competition and competitive advantages and disadvantages; industry standards and compatibility of our products; relationships with our employees; our facilities, operating lease and our ability to secure additional space; cash dividends; excess inventory, our expenses; interest and other income; our beliefs and expectations about our future success and results; our operating results; our belief that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements, our expectations regarding our revenues and customers; investments and interest rates.  These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially.       Baynon International Corp. (the  Company ) undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.        Critical Accounting Policies    The financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with certain amount based on management s best estimates and judgments. To determine appropriate carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, management uses assumptions based on historical results and other factors that believe are reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Our critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.        Trends and Uncertainties    There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time.  There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our limited operations. There are no known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of the Company s financial statements.            10            Liquidity and Capital Resources    At September 30, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $20,219, which represents a $16,427 increase from the $3,792 balance at December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily the result of the issuance of a note payable net of cash used to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company. The Company s working capital deficit at September 30, 2016 was $65,120 as compared to a December 31, 2015 deficit of $48,154.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $16,966. We had the following adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: we had an increase of $12,195 due to accounts payable and accrued expenses and had an increase of $1,198 due to accrued interest due to stockholder. As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $3,573 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $14,194. We had the following adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: we had a decrease of $12,733 due to accounts payable and accrued expenses and had an increase of $1,035 due to accrued interest due to stockholder. As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $25,892 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not pursue any investing activities.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received proceeds from related party note payable of $20,000, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $20,000 for the period.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received proceeds from related party note payable of $25,000, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $25,000 for the period.       The focus of the Company s efforts is to acquire or develop an operating business. Despite no active operations at this time, management intends to continue in business and has no intention to liquidate the Company.  The Company has considered various business alternatives including the possible acquisition of an existing business, but to date has found possible opportunities unsuitable or excessively priced.  The Company does not contemplate limiting the scope of its search to any particular industry.  Management has considered the risk of possible opportunities as well as their potential rewards.  Management has invested time evaluating several proposals for possible acquisition or combination; however, none of these opportunities were pursued. The Company presently owns no real property and at this time has no intention of acquiring any such property. The Company s sole expected expenses are comprised of professional fees primarily incident to its reporting requirements.        11               The accompanying financial statement has been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred losses of $16,966 and $14,194 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a working capital deficiency which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.       Management believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever.  Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required.  Our auditors have included a  going concern  qualification in their auditors  report dated April 1, 2016. Such a  going concern  qualification may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured.       The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually improve the Company s operating results.        Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, compared to the Nine Months ended September 30, 2015.        The Company incurred a net loss of $16,966 in the current period versus a net loss of $14,194 in the prior period, an increase of $2,772. General and administrative expenses were $15,771 compared to $13,166 in the prior period, an increase of $2,605. General and administrative expenses were incurred primarily to enable the Company to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company.       During the current and prior period, the Company did not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty associated with the Company s ability to merge with an operating company, which might permit the Company to avail itself of those advantages.        Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, compared to the Three months ended September 30, 2015.        The Company incurred a net loss of $5,505 in the current period versus a net loss of $4,499 in the prior period, an increase of $1,006. General and administrative expenses were $5,057 compared to $4,122 in the prior period, an increase of $935. General and administrative expenses were incurred primarily to enable the Company to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company.        12               During the current and prior period, the Company did not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty associated with the Company s ability to merge with an operating company, which might permit the Company to avail itself of those advantages.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Not applicable for a smaller reporting company.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.  Based on the existence of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide such reasonable assurances.        We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud.  Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.  Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any.  The design of disclosure controls and procedures is also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.             13            Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses        At such time that it is economically feasible, we will aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we maintain adequate segregation of duties and have controls in place to ensure proper disclosures are in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe that these corrective steps will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is trained, we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient. We may be required to expend additional resources to identify, assess and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control.         Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                                                 14            PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1.
