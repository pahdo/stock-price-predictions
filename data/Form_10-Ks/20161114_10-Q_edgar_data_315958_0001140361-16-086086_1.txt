CONDENSED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

(1) Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of CreditRiskMonitor.com, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosure required by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all material adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, and have been prepared in a manner consistent with the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of a full fiscal year.

The December 31, 2015 balance sheet has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company has identified certain immaterial errors in previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 related to the accounting for non-qualified stock options. These immaterial errors resulted in a cumulative overstatement of its deferred tax liability and tax provision in the amount of $46,707 as well as a cumulative overstatement of additional paid-in capital and prepaid taxes in the amount of $194,054. The Company reviewed the accounting errors utilizing SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99,  Materiality  ( SAB 99 ) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,  Effects of Prior Year Misstatements on Current Year Financial Statements  ( SAB 108 ) and determined the impact of the errors to be immaterial to any prior period s presentation. The accompanying Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 reflects the corrections of the aforementioned immaterial error.

(2) Stock Split

On October 21, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a 1.3-for-1 split of its common stock, in the form of a 30% stock dividend, payable to stockholders of record as of November 30, 2015. Shares resulting from the split were issued on December 15, 2015. All share and per share amounts for all prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.

(3) Stock-Based Compensation

The Company applies ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ) to account for stock-based compensation.

The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense for stock options that was recorded in the Company s results of operations in accordance with ASC 718 for the three and nine months ended September 30:

Index 

(4) Other Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC had issued certain accounting pronouncements as of September 30, 2016 that will become effective in subsequent periods; however, management does not believe that any of those pronouncements would have significantly affected the Company s financial accounting measurements or disclosures had they been in effect during the interim periods for which financial statements are included in this quarterly report. Management also believes those pronouncements will not have a significant effect on the Company s future financial position or results of operations.

(5) Fair Value Measurements

The Company records its financial instruments that are accounted for under ASC 320,  Investments-Debt and Equity Securities  at fair value. The determination of fair value is based upon the fair value framework established by ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 provides that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.  The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of inputs as follows: (a) Level 1   valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; (b) Level 2   valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and (c) Level 3   valuations based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable, thus, reflecting assumptions about the market participants. 

The Company s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are stated at fair value. The carrying value of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximates fair market value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.

The Company s cash equivalents and marketable securities are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. Marketable securities include mutual funds.

The table below sets forth the Company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy.

The Company did not hold financial assets and liabilities which were recorded at fair value in the Level 2 or 3 categories as of either September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

Index 

(6) Net Income (Loss) per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options:

Potential common shares of 60,900 and 114,660 related to the Company's outstanding stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted income per share for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as inclusion of these shares would have been anti-dilutive. All outstanding stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016 as they were anti-dilutive. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, the computation of diluted net income per share excludes the effects of the assumed exercise of 178,317 options, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive as their exercise prices were above market value.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Environment

Despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. economy, the continuing uncertainty in the worldwide financial system has negatively impacted general business conditions. It is possible that a weakened economy could adversely affect our clients  need for credit information, or even their solvency, but we cannot predict whether or to what extent this will occur.

Our strategic priorities and plans for 2016 are to continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable, profitable growth. Global market conditions, however, may affect the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these initiatives in 2016.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

The Company has invested some of its excess cash in debt instruments of the United States Government and mutual funds. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents, while those with maturities in excess of three months when purchased are reflected as marketable securities.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $9.84 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of approximately $872,000 from December 31, 2015. The reason for this increase was that cash generated by operating activities ($1,000,000) exceeded the cash used to acquire property and equipment ($157,000).

The Company s cash provided by operating activities was positive despite its net loss for the nine months primarily due to the 23% decrease in accounts receivable and the 6% increase in deferred revenue.   Additionally, the main component of current liabilities at September 30, 2016 is deferred revenue of $7.86 million, which should not require significant future cash outlay other than the cost of preparation and delivery of the applicable commercial credit reports which cost much less than the deferred revenue shown. The deferred revenue is recognized as income over the subscription term, which approximates twelve months. The Company has no bank lines of credit or other currently available credit sources.

The Company believes that its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Company has been cash flow positive for 9 of the last 10 fiscal years and has no long-term debt. However, the Company s liquidity could be negatively affected if it were to make an acquisition or license products or technologies, which may necessitate the need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to the Company.

Results of Operations

Operating revenues increased $84,438, or 3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This overall revenue growth resulted from an increase in Internet subscription service revenue, attributable to increased sales to new and existing subscribers.

Data and product costs increased $119,855, or 11%, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This increase was due primarily to  higher  salary and related employee benefits, as the Company increased its headcount.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $172,394, or 11%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This increase was due to higher marketing expenditures and higher salary and related employee benefits .  The increase in marketing expenses is part of our 2016 plan to drive increased traffic to the Company s website, and improve customers  experience using the website, with the hope of incremental future sales. This is the Company s first significant marketing campaign and it includes investment in a substantial redesign of the website, which was launched early in the second quarter.   

Depreciation and amortization decreased $5,576, or 10%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period of  fiscal 2015.  This decrease was due to a lower depreciable asset base reflecting the continued use of certain items that have been fully depreciated. The increase in property and equipment, net since year end is due to a deposit made at the end of the first quarter for a new telephone system that was not installed until mid- September.

Other expense, net decreased $4,091 for third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period last year. This decrease was due to a smaller negative mark-to-market adjustment related to the Company s investments recorded in this year s third quarter.

Provision for income taxes decreased $78,698 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This decrease was due to the Company having lower pre-tax income because of the reasons enumerated above.

Index 

Operating revenues increased $199,901, or 2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This overall revenue growth resulted from an increase in Internet subscription service revenue, attributable to increased sales to new and existing subscribers.

Data and product costs increased $148,344, or 4%, for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This increase was due primarily to  higher  salary and related employee benefits, as the Company increased its headcount, partially offset by the lower cost associated with the outsourcing of certain data entry tasks, as less tasks have been outsourced, and lower data costs, as the Company incurred the cost of a one-time feed in 2015.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $775,834, or 15%, for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This increase was due to higher marketing expenditures and higher salary and related employee benefits .  The increase in marketing expenses is part of our 2016 plan to drive increased traffic to the Company s website, and improve customers  experience using the website, with the hope of incremental future sales. This is the Company s first significant marketing campaign and it includes investment in a substantial redesign of the website, which was launched early in the second quarter.

Depreciation and amortization decreased $19,629 or 12%, for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This decrease was due to a lower depreciable asset base reflecting the continued use of certain items that have been fully depreciated. The increase in property and equipment, net since year end is due to a deposit made at the end of the first quarter for a new telephone system that was not installed until mid- September.

Other income, net increased $32,578 for first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period last year. This increase was due to a larger mark-to-market adjustment related to the Company s investments recorded in this year s first nine months.

Provision for income taxes decreased $260,065 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. This decrease was due to the Company being in a pre-tax loss position in 2016 versus a pre-tax income position in 2015 because of the reasons enumerated above.

Future Operations

The Company over time intends to expand its operations by expanding the breadth and depth of its product and service offerings and introducing new and complementary products. Gross margins attributable to new business areas may be lower than those associated with the Company s existing business activities.

As a result of the evolving nature of the markets in which it competes, the Company s ability to accurately forecast its revenues, gross profits and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales is limited. The Company s current and future expense levels are based largely on its investment plans and estimates of future revenues. To a large extent these costs do not vary with revenue. Sales and operating results generally depend on the Company s ability to attract and retain customers and the volume of and timing of customer subscriptions for the Company s services, which are difficult to forecast. The Company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to the Company s planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, the Company may from time to time make certain pricing, service, marketing or acquisition decisions that could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Achieving greater profitability depends on the Company s ability to generate and sustain increased revenue levels. The Company believes that its success will depend in large part on its ability to (i) increase its brand awareness, (ii) provide its customers with outstanding value, thus encouraging customer renewals, and (iii) achieve sufficient sales volume to realize economies of scale. Accordingly, the Company intends to continue to increase the size of its sales force and service staff, and to invest in product development, operating infrastructure, marketing and promotion. The Company believes that these expenditures will help it to sustain the revenue growth it has experienced over the last several years. We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenues during the remainder of 2016 and future periods as the Company continues to expand its business on a worldwide basis. Further, the Company expects that product development expenses and data costs will also continue to increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues during the remainder of 2016 and future periods because it expects to employ more development personnel on average compared to prior periods, obtain additional data and build the infrastructure required to support the development of new and improved products and services. However, as these expenditures are largely discretionary in nature, the Company expects that the actual amounts incurred will be in line with its projections of future cash flows in order not to negatively impact its future liquidity and capital needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives within a meaningful time frame.

The Company expects to experience fluctuations in its future quarterly operating results due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside the Company s control. Factors that may adversely affect the Company s quarterly operating results include, among others, (i) the Company s ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers at a steady rate and maintain customer satisfaction, (ii) the Company s ability to maintain gross margins in its existing business and in future product lines and markets, (iii) the development of new services and products by the Company and its competitors, (iv) price competition, (v) the Company s ability to obtain products and services from its vendors, including information suppliers, on commercially reasonable terms, (vi) the Company s ability to upgrade and develop its systems and infrastructure, and adapt to technological change, (vii) the Company s ability to attract and retain personnel in a timely and effective manner, (viii) the Company s ability to manage effectively its development of new business segments and markets, (ix) the Company s ability to successfully manage the integration of operations and technology of acquisitions or other business combinations, (x) technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet brownouts, (xi) the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating the Company s business, operations and infrastructure, (xii) governmental regulation and taxation policies, (xiii) disruptions in service by common carriers due to strikes or otherwise, (xiv) risks of fire or other casualty, (xv) litigation costs or other unanticipated expenses, (xvi) interest rate risks and inflationary pressures, and (xvii) general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the Internet and online commerce.

12 

Index 

Due to the foregoing factors, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future prospects, industry trends, competitive conditions and litigation issues. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.

The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, a future event or otherwise.

Item 4. 
 
    Controls and Procedures

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. In light of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, we completed substantive procedures, including validating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used for accounting for income taxes, prior to filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

These additional procedures have allowed us to conclude that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As of September 30, 2016, we did not maintain effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness, existence, accuracy and presentation and disclosure of our accounting for income taxes, including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities. Specifically, there were errors in the tax accounting for incentive stock options resulting in errors in the calculation of certain deferred tax balances and incorrect balance sheet classification and disclosure of certain balances in the notes to the financial statements. These errors resulted in adjustments to our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The errors arising from the underlying deficiency are not material to the financial statements reported in any interim or annual period. However, this control deficiency could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. Accordingly, we have determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.

Because of this material weakness, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on criteria described in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by COSO.

The Company is evaluating the material weakness and developing a plan of remediation to strengthen our overall internal control over accounting for income taxes. The remediation plan includes implementing additional monitoring controls through revising and formalizing the income tax review processes. The Company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes that these remediation efforts will represent significant improvements in our controls. The Company has started to implement these steps, however, some of these steps will take time to be fully integrated and confirmed to be effective and sustainable. Additional controls may also be required over time. Until these remediation steps are fully implemented and tested, the material weakness described above will continue to exist.

Except as noted above, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
