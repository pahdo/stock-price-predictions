ITEM
1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW    

INTRODUCTION   

PHI
Group, Inc. (the  Company  or  PHI ) is a Nevada corporation engaged in mergers and acquisitions as a
principal ( www.phiglobal.com ). The Company has adopted plans to acquire established operating businesses in selective industries
and invest in various ventures that may potentially create significant long-term value for our shareholders. In addition, we also
provide corporate finance services, including merger and acquisition advisory and consulting services for client companies through
our wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital Holdings, Inc. ( www.phicapitalholdings.com ). No assurances can be made that the
Company will be successful in achieving its plans.  

BACKGROUND   

Originally
incorporated in June 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., the Company was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating
subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated two modeling agencies, one in New York and one in California. Following the
business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based financial services company, the Company changed its
name to Providential Securities, Inc. (Nevada) in January 2000. The Company then changed its name to Providential Holdings, Inc.
in February 2000. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership and ceased its financial
services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October 2000 to October 2011,
the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality
development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare, private equity, and special situations. In October
2011, the Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation
(together with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation - US, and Philand Vietnam Ltd. - Vietnam), PHI
Gold Corporation (formerly PHI Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation), and PHI Energy Corporation (a Nevada corporation), and
began to mainly focus on acquisition and development opportunities in energy and natural resource businesses. Starting July 2016,
the Company has engaged Milost Advisors, Inc., a New York-based investment-banking firm, as its buy-side advisor and begun to
seek acquisition opportunities in other industries besides energy and natural resources. In addition, PHI Capital Holdings, Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, continues to provide corporate and project finance services, including merger and acquisition
(M A) advisory and consulting services for other companies in a variety of industries.  

BUSINESS
STRATEGY   

PHI
Group Inc. s strategy is to:  

1.
Identify, build, acquire, commit and deploy valuable resources with distinctive competitive advantages;  

2.
Identify, evaluate, acquire, participate and compete in attractive businesses that have large, growing market potential;  

3.
Design and implement best-of-breed management systems; and  

4.
Build an attractive investment that includes points of exit for investors through capital appreciation or spin-offs of business
units.

As
of June 30, 2016, the Company owns 100% of PHI Capital Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, 100% of American Pacific Resources,

Biomass Corporation, a Florida corporation, was set up in January 2015 by the Company and the principals of AG Materials, LLC,
an Alabama company, to engage in biomass energy. The Company holds 51% and the principals of AG Materials hold 49% of equity ownership
in Cornerstone Biomass Corporation. This subsidiary s plan was to develop and establish a 200,000 MT wood pellet plant adjacent
to Klausner Lumber Mill in Live Oak, Florida. In July 2015, the Company purchased a 10-acre parcel of land from Klausner Holding
USA Corporation in order to build the wood pellet plant. Due to subsequent changes in market conditions affecting industrial pellet
usage in Europe, Cornerstone Biomass Corp. decided not to pursue this project. The Company has written off its initial investment
in Cornerstone Biomass Corp. as of June 30, 2016 in the amount of $ 2,550 and is in the process of selling the land parcel for
cash.

TANS

Provimex,
Inc. was originally formed on April 10, 2001 under the name  Providential Imex , to focus on trade commerce with Vietnam.
This division changed its name to Provimex on July 5, 2001. Provimex began to generate revenues from its import and export activities
in August 2002 through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and was incorporated as a Nevada corporation on September 23, 2004.
The Company distributed a 15% stock dividend of Provimex, Inc. to PHI Group, Inc. s shareholders of record as of September
15, 2004. On June 3, 2011, Provimex, Inc. signed an agreement to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Humex
Medical Group Corp., a California corporation, ( Humex ) in exchange solely for a certain amount of shares of Provimex s
common stock, par value 0.001, to engage in stem research and therapy in Southeast Asia. On June 13, 2012 this transaction was
rescinded in its entirety effective retroactively June 3, 2011. On June 19, 2012, Provimex, Inc. changed its name to HP.ITA Corporation.
On July 20, 2012, HP.ITA Corporation ( HPUS ) signed a Corporate Combination Agreement to merge with HP.ITA Joint
Stock Company ( HPVN ), a Vietnamese company, in order to go public in the United States but the Corporate Combination
Agreement was subsequently rescinded because HPVN was not able to implement its business plan and complete financial audits according
to the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principals ( GAAP ). On September 16, 2016 HP.ITA Corp. changed its name
to Tans Global, Inc. with the intention to merge with an operating company and file a registration statement with the Securities

Nevada corporation in February 2004 under the name of Touchlink Communications, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
to provide long distance services to residential and business customers in the United States. The Company has declared a 15% stock
dividend of Touchlink Communications, Inc. to shareholders of record as of September 15, 2004. On November 03, 2008, this subsidiary
changed its name to Vietnam Media Group, Inc. with the intent to develop a multi-media business in Vietnam and subsequently resumed

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS    

RISK
FACTORS   

Investment
in our securities is subject to various risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. The following sets
forth factors related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could
cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss.   

General
Risks Related to Our Business    

Our
success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.    

Our
future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management. The loss of the services of
one or more of our key personnel could impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in the failure
to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees. Our future success will also
depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing
our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able to attract, train or
retain qualified personnel in the future.  

Our
strategy in mergers and acquisitions involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions. Even
when an acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive
as management may have projected.    

The
Company is in the process of evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies, assets and technologies.
Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion
of management s attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of
key employees of acquired companies. We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although
potential synergy may be achieved by acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the
Company s ability to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might
be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business, financial condition and operating results.  

Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including:  

failure
    of the acquired business to achieve expected results;   

diversion
    of management s attention;   

failure
    to retain key personnel of the acquired business;   

additional
    financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both;   

the
    potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and   

the
    high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.   

These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of
the securities received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved
in acquisition. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability
to obtain sufficient working capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.  

As
some of our business activities are currently involved with Southeast Asia, any adverse change to the economy or business environment
in these countries could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability   .   

Some
of our business activities are currently involved with Southeast Asia. Because of this presence in specific geographic locations,
we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including stock
market fluctuation. A stagnant or depressed economy in these countries generally, or in any of the other markets that we serve,
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

Risks
associated with energy business    

As
part of our core business involves acquisitions of energy assets as well as production and trading of energy commodities, our
profitability will depend on the prices we receive for energy commodities such as coal and wood pellets. These prices are dependent
upon factors beyond our control, including: the strength of the global economy; the demand for electricity; the global supply
of thermal coal and biomass products; weather patterns and natural disasters; competition within our industry and the availability
and price of alternatives, including natural gas; the proximity, capacity and cost of transportation; coal industry capacity;
domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including those establishing air emission standards for coal-fueled power
plants or mandating increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources; regulatory, administrative and judicial decisions,
including those affecting future mining permits; and technological developments, including those intended to convert coal-to-liquids
or gas and those aimed at capturing and storing carbon dioxide.  

Risks
Related to Our Securities    

Insiders
have substantial control over the company, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, even if our other
stockholders wanted such a change to occur.    

Though
our executive officers and directors as of October 12, 2016, in the aggregate, only hold approximately 27.53% of our outstanding
common stock, our Board of Directors is able to decide the rights and terms associated with the Company s Preferred Stock,
which decision may allow the Board of Directors to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside
party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur.  

The
price at which investors purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the prevailing market price.    

The
stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific
companies whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. Investors may
be unable to sell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses.  

Since
we do not currently meet the requirements for our stock to be quoted on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT LLC or any other senior exchange, the
tradability in our securities will be limited under the penny stock regulations.    

Under
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, if the price of our securities on the OTCQB or OTC Markets is below $5.00
per share, our securities are within the definition of a  penny stock.  As a result, it is possible that our securities
may be subject to the  penny stock  rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of
investors are required to comply with the Commission s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations
require broker-dealers to:  

*Make
a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser;  

*Receive
the purchaser s written consent to the transaction; and  

*Provide
certain written disclosures to the purchaser.  

These
requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability to resell our securities.  

Our
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly
for us.    

It
may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in order
to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal
controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires publicly traded companies to obtain.  

Our
success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.    

Our
future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management and founder. The loss of the
services of one or more of our key personnel could impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in
the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees. Our future success
will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required
for continuing our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able to attract,
train or retain qualified personnel in the future.  

Our
service strategy in merger and acquisition involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions.
Even when an acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive
as management may have projected.    

The
Company is in the process of evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies and technologies. Acquisitions
entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management s
attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees of acquired
companies. We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although potential synergy may
be achieved by acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the Company s ability
to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might be acquired in the
future. Failure to successfully assimilate acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition and operating results.  

Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including:  

failure
    of the acquired business to achieve expected results;   

diversion
    of management s attention;   

failure
    to retain key personnel of the acquired business;   

additional
    financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both;   

the
    potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and   

the
    high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.   

These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of
the securities received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved
in acquisition. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability
to obtain sufficient working capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.

The Board of Directors presently intends to retain any earnings to finance company operations and does not expect to authorize

the 1-for-1,500 reverse split of the Common Stock on the Company s long-term shareholders and reward them for staying with
the Company. On June 6, 2012, the Company s Board of Directors passed a resolution to change the record date for the special
stock dividend to July 31, 2012 and the distribution date to November 30, 2012. The Company has reserved a total of 5,673,327

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

Except
for the audited historical information contained herein, this report specifies forward-looking statements of management of the
Company within the meaning of Section 27a of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
( forward-looking statements ) including, without limitation, forward-looking statements regarding the Company s
expectations, beliefs, intentions and future strategies. Forward-looking statements are statements that estimate the happening
of future events and are not based on historical facts. Forward- looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology, such as  could ,  may ,  will ,  expect ,  shall ,  estimate ,
 anticipate ,  probable ,  possible ,  should ,  continue ,  intend 
or similar terms, variations of those terms or the negative of those terms. The forward-looking statements specified in this report
have been compiled by management of the Company on the basis of assumptions made by management and considered by management to
be reasonable. Future operating results of the Company, however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guaranty, or
warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements. The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements
specified in this report represent estimates of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic,
legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information
and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment.
To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results,
and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. In addition, those forward-looking
statements have been compiled as of the date of this report and should be evaluated with consideration of any changes occurring
after the date of this report. No assurance can be given that any of the assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements
specified in this report are accurate and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.   

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND JUNE 30, 2015   

Revenues:  

The
Company generated $332,050 in revenues from consulting, advisory and management services during the fiscal year ended June 30,

Operating
Expenses:  

The
Company incurred total operating expenses of $464,921 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $433,090 for the year ended
June 30, 2014. This represents an increase of $31,831 or 7.35 % in total operating expenses from the prior year. The increase
was primarily due to a decrease of $8,559 in professional services and an increase of $38,947 in general and administrative expenses.
The Company spent more on advertising expenses during the current year relative to the previous fiscal year.  

Income
(loss) from operations:  

The
Company had a loss from operations of $132,871 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a loss from operations of
$305,912 for the year ended June 30, 2015. This represents a decrease of $173,041 or   56.57% in loss from operations during
the current year as compared to that of the precious year. This was mainly due to the fact that the Company generated $204,872
more in revenues while incurring $31,831 more in total operating expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared
to the corresponding items during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.  

Other
income (expense)  

The
Company had a net other income of $124,873 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to net other expenses of $1,063,003 for
the prior year. This was primarily due to the fact the Company had an interest expense of $267,577, a gain on sale of marketable
securities in the amount of $137,017, and other income in the amount of $255,433 comprising of a reversal of impairment of assets
in the amount of $270,000, a write-off of loans receivable of $9,840, a loss of $2,550 in minority interest, and a miscellaneous
expense of $2,000. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 it had an interest expense of $319,315, a loss on sale of marketable
securities of $45,176, a loss of $25,845 from settlement of debts, and other expense in the amount of $672,667.  

Net
income (loss):  

The
Company had a net loss of $7,998 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $1,368,915 for the year ended June
30, 2015, representing a 99.42% reduction in losses between the two corresponding fiscal years. The net income (loss) per share
based on the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $(0.00)
as compared to $(0.21) for the year ended June 30, 2015.  

CASH
FLOWS   

We
had $2,482 in cash and cash equivalents of as of June 30, 2016, as compared to $10,645 in cash and cash equivalents as of June
30, 2015, respectively.  

Net
cash used in our operating activities was $1,849,010 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used in operating
activities of $1,609,353 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The underlying reasons for the increase in net
cash used in operating activities between the two periods were mainly due to a decrease of $1,360,917 in net loss from operations,
a reduction of $16,134 in the increase in other assets and prepaid expenses, and a decrease of $1,616,798 in accounts payable
and accrued expenses between the current fiscal year and the previous fiscal year.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was $146,959 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as compared to cash provided by investing
activities of $65,557 for the year ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The underlying reasons for the change in net cash provided
by (used in) investing activities between the two fiscal years were primarily due to a deposit of $66,776 for acquisition, a purchase
of land for $82,733, and a write-off of $2,550 from investment in joint venture in the current fiscal year, as compared to a write-off
of $73,043 in receivable from discontinued operations, a net deposit of $4,936 for acquisition, and investment in the amount of
$2,550 in a joint venture during the year ended June 30, 2015, respectively.

activities of $1,523,827 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The underlying reasons for the increase in cash
provided by financing activities during the current fiscal year were mainly due to an increase of $2,085,799 in proceeds from
common stock between the current and the previous fiscal years, offset by a change in accumulative other comprehensive income
(loss) of ($69,078) and a change in accumulated deficit in the amount of ($87,108) in the current fiscal year, as compared to
the prior fiscal year.  

HISTORICAL
FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS:   

SHORT
TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK: In the course of its business, the Company has obtained short-term loans from
individuals and institutional investors and from time to time raised money by issuing restricted common stock of the Company under
the auspices of Rule 144. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had short-term notes payable amounting to $673,660 and $1,342,618
with accrued interest of $2,879,655 and $3,031,152, respectively. These notes bear interest rates ranging from 0% to 36% per annum.
During the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $ 652,041 and $31,500 of principal and $77,850 and $4,956 of interest
on the short-term notes, respectively.  

DUE
TO PREFERRED STOCKHOLDERS: The Company classified $215,000 of preferred stock previously subscribed in one of its long discontinued
subsidiaries as a current liability payable to holders of preferred stock in this subsidiary due to deficiencies in connection
with previous preferred share subscription agreements. This amount was past due as of June 30, 2016.  

The
interest payable to holders of preferred stock of the above-mentioned discontinued subsidiary in the amounts of $413,255 and $387,455
has been included in accrued interest included in account payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015.  

COMPANY S
PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS   

We
will continue to pursue our merger and acquisition program by acquiring all or controlling interests in target companies in a
number of industries, including but not limited to conventional energy, renewables, natural resources, agribusiness, technology,
transportation, education, distribution, mining, oil   gas, financial Services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.  

We
have entered into agreements to acquire majority interests in two liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) companies in Southeast Asia and
have signed letters of intent to acquire a number of target companies in the U.S. and abroad. We intend to continue seeking other
acquisition opportunities in the next twelve months and close those transactions that are feasible in order to build a critical
mass and uplist to a senior national exchange as soon as practical. In addition, we will continue to provide advisory and consulting
services to international clients through our wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital Holdings, Inc.  

FINANCIAL
PLANS   

MATERIAL
CASH REQUIREMENTS: We must raise substantial amounts of capital to fulfill our plan of acquiring energy-related and natural resource
assets as part of our scope of business. We intend to use equity, debt and project financing to meet our capital needs for acquisitions.  

Management
has taken action and formulated plans to strengthen the Company s working capital position and generate sufficient cash
to meet its operating needs through June 30, 2017 and beyond. The working capital cash requirements for the next 12 months are
expected to be generated from operations, sale of marketable securities and additional financing. The Company plans to generate
revenues from its consulting services, merger and acquisition advisory services, and acquisitions of target companies with cash
flows.  

AVAILABLE
FUTURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: In September 2016 the Company  signed an agreement with Milost
Global, Inc., a U.S. private equity firm, for a commitment of up to $100 million to finance the Company s future acquisitions
and provide for working capital needs. Investment in the amount of USD 50 million will be as equity and USD 50 million as loans.
 In addition, the Company may use other sources of funds, including short-term loans and long-term debt and equity financing,
as may be needed. The Company believes it will be able to secure the required capital to implement its business plan; however,
no assurances could be made that management would be successful in achieving its plan.  

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

The
following discussion about PHI Group Inc. s market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  

Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk   

Some
of our acquisition targets and partner companies are located outside of the United States and use currencies other than the U.S.
dollar as the official currencies of those countries. The fluctuations of exchange rates in these countries may affect the value
of our business.  

Interest
Rate Risk   

We
do not have significant interest rate risk, as most of our debt obligations are primarily short-term in nature to individuals,
with fixed interest rates.  

Valuation
of Securities Risk   

Since
majority of our income is paid with the marketable securities, the value of our assets may fluctuate significantly depending on
the market value of the securities we hold.

   INDEX
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To
the Board of Directors and  

  Stockholders
of PHI Group Inc.  

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PHI Group Inc., ( Company ) as of June 30, 2016, and
2015, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the two year period ended June 30, 2016.  

PHI
Group, Inc. s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  

The
company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  

Our
audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of PHI Group, Inc., as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in
the two year period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying financial consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern. As discussed in Note 21, the Company has accumulated deficit of $37,774,842 and total liabilities and stockholders 
deficit of $753,990 as of June 30, 2016, and a negative cash flow from operations amounting to $7,998 for the year ended June
30, 2016. These factors as discussed in Note 21 of the consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Managements  plan in regard to these matters are also described in Note 21. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

principal ( www.phiglobal.com ). The Company has adopted plans to acquire established operating businesses in selective industries
and invest in various ventures that may potentially create significant long-term value for our shareholders. In addition, we also
provide corporate finance services, including merger and acquisition advisory and consulting services for client companies through
our wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital Holdings, Inc. ( www.phicapitalholdings.com ). No assurances can be made that the
Company will be successful in achieving its plans.  

Originally
incorporated in June 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., the Company was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating
subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated two modeling agencies, one in New York and one in California. Following the
business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based brokerage firm, in late 1999, the Company changed
its name to Providential Securities, Inc. (Nevada) in January 2000. The Company then changed its name to Providential Holdings,
Inc. in February 2000. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership and ceased its financial
services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October 2000 to October 2011,
the Company was engaged in mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality development,
mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare, private equity, and special situations. In October 2011, the
Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation, (together
with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation (US), and Philand Vietnam Ltd.), PHI Gold Corporation (formerly
PHI Mining Corporation), and PHI Energy Corporation, and began to mainly focus on acquisition and development opportunities in
energy and natural resource businesses. Starting July 2016, the Company has engaged Milost Advisors, Inc., a New York-based investment-banking
firm, as its buy-side advisor and begun to seek acquisition opportunities in other industries besides energy and natural resources.
In addition, PHI Capital Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, continues to provide corporate and project finance
services, including merger and acquisition (M A) advisory and consulting services and arranging capital for other companies
in a variety of industries.  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION  

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PHI Group, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital Holdings, Inc.,
and its discontinued operations Providential Securities, Inc., PHI Energy Corporation, PHI Gold Corp, Providential Vietnam Ltd.
and Philand Ranch Limited (including its 100% owned subsidiary Philand Corporation and Philand Vietnam Ltd), Omni Resources, Inc.,
Cornerstone Biomass Corp., and American Pacific Resources, Inc., collectively referred to as the  Company.  All significant
inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES  

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

The
Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible
into cash to be cash equivalents.  

MARKETABLE
SECURITIES  

The
Company s securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. Securities classified
as available-for-sale may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and for other purposes.  

Each
investment in marketable securities typically represents less than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock and stock
equivalents of the investee, and each security is nationally quoted on the FINRA S OTC Bulletin Board ( OTCBB )
or the OTC Markets. As such, each investment is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320 (previously SFAS No.
115).  

Unrealized
holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholder s equity. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in earnings
based upon the adjusted cost of the specific security sold. On June 30, 2016 and 2015 the marketable securities have been recorded
at $383,770 and $350,556, respectively based upon the fair value of the marketable securities at that time.  

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE  

Management
reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no accounts
receivable.  

IMPAIRMENT
OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

Effective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted ASC 350 (Previously SFAS 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets ), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes
SFAS No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,  and
the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,  Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a
Segment of a Business.  The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in
accordance with ASC 350. ASC 350 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators
of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets 
carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market
value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair
market values are reduced for the cost of disposal.  

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT  

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred; costs of major additions and
betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to ten years.  

DEPRECIATION
AND AMORTIZATION  

The
cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Depreciation and amortization
of fixed assets are computed on a straight-line basis.  

NET
EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 260 (previously SFAS 128). ASC 260 eliminates the presentation of primary and fully diluted
earnings per share ( EPS ) and requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income
(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and common stock equivalents outstanding
at the end of the period.  

The
net earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows:  

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION  

Effective
July 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718-10-25 (previously SFAS 123R) and accordingly has adopted the modified prospective application
method. Under this method, ASC 718-10-25 is applied to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the
effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards that are outstanding as of the date of adoption for
which the requisite service has not been rendered (such as unvested options) is recognized over a period of time as the remaining
requisite services are rendered.  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Fair
Value - Definition and Hierarchy    

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether
or not the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial
assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement.  

A
fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the
use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs are to be used when available.  

Valuation
techniques that are consistent with the market or income approach are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy is
categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:  

Level
 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the
ability to access.  

Level
 2 - Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.  

Level
3  - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  

Fair
value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant
that are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are
not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment
to investment and are affected by a wide variety of factors, including; type of investment, whether the investment is new and
not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.  

To
the extent that valuation is based upon models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
of fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially
higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. Accordingly, the degree
of judgment exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases,
the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in
the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based upon the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

Fair
Value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs    

The
Company holds and may invest public securities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC), private securities, real
estate, convertible securities, interest bearing securities and other types of securities and has adopted specific techniques
for their respective valuations.  

Equity
Securities in Public Companies   

Unrestricted   

The
Company values investments in securities that are freely tradable and listed on major securities exchanges at their last reported
sales price as of the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied,
they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  

Securities
traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair
value hierarchy.  

Restricted   

Securities
traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) where there are formal restrictions that limit (i.e. Rule 144 holding periods
and underwriter s lock-ups) their sale shall be valued at the closing price on the date of valuation less applicable discounts.
The Company may apply a discount to securities with Rule 144 restrictions. Additional discounts may be assessed if the Company
believes there are other mitigating factors which warrant the additional discounting. When determining potential additional discounts,
factors that will be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to; securities  trading characteristics, volume,
length and overall impact of the restriction as well as other macro-economic factors. Valuations should be discounted appropriately
until the securities may be freely traded.  

If
it has been determined that the exchange or OTC listed price does not accurately reflect fair market value, the Company may elect
to treat the security as a private company and apply an alternative valuation method.  

Investments
in restricted securities of public companies may be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, to the extent that
significant inputs used to determine liquidity discounts are not observable, investments in restricted securities in public companies
may be categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The
Company s financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities,
and accounts payable.  

As
of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying
values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily attributed to the short maturities of these instruments.  

Effective
July 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 (previously SFAS 157),  Fair Value Measurements  and adopted this Statement for
the assets and liabilities shown in the table below. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring
fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about the
use of fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements. ASC 820
permits the Company to defer the recognition and measurement of the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until January
1, 2010. At June 30, 2016, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value. ASC 820 requires that financial assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value be categorized
as one of the types of investments based upon the methodology mentioned in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 above for determining
fair value.  

Assets
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. The Company has no financial liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis.  

Available-for-sale
securities    

The
Company uses various approaches to measure fair value of available-for-sale securities, while applying the three-level valuation
hierarchy for disclosures, specified in ASC 820. Our Level 1 securities were measured using the quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets and liabilities.  

The
company s policy regarding the transfers in and/or out of Level 3 depends on the trading activity of the security, the volatility
of the security, and other observable units which clearly represents the fair value of the security. If a level 3 security can
be measured using a more fairly represented fair value, we will transfer these securities either into Level 1 or Level 2, depending
on the type of inputs.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION  

The
Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 13 (previously Staff accounting bulletin (SAB) 104). The
Company recognizes consulting and advisory fee revenues when the transaction is completed and the service fees are earned. Expenses
are recognized in the period in which the corresponding liability is incurred. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria
for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue.  

ADVERTISING  

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $79,072 and
$4,350, respectively. The increase in advertising expenses in the current year includes expenses for investor relations and public
relations totaling $64,170.  

COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME (LOSS)  

ASC
220-10-45 (previously SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income) establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity, except those
resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, SFAS No. 130 requires that all items
that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial
statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
accumulated other comprehensive incomes of $30,263 and $99,341 are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  

INCOME
TAXES  

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 (previously SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes ).
Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences,
and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when,
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.  

REPORTING
OF SEGMENTS  

ASC
280 (previously Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information),
which supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise,
establishes standards for the way that public enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements
and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements regarding products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. ASC 280 defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which
separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company operated in one segment that generated revenues during the years
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES  

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company provides its service and
receives marketable securities upon execution of transactions. Consequently, the value of the securities received from customers
can be affected by economic fluctuations and each customer s business growth. The actual realized value of these securities
could be significantly different than recorded value.

CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTE:  

On
February 29, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $56,750 to Auctus Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company. This convertible note is due and payable on November 29, 2016 with interest of 10% per annum. This note is
convertible at the election of Auctus Fund, LLC from time to time after the issuance date. In the event of default, the amount
of principal and interest not paid when due bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum and the note becomes immediately due and
payable. Should an event of default occur, the Company is liable to pay 150% of the then outstanding principal and interest. The
note agreement contains covenants requiring Auctus Fund s written consent for certain activities not in existence or not
committed to by the Company on the issuance date of the note, as follows: dividend distributions in cash or shares, stock repurchases,
borrowings, sale of assets, certain advances and loans in excess of $100,000, and certain guarantees with respect to preservation

days prior to the date the of the note. The Company may prepay the amounts outstanding to Auctus Fund at any time up to the 180 th
 day following the issue date of this note by making a payment to the note holder of an amount in cash equal to 125% to 150%,
multiplied by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note  plus  (x) accrued and unpaid interest on
the unpaid principal amount of this Note  plus  (y) Default Interest, depending on the time of prepayment. On August 30,
2016, Auctus Fund, LLC converted the principal amount of $56,750 and $2,829.76 in accrued interest, totaling $59,579.76, into
529,598 shares of free-trading stock of the Company (Note 22 - Subsequent Event).

None.  

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), our management
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the period covered by this
report. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation, our management (including our Chief Executive Officer) concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2015, based on the material weaknesses defined below.  

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control of Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive
and principal financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:  

-  
      pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of
    our assets,   

-  
      provide
    reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
    and directors, and   

-  
      provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of authorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
    that could have a material effect on our financial statements.   

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted
that any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
the Company s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2015 based on the framework set forth in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.  

If
we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately
report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.  

The
material weaknesses related to a lack of a full segregation of duties and to our lack of sufficient personnel in our accounting
and financial reporting functions with sufficient experience and expertise with respect to the application of U.S. GAAP and related
financial reporting.  

Based
on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of June 30, 2016.  

Management s
Remediation Plan   

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered
by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate
such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the future:  

(i)  
       appoint
                                         additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective
                                         risk management; and    

(ii)  
      adopt
    sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.   

The
remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of
implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected
in a material manner. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2016 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.  

Attestation
Report of the Registered Accounting Firm   

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K, which permits the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting have come to management s attention during the
Company s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.
