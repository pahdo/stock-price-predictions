Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

1.  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Aon plc and all of its controlled subsidiaries ("Aon" or the "Company").  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. 
    
  Certain information and disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of operating results that may be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Reclassification 
    
  Certain amounts in prior years' Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.   
    
  Upon vesting of certain share-based payment arrangements, employees may elect to use a portion of the shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements, in which case Aon makes a payment to the taxing authority on the employee s behalf and remits the remaining shares to the employee.   Prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company presented amounts due to taxing authorities within Cash Flows From Operating Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  These amounts are now included in  Issuance of shares for employee benefit plans  within Cash Flows From Financing Activities.  The Company believes this presentation provides greater clarity into the operating and financing activities of the Company as the substance and accounting for these transactions is that of a share repurchase.  It also aligns the Company s presentation to be consistent with industry practice and share-based compensation guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") in March 2016.  The amount reported in Issuance of shares for employee benefit plans was   $220 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This amount, which was reclassified from Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other assets and liabilities, was   $103 million   and   $117 million  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Changes to the presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were made related to certain line items within financing activities.  In 2016, Purchases of shares from noncontrolling interests and Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests have been aggregated in a new line item titled  Noncontrolling interests and other financing activities  within financing activities.  The balances held in these line items for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were outflows of   $5 million   and   $21 million  , respectively.  Additionally, Restructuring reserves have been retrospectively reclassified to Other asset and liabilities.  The balance held in Restructuring reserves for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was an outflow of   $25 million  .  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of reserves and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgments.  Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment.  Management believes its estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available.  Aon adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate.  Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency exchange rate movements increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.  As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.  Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment would, if applicable, be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.

2.  Accounting Principles and Practices 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments.  Under the new guidance, an entity will no longer have discretion to choose the classification for a number of transactions, including contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method investees.  The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted.  An entity will apply the new guidance through retrospective adjustment to all periods presented.  The retrospective approach includes a practical expedient that entities may apply should retrospective adoption be impracticable; in this case, the amendments for these issues may be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  Aon does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact upon the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Credit Losses 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.  The new guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. An entity will apply the new guidance through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  The guidance is effective for Aon in the first quarter of 2020 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019.  Aon is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the method of transition and period of adoption. 
  Share-based Compensation 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and treated as discrete items in the reporting period.  Further, excess tax benefits are required to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity.  Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted.  Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively.  Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively.  An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. The guidance is effective for Aon in the first quarter of 2017 and early adoption is permitted.   
    
  Aon expects to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and is currently evaluating the method of transition.  The Company is also finalizing its evaluation of the impact of the new guidance, specifically the changes to the accounting and presentation of excess tax benefits, which could have a significant impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  This includes Income tax expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income, Additional paid-in capital in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, and Cash Flows from Operating Activities and Cash Flows from Financing Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The impact will be driven by the Company s share price at the time share-based payment transactions vest in future periods.  Specifically, if the Company s share price increases between the date of grant and the vesting date of an equity award, the Company will recognize an income tax benefit, which will lower the effective tax rate. If the Company s share price decreases between the date of grant and the vesting date, the Company will recognize an income tax provision, which will increase the effective tax rate.  The Company does not expect other elements of the guidance to have a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on leases, which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases.  Under the new guidance, a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to  
  
   8 

make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from currently effective U.S. GAAP.  The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019, with early application permitted.  In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. These practical expedients relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date, and the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset.  Aon is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the method of transition and period of adoption. 
  Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.  The amendments in the new guidance make targeted improvements, which include the requirement to measure equity investments with readily determinable fair values at fair value through net income, simplification of the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, adjustments to existing and additional disclosure requirements, and additional tax considerations. An entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the guidance.  The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 and early adoption is permitted.  Aon is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on the its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the method of transition and period of adoption. 
  Presentation of Deferred Taxes 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the balance sheet presentation of deferred taxes, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current.  Aon early adopted this guidance in the second quarter of 2016 and retrospectively applied its requirements to all periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Aon reclassified its current deferred tax positions to non-current and netted the new balances by jurisdiction, which increased Non-current deferred tax assets by   $92 million   and decreased Non-current deferred tax liabilities by   $139 million   on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
    
  Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.  This guidance will also be applied to Aon's debt issuance costs related to its line-of-credit arrangements.  This guidance was effective for Aon in the first quarter of 2016, which required retrospective application to prior year comparable periods.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, Aon reclassified   $4 million   from Other current assets and   $33 million   from Other non-current assets to Long-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  
    
  Consolidations 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on consolidations, which will eliminate the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entities guidance and make targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance. The new guidance applies to all entities involved with limited partnerships or similar entities and requires re-evaluation of these entities under the revised guidance, which could change previous consolidation conclusions.  The guidance was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts with customers, which, when effective, will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or  
  
   9 

fulfill a contract. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 and early adoption is permitted beginning the first quarter of 2017. The guidance permits two methods of transition upon adoption: full retrospective and modified retrospective.  Under the full retrospective method, prior periods would be restated under the new revenue standard, providing a comparable view across all periods presented.  Under the modified retrospective method, prior periods would not be restated.  Rather, revenues and other disclosures for pre-2018 periods would be provided in the notes to the financial statements as previously reported under the current revenue standard.  Aon is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company is also determining the appropriate method of transition to the guidance, but expects to adopt upon the effective date of January 1, 2018. 

3.  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and all highly liquid debt instruments with initial maturities of three months or less.  Short-term investments include certificates of deposit, money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with initial maturities in excess of   three   months but less than   one   year and are carried at amortized cost, respectively, which approximates fair value. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were   $946 million   compared to   $740 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Of the total balances,   $85 million   and   $105 million   was restricted as to its use at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Included within the   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   balances, respectively, were    43.3 million   (  $56.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates) and    43.3 million   (  $64.6 million   at   December 31, 2015   exchange rates) of operating funds required to be held by the Company in the U.K. by the Financial Conduct Authority, a U.K.-based regulator, which were included in Short-term investments.

7.  Debt 
    
  Revolving Credit Facilities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Aon plc had   two   primary committed credit facilities outstanding: its   $400 million   U.S. credit facility expiring in March 2017 (the "2017 Facility") and its   $900 million   multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in February 2021 (the "2021 Facility").   
    
  Each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, including financial covenants that require Aon plc to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly.  At   September 30, 2016  , Aon plc did not have borrowings under either the 2017 Facility or the 2021 Facility, and was in compliance with all covenants contained therein during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

13 

Commercial Paper 
    
  Aon Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon plc, has established a U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for commercial paper to be issued in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $900 million  , and a European multi-currency commercial paper program, which provides for commercial paper to be issued in an aggregate principal amount of up to    300 million  .  The U.S. commercial paper program is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon plc and the European commercial paper program is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon Corporation.  In the aggregate, the Company had   $244 million   and   $50 million   of commercial paper outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The weighted average commercial paper outstanding for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $271 million   and   $251 million  , respectively.  The weighted average interest rate of the commercial paper outstanding for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   0.02%   and   0.27%  , respectively.  
    
  Notes 
    
  On March 1, 2016, Aon plc issued   $750 million   of   3.875%   Senior Notes due December 2025.  The Company used the proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes. 
    
  On May 27, 2016,   $500 million   of   3.125%   Senior Notes due May 2016 issued by Aon Corporation matured and were repaid in full.  

8.  Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate on net income was   13.2%   and   16.1%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The effective tax rate on net income was   14.0%   and   15.8%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   respectively.  The effective tax rate in the   third   quarter of   2016   was impacted by changes in the geographical distribution of income, including a reduction in forecasted U.S. income resulting from non-cash pension expenses expected in Q4, and certain favorable discrete items.  

9.  Shareholders' Equity 
    
  Ordinary Shares 
    
  In April 2012, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which up to   $5.0 billion   of Class A Ordinary Shares may be repurchased (the "2012 Share Repurchase Program").  In November 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new   $5.0 billion   share repurchase program in addition to the existing program (the "2014 Share Repurchase Program" and, together, the "Repurchase Programs"). Under each program, shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital. 
    
  In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   2.7 million   shares at an average price per share of   $110.26   for a total cost of approximately   $301 million   under the Repurchase Programs.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   10.4 million   shares at an average price per share of   $101.16   for a total cost of approximately   $1.1 billion   under the Repurchase Programs. Included in the   2.7 million   shares and   10.4 million   shares repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   128 thousand   shares that did not settle until October 2016.  These shares were settled at an average price per share of   $112.00   and total cost of   $14.3 million  .  In the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased   6.3 million   shares at an average price per share of   $95.75   for a total cost of approximately   $600 million  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased   11.7 million   shares at an average price per share of   $98.00   for a total cost of   $1.15 billion  . In August 2015, the   $5 billion   of Class A Ordinary Shares authorized under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program was exhausted. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program was   $3.0 billion  .  Under the Repurchase Programs, the Company has repurchased a total of   88.4 million   shares for an aggregate cost of approximately   $7.0 billion  .

Net Income Per Share 
    
  Weighted average shares outstanding are as follows (in millions): 

Certain ordinary share equivalents may be excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion would be antidilutive. There were   no   shares excluded from the calculation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and no shares excluded from the calculation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of related tax, are as follows (in millions): 

(1) Reclassifications from this category included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are recorded in   Other income  ,   Other general expenses  , and   Compensation and benefits  .  See Note 12 "Derivatives and Hedging" for additional information regarding the Company's derivative and hedging activity. 
  (2) Reclassifications from this category included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are recorded in Compensation and benefits. 
  In March 2016, the Company entered into an insurance contract that covers a portion of the assets within select U.K. pension schemes. The transaction resulted in a decrease in Prepaid pension assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income of   $267 million   as the fair value in the insurance policies was deemed to be the present value of the current obligation.

10.  Employee Benefits 
    
  The following table provides the components of the net periodic (benefit) cost recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in Compensation and benefits for Aon's material U.K., U.S., and other significant international pension plans located in the Netherlands and Canada (in millions): 

Beginning in 2016, the Company has elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost for Aon's major pension and other post-retirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. In 2015 and prior years, the Company estimated these components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost by applying a single weighted-average discount rate, derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.  The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.  This change does not affect the measurement of the projected benefit obligation as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss recorded in other comprehensive income.  The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively.  
    
  In March 2016, the Company announced a plan to offer a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible former employees under one of the Company s U.K. pension plans, that if accepted, would settle the Company s pension obligations to them.  The lump sum cash payment offer closed during the second quarter of 2016. In total, lump sum payments from plan assets of    116 million   (  $159 million   using June 30, 2016 exchange rates) were paid.  As a result of this settlement, the Company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the U.K. pension plan during the second quarter of 2016, which in aggregate resulted in a net reduction to the projected benefit obligation of    103 million   (  $141 million   using June 30, 2016 exchange rates) as well as a non-cash settlement charge of    42 million   (  $61 million   using average June 2016 exchange rate) in the second quarter of 2016.

In August 2016, the Company announced a plan to offer a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible former employees under one of the Company's U.S. pension plans, that if accepted, would settle the Company's pension obligations to them.  As of September 30, 2016, the offer was still open and a settlement charge is expected in the fourth quarter.  
    
  Contributions 
    
  The Company expects to contribute approximately   $79 million  ,   $54 million  , and   $17 million  , based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, to its significant U.K., U.S., and other significant international pension plans, respectively, during 2016. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , contributions of   $19 million  ,   $5 million  , and   $4 million   were made to the Company's significant U.K., U.S., and other significant international pension plans, respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , contributions of   $53 million  ,   $24 million  , and   $14 million   were made to the Company's significant U.K., U.S., and other significant international pension plans, respectively.  
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , contributions of   $16 million  ,   $41 million  , and   $3 million   were made to the Company's significant U.K., U.S., and other significant international pension plans, respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , contributions of   $50 million  ,   $103 million  , and   $11 million   were made to the Company's significant U.K., U.S., and other significant international pension plans, respectively.  

11.  Share-Based Compensation Plans 
    
  The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in Compensation and benefits (in millions):      

Restricted Share Units 
    
  A summary of the status of the Company's RSUs is as follows (shares in thousands): 

(1) 
    Represents per share weighted-average fair value of award at date of grant. 
       
  Performance Share Awards 
    
  The vesting of PSAs is contingent upon meeting a cumulative level of earnings per share performance over a   three  -year period. The performance conditions are not considered in the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards. The fair value of PSAs is based upon the market price of an Aon ordinary share at the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period based on management's estimate of the number of awards expected to vest. Compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares issued at the end of the programs. The actual issue of shares may range from   0  -  200%   of the target number of PSAs granted, based on the terms of the plan and level of achievement of the related performance target. Dividend equivalents are not paid on PSAs. 

17 

Information as of   September 30, 2016   regarding the Company's target PSAs granted and shares that would be issued at current performance levels for PSAs granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, is as follows (shares in thousands, dollars in millions, except fair value): 

Share Options 
    
  The Company did not grant any share options during either the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .     
    
  A summary of the status of the Company's share options and related information is as follows (shares in thousands): 

The weighted average remaining contractual life, in years, of outstanding options was   2.2   years and   2.6   years at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on options with an exercise price less than the Company's closing share price of   $112.49   as of   September 30, 2016  , which would have been received by the option holders had those option holders exercised their options as of that date.  At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, all of which were exercisable, was   $39 million  . 
     
  Other information related to the Company's share options is as follows (in millions): 

Unamortized deferred compensation expense, which includes both options and RSUs, amounted to   $416 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , with a remaining weighted-average amortization period of approximately   2.1   years.

12.  Derivatives and Hedging 
    
  The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  To manage the risk related to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative instruments that reduce these risks by creating offsetting exposures.  The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Foreign Exchange Risk Management 
    
  The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk when it earns revenues, pays expenses, enters into monetary intercompany transfers denominated in a currency that differs from its functional currency, or enters into other transactions that are denominated in a currency other than its functional currency.  The Company uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts, options and cross currency swaps, to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.  These exposures are hedged, on average, for less than   two   years.  These derivatives are accounted for as hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded each period in Other comprehensive income (loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
    
  The Company also uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts and options, to economically hedge the currency exposure of the Company's global liquidity profile, including monetary assets or liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency of an entity, typically on a rolling   30   day basis, but may be for up to   one   year in the future. These derivatives are not accounted for as hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded each period in Other income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  The notional and fair values of derivative instruments are as follows (in millions): 

(3) 
    These contracts typically are for   30   day durations are executed close to the last day of the most recent reporting month, thereby resulting in nominal fair values at the balance sheet date. 
       
  Offsetting of financial assets and derivatives assets are as follows (in millions): 

(1) Included within Other current assets (  $4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $6 million   at   December 31, 2015  ) or Other non-current assets (  $10 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $13 million   at   December 31, 2015  ).

The Company estimates that approximately   $11 million   of pretax losses currently included within Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months. 
    
  The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income on the ineffective portion of derivatives for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was insignificant. 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a gain of   $2 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, in   Other income   for foreign exchange derivatives not designated or qualifying as hedges. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a gain of   $15 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, in Other income for foreign exchange derivatives not designated or qualifying as hedges. 
  
   20 

Net Investments in Foreign Operations Risk Management 
    
  The Company uses non-derivative financial instruments to protect the value of its investments in a number of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in June 2016, the Company designated its Euro-denominated commercial paper issuances as a non-derivative hedge of a net investment in its European operations. The change in the carrying value of the designated portion of the Euro-denominated commercial paper due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in Foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the hedged net investments that is also recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the period of change. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has    217 million   (  $244 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates) of outstanding Euro-denominated commercial paper designated as a hedge of its net investment in its European operations.  The weighted average commercial paper outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was    217 million   and since inception of the hedge was    177 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the associated gain recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was   $1 million  . 
    
  The Company did not reclassify any deferred gains or losses related to net investment hedges from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, the Company did not have any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the   three and nine   ended   September 30, 2016  . 

13.  Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments 
    
  Accounting standards establish a three tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as follows: 

Level 1   observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets; 
                
    Level 2   inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
                
    Level 3   unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires the use of valuation techniques and the development of assumptions. 
       
  The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of the Company's financial instruments: 
    
  Money market funds   are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Based on market convention, the Company considers cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value. 
    
  Equity investments   consist of domestic and international equity securities valued using the closing stock price on a national securities exchange. The Company reviews the listing of Level 1 equity securities in the portfolio and agrees the closing stock prices to a national securities exchange, and on a sample basis, independently verifies the observable inputs for Level 2 equity securities. 
    
  Fixed income investments   consist of corporate and government bonds. Corporate and government bonds are valued by pricing vendors who estimate fair value using recently executed transactions and proprietary models based on observable inputs, such as interest rate spreads, yield curves and credit risk. The Company obtains a detailed understanding of the models, inputs, and assumptions used in developing prices provided by its vendors. This understanding includes discussions with valuation resources at the vendor. During these discussions, the Company uses a fair value measurement questionnaire, which is part of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, to obtain the information necessary to assert the model, inputs and assumptions used to comply with U.S. GAAP, including disclosure requirements. The Company also obtains observable inputs from the pricing vendor and independently verifies the observable inputs, as well as assesses assumptions used for reasonableness based on relevant market conditions and internal Company guidelines. If an assumption is deemed unreasonable, based on the Company's guidelines, it is then reviewed by management and the fair value estimate provided by the vendor is adjusted, if deemed appropriate. These adjustments do not occur frequently and have historically not been material to the fair value estimates used in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

21 

Derivatives   are carried at fair value, based upon industry standard valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced pricing inputs, such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, or implied volatilities. 
    
  Debt   is carried at outstanding principal balance, less any unamortized discount or premium. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or estimates using discounted cash flow analyses based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
    
  The following tables present the categorization of the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions):

  There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value hierarchy levels in either the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . The Company recognized no realized or unrealized gains or losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during either the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  , related to assets and liabilities measured at fair value using unobservable inputs.

The fair value of Long-term debt is classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table discloses the Company's financial instruments where the carrying amounts and fair values differ (in millions): 

14.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal 
    
  Aon and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which frequently include errors and omissions ("E O") claims.  The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages.  While Aon maintains meaningful E O insurance and other insurance programs to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters, Aon has exhausted or materially depleted its coverage under some of the policies that protect the Company and, consequently, is self-insured or materially self-insured for some claims.  Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and have been recognized in Other general expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable.  These amounts are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant.  Matters that are not probable and reasonably estimable are not accrued for in the financial statements.   
    
  We have included in the matters described below certain matters in which (1) loss is probable, (2) loss is reasonably possible; that is, more than remote but not probable, or (3) there exists the reasonable possibility of loss greater than the accrued amount. In addition, we may from time to time disclose matters for which the probability of loss could be remote but the claim amounts associated with such matters are potentially significant. The reasonably possible range of loss for the matters described below, in excess of amounts that are deemed probable and estimable and therefore already accrued, is estimated to be between   $0   and   $0.2 billion  , exclusive of any insurance coverage.  These estimates are based on currently available information.  As available information changes, the matters for which Aon is able to estimate may change, and the estimates themselves may change.  In addition, many estimates involve significant judgment and uncertainty.  For example, at the time of making an estimate, Aon may only have limited information about the facts underlying the claim, and predictions and assumptions about future court rulings and outcomes may prove to be inaccurate.  Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of all matters described below, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or other events.  Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary or punitive damages imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries. If unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur, future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  Current Matters 
    
  A retail insurance brokerage subsidiary of Aon was sued on September 14, 2010 in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, Twentieth Judicial District, at Nashville by a client, Opry Mills Mall Limited Partnership ("Opry Mills") that sustained flood damage to its property in May 2010.  The lawsuit seeks   $200 million   in coverage from numerous insurers with whom this Aon subsidiary placed the client's property insurance coverage.  The insurers contend that only   $50 million   in coverage (which has already been paid) is available for the loss because the flood event occurred on property in a high hazard flood zone.  Opry Mills is seeking full coverage from the insurers for the loss and has sued this Aon subsidiary in the alternative for the same   $150 million   difference on various theories of professional liability if the court determines there is not full coverage. In addition, Opry Mills seeks prejudgment interest, attorneys' fees and enhanced damages which could substantially increase Aon's exposure. In March 2015, the trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs  
  and against the insurers, holding generally that the plaintiffs are entitled to   $200 million   in coverage under the language of the policies.  In August 2015, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Opry Mills and against the insurers in the amount of   $204 million  .  The insurers have appealed both of these trial court decisions.  Aon believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  
    
  A pensions consulting and administration subsidiary of Hewitt before its acquisition by Aon provided advisory services to the trustees of the Philips UK pension fund and the relevant employer of fund beneficiaries.  On January 2, 2014, Philips Pension Trustees Limited and Philips Electronics UK Limited (together, "Philips") sued Aon in the High Court, Chancery Division, London alleging negligence and breach of duty.  The proceedings assert Philips' right to claim damages related to Philips' use of a credit default swap hedging strategy pursuant to the supply of the advisory services, which is said to have resulted in  
  
   23 

substantial damages to Philips.  Philips sought approximately    189 million   (  $245 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates), plus interest and costs.  In June 2015, the High Court ordered Philips to clarify several aspects of its claim.  In its clarification, Philips increased the amount of its claim to    290 million   (  $376 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates), plus interest and costs.  In October 2016, all parties reached an agreement to settle this case (subject only to negotiating the terms of a final, written agreement).  The terms of this settlement will not have a material impact on Aon's results of operations or financial condition. 
    
  On June 1, 2007, the International Road Transport Union ("IRU") sued Aon in the Geneva Tribunal of First Instance in Switzerland. IRU alleges, among other things, that, between 1995 and 2004, a business acquired by Aon and, later, an Aon subsidiary (1) accepted commissions for certain insurance placements that violated a fee agreement entered between the parties and (2) negligently failed to ask certain insurance carriers to contribute to the IRU's risk management costs.  IRU sought damages of approximately CHF   46 million   (  $47 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates) and   $3 million  , plus legal fees and interest of approximately   $30 million  .  On December 2, 2014, the Geneva Tribunal of First Instance entered a judgment that accepted some, and rejected other, of IRU's claims.  The judgment awarded IRU CHF   16.8 million   (  $17 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates) and   $3.1 million  , plus interest and adverse costs.  The entire amount of the judgment, including interest through December 31, 2014, totaled CHF   27.9 million   (  $29 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates) and   $5 million  .  On January 26, 2015, in return for IRU agreeing not to appeal the bulk of its dismissed claims, the Aon subsidiary agreed not to appeal a part of the judgment and to pay IRU CHF   12.8 million   (  $14 million   at   January 31, 2015   exchange rates) and   $4.7 million   without Aon admitting liability. The Aon subsidiary appealed those aspects of the judgment it retained the right to appeal. IRU did not appeal. The Geneva Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of  the Geneva Tribunal of First Instance. The Aon subsidiary filed an appeal to the Swiss Supreme Court. The Aon subsidiary's maximum liability on appeal is limited to CHF   8.7 million   (  $9 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates) and   $115,000   (plus interest and costs) beyond what the subsidiary has already paid. 
    
  A pensions consulting and administration subsidiary of Aon provided advisory services to the Trustees of the Gleeds pension fund in the United Kingdom and, on occasion, to the relevant employer of the fund.  In April 2014, the High Court, Chancery Division, London found that certain governing documents of the fund that sought to alter the fund's benefit structure and that had been drafted by Aon were procedurally defective and therefore invalid.  No lawsuit naming Aon as a party has been filed, although a tolling agreement has been entered.  The High Court decision says that the additional liabilities in the pension fund resulting from the alleged defect in governing documents amount to approximately    45 million   (  $58 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates).  In December 2014, the Court of Appeal granted the employer leave to appeal the High Court decision. At a hearing in October 2016, the Court of Appeal approved a settlement of the pending litigation.  The fund actuary must still calculate the cost of the settlement to the fund in light of, among other things, changed market conditions since the original High Court judgment in 2014.  The tolling agreement with Aon remains in place.  Aon believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against this potential claim. 
    
  On June 29, 2015, Lyttelton Port Company Limited ("LPC") sued Aon New Zealand in the Christchurch Registry of the High Court of New Zealand.  LPC alleges, among other things, that Aon was negligent and in breach of contract in arranging LPC s property insurance program for the period covering June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011.  LPC contends that acts and omissions by Aon caused LPC to recover less than it otherwise would have from insurers for losses suffered in the 2010/2011 Canterbury Earthquakes.  LPC claims damages of approximately   NZD 184 million   (  $134 million   at   September 30, 2016   exchange rates) plus interest and costs.  Aon believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. 
    
  In addition, from time to time, Aon's clients may bring claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of fiduciary responsibilities. Whether client claims and legal action related to the Company's performance of fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are resolved in a manner unfavorable to the Company, they may adversely affect Aon's financial results and materially impair the market perception of the Company and that of its products and services. 
    
  Guarantees and Indemnifications 
    
  In connection with the redomicile of Aon's headquarters (the "Redomestication"), the Company on April 2, 2012 entered into various agreements pursuant to which it agreed to guarantee the obligations of its subsidiaries arising under issued and outstanding debt securities. Those agreements included the (1) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of April 2, 2012, among Aon Corporation, Aon plc, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee") (amending and restating the Indenture, dated as of September 10, 2010, between Aon Corporation and the Trustee), (2) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of April 2, 2012, among Aon Corporation, Aon plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated as of December 16, 2002, between Aon Corporation and the Trustee), (3) Amended and  
  
   24 

Restated Indenture, dated as of April 2, 2012, among Aon Corporation, Aon plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated as of January 13, 1997, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 13, 1997), and (4) First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 2, 2012, among Aon Finance N.S. 1, ULC, as issuer, Aon Corporation, as guarantor, Aon plc, as guarantor, and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as trustee. 
    
  The Company provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated amounts payable are included in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and are recorded at fair value. 
    
  The Company expects that, as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time.   
    
  Letters of Credit 
    
  The Company had total letters of credit ("LOCs") outstanding of approximately   $91 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $58 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  These letters of credit cover the beneficiaries related to certain of Aon's U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for the Company's own workers compensation program.  The Company has also issued LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at its international subsidiaries.  
    
  Commitments 
    
  The Company has provided commitments to fund certain limited partnerships in which it has an interest in the event that the general partners request funding.  Some of these commitments have specific expiration dates and the maximum potential funding under these commitments was   $10 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $12 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the company   funded     $2 million   of these commitments.  
    
  Premium Payments 
    
  The Company has certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately   $82 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $104 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 

15. Segment Information 
    
  The Company has   two   reportable segments:  Risk Solutions and HR Solutions.  Unallocated income and expenses, when combined with the operating segments and after the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses, equal the amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Reportable operating segments have been determined using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which Aon's chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") uses financial information for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance.  The CODM assesses performance based on operating income and generally accounts for inter-segment revenue as if the revenue were from third parties and at what management believes are current market prices.  The Company does not present net assets by segment as this information is not reviewed by the CODM. 
    
  Risk Solutions acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, via consultation, as well as negotiation and placement of insurance risk with insurance carriers through Aon's global distribution network. 
    
  HR Solutions partners with organizations to solve their most complex benefits, talent and related financial challenges, and improve business performance by designing, implementing, communicating and administering a wide range of human capital, retirement, investment management, health care, compensation and talent management strategies. 

25 

Aon's total revenue is as follows (in millions): 

Commissions, fees and other revenues by product are as follows (in millions): 

Fiduciary investment income by segment is as follows (in millions): 

A reconciliation of segment operating income before tax to income before income taxes is as follows (in millions): 

Unallocated expenses include administrative or other costs not attributable to the reportable segments, such as corporate governance costs. Interest income represents income earned primarily on operating cash balances and certain income producing securities. Interest expense represents the cost of debt obligations. 
    
  Other income consists of equity earnings, realized gains or losses on the sale of investments, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, gains or losses on derivatives, and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions.

16.  Guarantee of Registered Securities 
    
  As described in Note 14, in connection with the Redomestication, Aon plc entered into various agreements pursuant to which it agreed to guarantee the obligations of Aon Corporation arising under issued and outstanding debt securities, including the   5.00%   Notes due September 2020, the   8.205%   Notes due January 2027 and the   6.25%   Notes due September 2040. Aon Corporation is a   100%   indirectly owned subsidiary of Aon plc. All guarantees of Aon plc are full and unconditional. There are no other subsidiaries of Aon plc that are guarantors of the debt. In addition, Aon Corporation entered into an agreement pursuant to which it agreed to guarantee the obligations of Aon plc arising under the   4.250%   Notes due 2042 exchanged for Aon Corporation's outstanding   8.205%   Notes due January 2027 and also agreed to guarantee the obligations of Aon plc arising under the   2.8%   Notes due 2021, the   4.45%   Notes due 2043, the   4.00%   Notes due November 2023, the   2.875%   Notes due May 2026, the   3.50%   Notes due June 2024, the   4.60%   Notes due June 2044, the   4.75%   Notes due May 2045, and the   3.875%   Notes due December 2025. In each case, the guarantee of Aon Corporation is full and unconditional. There are no subsidiaries of Aon plc, other than Aon Corporation, that are guarantors of the   4.250%   Notes due 2042, the   4.45%   Notes due 2043, the   4.00%   Notes due 2023, the   2.875%   Notes due 2026, the   3.50%   Notes due 2024, the   4.60%   Notes due 2044, or the   4.75%   Notes due 2045. As a result of the existence of these guarantees, the Company is required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X to present the financial information set forth in this footnote. 
    
  The following tables set forth condensed consolidating statements of income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , condensed consolidating statements of financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in accordance with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The condensed consolidating financial information includes the accounts of Aon plc, the accounts of Aon Corporation, and the combined accounts of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. The condensed consolidating financial statements are presented in all periods as a merger under common control, with Aon plc presented as the parent company in all periods prior and subsequent to the Redomestication. The principal consolidating adjustments are to eliminate the investment in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions. 
    
  In January 2015, Aon plc transferred its ownership of all of its directly held subsidiaries to Aon Global Holdings Limited, an intermediate holding company.  The financial results of Aon Global Holdings Limited are included in the Other Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries column of the Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements. The Company has reflected the transfer of Aon Corporation from Aon plc to Aon Global Holdings Limited below for all periods presented.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF   THIRD   QUARTER   2016   FINANCIAL RESULTS 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we continued to face certain headwinds that adversely impacted our business in prior periods. These headwinds included a negative market impact in our Reinsurance business in Risk Solutions and fragile macroeconomic conditions in various regions globally. 
    
  The following is a summary of our   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   financial results: 

For the   third   quarter of   2016  , revenue   increased     $4 million   to   $2.7 billion   compared to the prior year period due primarily to organic revenue growth of   4%  , which was offset by a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and a   2%   decrease in commissions and fees related to divestitures, net of acquisitions. For the first   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenue   decreased     1%   compared to the prior year period due primarily to a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and a   2%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures, partially offset by organic revenue growth of   3%  .  In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   was driven by strong organic growth in Retail brokerage, including growth in both the Americas and International businesses, as well as modest growth in Reinsurance compared to the prior year periods.  The HR Solutions segment had strong organic growth in both Consulting and Outsourcing for the   third   quarter and modest organic revenue growth for the first   nine   months when compared to the prior year periods. 

Operating expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $2.3 billion  ,   a decrease   of   $5 million   compared to the prior year period. The   decrease   was primarily due to a $50 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $41 million decrease in expenses related to divestitures, net of acquisitions, and a $6 million decrease in intangible asset amortization, partially offset by an increase in expense to support   4%   organic revenue growth, an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses in the Risk Solutions segment, an increase in errors and omissions expenses, and $7 million of certain legacy information technology contract costs.  Operating expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016     decreased   by   $236 million   compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $181 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, a $176 million decrease in expense related to certain legacy litigation settlements in the prior year period, a $134 million decrease in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and a $30 million decrease in intangible asset amortization, partially offset by a $62 million increase in expense related to certain pension settlements, $20 million of transaction and portfolio repositioning related costs in HR Solutions associated with the sale of certain businesses, an increase in expense to support the   3%   organic growth, and $7 million of certain legacy information technology contract costs. 

Cash flow   provided by   operating activities was   $1,475 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $180 million   from   $1,295 million     provided by   operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The   increase   was driven by lower pension contributions, an increase in net income, underlying working capital improvements, and lower cash tax payments.  

Subsequent to the close of the quarter, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Stroz Friedberg, a leading global risk management firm, strengthening Aon Risk Solutions' ability to serve clients as the global leader in cyber risk mitigation.   Aon expects to recognize approximately $6 million in transaction costs related to this acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016.

We focus on four key non-GAAP metrics that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue, adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow.  These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for the   third   quarter of   2016  : 

Organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results   Organic Revenue," was   4%   for the   third   quarter and   3%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , an increase over 2% organic growth in the prior year   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  .  In both periods, Risk Solutions organic revenue growth was driven by strong growth in Retail brokerage across both the Americas and International businesses, as well as modest growth in Reinsurance organic revenue.  HR Solutions had strong organic revenue growth in both Consulting and Outsourcing for the   third   quarter and modest organic revenue growth for the first   nine   months of   2016  . 

Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results   Adjusted Operating Margin," was   18.0%   for Aon overall,   20.9%   for the Risk Solutions segment, and   17.1%   for the HR Solutions segment for the   third   quarter   2016  .  Adjusted operating margin was   17.9%   for Aon overall,   20.8%   for the Risk Solutions segment, and   17.4%   for the HR Solutions segment for the   third   quarter   2015  . For the first   nine   months of   2016  , adjusted operating margin was   18.6%   for Aon overall,   23.4%   for the Risk Solutions segment, and   14.0%   for the HR Solutions operating segment. For the first   nine   months of   2015  , adjusted operating margin was   18.4%   for Aon overall,   22.8%   for the Risk Solutions segment, and   14.7%   for the HR Solutions segment. The increase in adjusted operating margin for the Risk Solutions segment in the   third   quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year quarter primarily reflects organic revenue growth of   3%  , an 80 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, and a return on investments in data and analytics, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a 50 basis point unfavorable impact from an increase in errors and omissions expenses. The increase in adjusted operating margin for the Risk Solutions segment for the first   nine   months 2016 as compared to the prior year period primarily reflects organic revenue growth of   3%  , a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, and a return on investments in data and analytics, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses.  In the HR Solutions segment in the   third   quarter of   2016  , the operating margin decline compared to the prior year quarter was primarily driven by a 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activity, a 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to certain legacy information technology contract costs, and a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by organic revenue growth of   4%  . For the first   nine   months of   2016  , the decrease in adjusted operating margin as compared to the prior year period in the HR Solutions segment was primarily driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, an unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activity, and certain legacy information technology contract costs, partially offset by organic growth of   3%  .   

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from net income attributable to Aon's shareholders, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results   Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share," was   $1.29   per share in the   third   quarter and   $4.04   per share in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $1.24   per share in the   third   quarter and   $3.92   per share in the first   nine   months of   2015  .    

Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results   Free Cash Flow,"   increased   in the first   nine   months of 2016   $252 million  , or   24%  , to   $1,322 million   from the prior year period, driven by a   $180 million   increase in cash flow from operations and   a decrease   of   $72 million   in capital expenditures.

REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
    
  Summary of Results 
    
  Our consolidated results of operations follow (in millions): 

Revenue 
    
  Total revenue   increased   by   $4 million   in the   third   quarter   2016   compared to the   third   quarter   2015  .  This change resulted from a   $26 million     increase   in Risk Solutions and a   $23 million     decrease   in HR Solutions, excluding intersegment eliminations.  The results of the Risk Solutions segment reflected   3%   organic growth in commissions and fees and a   1%   increase in fees and commissions related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  The decrease in HR Solutions revenue was driven by a   4%   decrease in fees and commissions related to net divestitures and a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by   4%   organic revenue growth. 
    
  First the first   nine   months of   2016  , revenue   decreased     1%  , or   $90 million  , compared to the prior year period. This change consists of a   $17 million     increase   in the Risk Solutions segment and a   $111 million     decrease   in the HR Solutions segment.  The results of the Risk Solutions segment reflected   3%   organic growth in commissions and fees, partially offset by a   3%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. The   decrease   in HR Solutions revenue was driven by a   5%   decrease in fees and commissions related to net divestitures and a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by   3%   organic growth. 
    
  Compensation and Benefits 
    
  Compensation and benefits   decreased     $33 million  , or   2%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter   2015  .  This   decrease   was primarily driven by a $34 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and a $27 million decrease in expenses related to net divestitures, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with   4%   organic revenue growth and the unfavorable timing of certain compensation expenses in the Risk Solutions segment. 
    
  Compensation and benefits   decreased     $32 million   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily driven by a $126 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and an $88 million favorable impact related to net divestitures, partially offset by a $62 million increase in expenses related to certain pension settlements, $20 million of transaction and portfolio repositioning costs primarily associated with the sale of certain businesses, and an increase in expense to support 3% organic growth.

Other General Expenses 
    
  Other general expenses in the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     $28 million  , or   4%  , compared to the   third   quarter   2015  .  This   increase   was due primarily to an increase in expense to support   4%   organic revenue growth, an increase in errors and omissions expenses, and $7 million of certain legacy information technology contract costs, partially offset by a $16 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, a $14 million decrease in expenses related to net divestitures, and a $6 million decrease in intangible asset amortization.  
    
  Other general expenses in the first   nine   months of   2016     decreased     $204 million  , or   9%  , compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  .  This   decrease   was due primarily to a $176 million decrease in expense related to certain legacy litigation settlements in the prior year quarter, a $55 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, a $46 million decrease in expenses related to net divestitures, and a $30 million decrease in intangible asset amortization, partially offset by an increase in expense to support   3%   organic revenue growth and $7 million of certain legacy information technology contract costs. 
    
  Interest Income 
    
  Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments.  It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients.  During the   third   quarter   2016  , Interest income decreased   $2 million   to   $1 million   compared to the   third   quarter   2015  . For the first   nine   months of   2016  , Interest income   decreased     $4 million   to   $6 million   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  .  
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations,   decreased     $2 million   during the   third   quarter   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   and   increased     $7 million   during the first   nine   months compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The increase in interest expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   is due to the overlap of $750 million of notes issued in the first quarter of 2016 for notes that matured in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Other Income 
    
  Other income   was   $9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .    Other income   for both the   third   quarter of   2016   includes net gains on certain long-term investments.  Other income of $8 million in the third quarter 2015 primarily includes $16 million of foreign currency remeasurement gains, partially offset by losses on certain long-term investments. 
    
  Other income   was   $27 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $51 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  .    Other income   for the first   nine   months of   2016   includes   $41 million   of gains on the sale of certain businesses, partially offset by a   $14 million   foreign currency remeasurement net losses.    Other income   of   $51 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily includes   $20 million   of gains on the sale of businesses, and   $33 million   of foreign currency remeasurement net gains. 
    
  Income before Income Taxes 
    
  Income before income taxes for the   third   quarter of 2016 was   $362 million  , a   3%     increase   from   $352 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Income before income taxes for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $1,098 million  , an   11%     increase   from   $987 million   from the first   nine   months of   2015  .  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate on net income was   13.2%   and   14.0%   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective tax rate on net income was   16.1%   and   15.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was impacted by changes in the geographical distribution of income, including a reduction in forecasted U.S. income resulting from non-cash pension expenses expected in Q4, and certain discrete items.

Net Income Attributable to Aon Shareholders    
    
  Net income attributable to Aon shareholders for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   to   $307 million  , or   $1.14   per diluted share, from   $295 million  , or   $1.04   per diluted share, in the prior year period. Net income attributable to Aon shareholders for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased to   $894 million  , or   $3.30   per diluted share, from   $801 million  , or   $2.80   per diluted share, in the prior year period.  
    
  Non-GAAP Metrics 
    
  In our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results.  This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  
    
  Organic Revenue 
    
  We use supplemental information related to organic revenue to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations.  Organic revenue is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intersegment and intrasegment activity and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, fiduciary investment income, and reimbursable expenses.  This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.  Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure, organic revenue growth percentages, to the reported Commissions, fees, have been provided under the "Review by Segment" caption below. 
    
  Adjusted Operating Margin 
    
  We use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions segments.  Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, including intangible asset amortization, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. 
    
   A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported operating margin is as follows (in millions): 

42 

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share 
    
  We use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization, along with related income taxes, because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  
    
  The effective tax rates used in the U.S. GAAP financial statements were   13.2%   and 14.0% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   16.1%   and 15.8% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with non-cash pension expenses, the adjusted effective tax rates for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2016 were 18.2% and 18.0%, respectively. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for legacy litigation, the adjusted effective tax rates for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2015 were 16.0% and 17.8%, respectively.

Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure to the reported diluted earnings per share are as follows (in millions, except per share data):

Free Cash Flow 
    
  We use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance.  This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.  The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures.   
    
  A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions): 

Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations 
    
  Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business.  Foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income.  Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results.  The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year quarter's revenue, expenses, and net income using the current quarter's foreign exchange rates.   

45 

Translating prior year quarter results at current quarter foreign exchange rates, currency fluctuations had   a favorable impact of approximately $0.02   and   an unfavorable impact of $0.03   on net income per diluted share during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   an unfavorable impact of $0.08   and   $0.29   on adjusted net income per diluted share during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Currency fluctuations had   a favorable impact of $0.01   and   an unfavorable impact of $0.04   on adjusted net income per diluted share during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   an unfavorable impact of $0.09   and   $0.31   on adjusted net income per diluted share during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  These translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Executive Summary 
    
  We believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity.  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, available cash reserves, and debt capacity available under various credit facilities.  Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, and shareholder dividends.  We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future. 
    
  Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use.  Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in Fiduciary assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and are not a source of liquidity for us. 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $180 million  , or   14%  , to   $1,475 million   from the prior year period.  This amount represents net income reported by the Company, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of business, financial instruments and foreign exchange, and our non-cash expenses, which include share-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and collection of receivables.   The   increase   from the prior year was primarily driven by increased net income and reductions in pension contributions, as well as working capital improvements.  
    
  Pension contributions were   $91 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $164 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the remainder of   2016  , we expect to contribute approximately   $59 million   to our pension plans, with the majority attributable to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
    
  We expect cash generated by operations for   2016   to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, continue purchases of shares under the Repurchase Programs, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders.  Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows.  We have committed credit facilities totaling   $1.3 billion  , of which all   $1.3 billion   was available at   September 30, 2016  , and can access these facilities on a same day or next day basis.  Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Cash flow   used for   investing activities was   $371 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The primary drivers of the cash flow   used for   investing activities were   $153 million   of capital expenditures,   $198 million   of acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired,   $108 million   in net purchases of short-term investments, and   $16 million   of net purchases of investments, offset by   $104 million   in proceeds from the sale of businesses.  The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by the net sales of long-term investments are recognized in   Other income   in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  

46 

Cash flow   used for   investing activities was   $186 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The primary drivers of the cash flow used for investing activities were   $9 million   in net purchases of short-term investments,   $225 million   of capital expenditures, and   $26 million   of acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, offset by   $54 million   in proceeds from the sale of businesses and   $20 million   of net proceeds from investments.      
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Cash flow   used for   financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1,015 million  . The primary drivers of the cash flow   used for   financing activities were   $1,037 million   of share repurchases,   $258 million   of dividends paid to shareholders,   $70 million   in net cash payments related to issuance of shares, and   $71 million   of transactions with noncontrolling interests and other financing activities, partially offset by   $421 million   of   issuances of debt, net of repayments  .   
    
  Cash flow   used for   financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $930 million  . The primary drivers of cash flow   used for   financing activities were   $1,150 million   of share repurchases,   $240 million   of dividends paid to shareholders,   $148 million   in net cash payments related to issuance of shares, and   $26 million   of transactions with noncontrolling interests and other financing activities, partially offset by   $634 million   of issuances of debt, net of repayments. 
    
  As a U.K. incorporated company, we are required under U.K. law to have available "distributable reserves" to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable reserves are created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings).  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had distributable reserves in excess of   $1.9 billion   and   $2.1 billion  , respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund shareholder dividends, if and to the extent declared, for the foreseeable future. 
    
  Cash and Investments 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were   $946 million  ,   an increase   of   $206 million   from   December 31, 2015  .  This   increase   was primarily related to   $1,475 million   cash provided by operations and   $421 million   in proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments, and   $104 million   in proceeds from the sale of businesses, partially offset by   $1,037 million   in share repurchases,   $153 million   of capital expenditures,   $198 million   in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, and   $258 million   in dividends, and   $108 million   in net sales of short-term investments.  Of the total balance as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $85 million   was restricted as to its use, which was comprised of   $56 million   of operating funds in the U.K., as required by the Financial Conduct Authority, and   $29 million   held as collateral for various business purposes.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.6 billion   of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $622 million   were held in other countries. We maintain multicurrency cash pools with a third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate.  Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero.  At   September 30, 2016  , non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities were negative; however, the overall balance was positive.   
    
  Of the total balance of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments as of   December 31, 2015  ,   $105 million   was restricted as to its use, which was comprised of   $65 million   of operating funds in the U.K., as required by the Financial Conduct Authority, and   $40 million   held as collateral for various business purposes. At   December 31, 2015  ,   $2.6 billion   of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $1.9 billion   were held in other countries. 
    
  In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter.  We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds.  Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity.  In addition, some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf.  The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly, depending on when we collect premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates.  Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions.  In our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amounts we report for Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities are equal.  Our Fiduciary assets included cash and short-term investments of   $3.8 billion   and   $3.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and fiduciary receivables of   $4.9 billion   and   $6.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes. 

47 

As disclosed in Note 13 "Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments" of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds.  The Company's investments in money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value.  Consistent with market convention, we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value.  These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions.  We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our investments in money market funds had a fair value of   $1.5 billion   and are reported as Short-term investments or Fiduciary assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature. 
    
  The following table summarizes our Fiduciary assets, non-fiduciary Cash and cash equivalents, and Short-term investments at   September 30, 2016   (in millions): 

Share Repurchase Program 
    
  In April 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the 2012 Share Repurchase Program under which up to $5.0 billion of Class A Ordinary Shares may be repurchased. In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the 2014 Share Repurchase Program pursuant to which up to $5.0 billion may be repurchased in addition to the $5.0 billion authorized under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program. Under each program, shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, based on prevailing market conditions, funded from available capital. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased 2.7 million shares at an average price per share of $110.26 for a total cost of $301 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $101.16 for a total cost of approximately $1.1 billion.  Included in the 2.7 million shares and 10.4 million shares repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 128 thousand shares that did not settle until October 2016.  These shares were settled at an average price per share of $112.00 and total cost of $14.3 million.  In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Company repurchased   6.3 million   shares at an average price per share of   $95.75   for a total cost of approximately   $600 million  .  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 11.7 million shares at an average price per share of $98.00 for a total cost of approximately $1.15 billion. 
    
  In August 2015, the $5 billion of Class A Ordinary Shares authorized under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program was exhausted. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program is approximately   $3.0 billion  .  Under the Repurchase Programs, the Company has repurchased a total of   88.4 million   shares for an aggregate cost of approximately   $7.0 billion  . 
    
  For information regarding share repurchases made during the   third   quarter of   2016  , see Part II, Item 2 of this report. 
    
  Borrowings 
    
  Total debt at   September 30, 2016   was   $6.2 billion  , which represents   an increase   of   $460 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  . This   increase   is primarily due to the issuance of $750 million of 3.875% Senior Notes due December 2025 and   an increase   in commercial paper outstanding of   $194 million  , partially offset by the repayment of $500 million of 3.125% Senior Notes due May 2016, which matured in May 2016.  Commercial paper activity during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included total issuances of   $0.7 billion   and   $2.0 billion  , respectively, compared to   $1.0 billion   and   $2.9 billion   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.  

48 

On March 1, 2016, Aon plc issued   $750 million   of   3.875%   Senior Notes due December 2025.  We used the proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes. 
    
  On May 27, 2016,   $500 million   of   3.125%   Senior Notes due 2016 issued by Aon Corporation matured and were repaid. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Aon plc had   two   primary committed credit facilities outstanding: its   $400 million   U.S. credit facility expiring in March 2017 (the "2017 Facility") and its   $900 million   multi-currency U.S. credit facility originally expiring in February 2020.  Effective February 2, 2016, the $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility terms were extended for one year and will now expire on February 2, 2021 (the "2021 Facility"). Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs.  In addition, each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had no borrowings under, and were in compliance with, these financial covenants and all other covenants contained in the 2017 Facility and the 2021 Facility during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Aon is currently evaluating its alternatives in connection with its expiring 2017 Facility.  
  Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   based on a rolling twelve months is calculated as follows: 

We use EBITDA, as defined by our financial covenants, as a non-GAAP measure.  This supplemental information related to EBITDA represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. 
    
  Shelf Registration Statement 
    
  On September 3, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors.

  Letters of Credit and Other Guarantees 
    
  We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately   $91 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $58 million   at   December 31, 2015  . These letters of credit cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program.  We also have issued LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.  
    
  We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies.  The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately   $82 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $104 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We have provided commitments to fund certain limited partnerships in which we have an interest in the event that the general partners request funding.  Some of these commitments have specific expiration dates and the maximum potential funding under these commitments was   $10 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $12 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the company   funded     $2 million   million of these commitments. 
    
  Other Liquidity Matters 
    
  We do not have significant exposure related to off-balance sheet arrangements. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" below. 
    
  Financial Condition 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our net assets were   $5.5 billion  , representing total assets minus total liabilities,   a decrease   from   $6.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The   decrease   was due primarily to   $1,051 million   of share repurchases,   $258 million   of dividend payments, and   an increase   of   $370 million   in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related primarily to foreign currency translation adjustment and post-retirement benefit obligations, partially offset by Net income of   $921 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Working capital   increased   by   $455 million   to   $1,105 million   from   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss   increased     $370 million   to   $3,793 million   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $3,423 million   at   December 31, 2015  , which was primarily driven by the following: 

negative   net foreign currency translation adjustments of   $227 million  , which are attributable to the   strengthening   of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, 
                
    an increase   of   $132 million   in net post-retirement benefit obligations, and 
                
    net financial instrument   losses   of   $11 million  .

REVIEW BY SEGMENT 
    
  General 
    
  We serve clients through the following segments: 

Risk Solutions   acts as an advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, via consultation, as well as negotiation and placement of insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. 

HR Solutions   partners with organizations to solve their most complex benefits, talent and related financial challenges, and improve business performance by designing, implementing, communicating and administering a wide range of human capital, retirement, investment management, health care, compensation and talent management strategies. 
       
  Risk Solutions 

The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units, and is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , pricing was modestly negative on average globally, and we still consider this a "soft market."  In a soft market, premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity.  Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds.  
    
  Additionally, continuing into the   third   quarter of   2016  , we faced difficult conditions as a result of continued weakness in the global economy and the repricing of credit risk.  Weak economic conditions in many markets around the globe have reduced our customers' demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products, which have had a negative impact on our operational results. 
    
  Risk Solutions generated approximately   62%   of our consolidated total revenues in the   third   quarter. Revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients.  Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients' policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates. 
    
  We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance coverage.  Specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, health care providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide Affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and businesses; provide products and services via Inpoint; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide risk consulting, actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and consumers; and manage captive insurance companies.

Revenue 
    
  Commissions, fees and other revenue for Risk Solutions were as follows (in millions): 

(1) Includes the U.K., Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. 
    
  Commissions, fees and other revenue for Risk Solutions   increased     $26 million  , or   2%  , in the   third   quarter   2016   compared to the   third   quarter   2015  .  The increase in revenue was driven by   3%   organic growth and a   1%   increase in commissions and fees related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , commissions, fees, and other revenue   increased     $17 million   as compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   due to a   3%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, offset by   3%   organic growth.  
    
  Reconciliation of organic revenue growth to reported commissions, fees and other revenue growth for   2016   versus   2015   is as follows: 

(1) Includes the U.K., Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. 
    
  Retail brokerage   Commissions, fees and other revenue increased   2%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   driven by   4%   organic revenue growth, partially offset by a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , commissions, fees, and other revenue increased $17 million as compared to the prior year period driven primarily by   4%   organic revenue growth, offset by a   3%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and a   1%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures.   
    
  Americas   Commissions, fees and other revenue increased   4%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , reflecting   5%   growth in organic revenue and a   1%   increase in commissions and fees related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. For the first   nine   months of 2016, commissions, fees and other revenue increased   1%  , driven by   4%   growth in organic revenue, partially offset by a   3%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  Organic revenue growth of   5%   and   4%   in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,  
  
   52 

respectively, was driven by strong growth in Affinity, record new business generation in US Retail, and solid growth in Latin America.  
    
  International   Commissions, fees and other revenue decreased   2%   in the   third   quarter   2016  , driven by   2%   organic revenue growth, which was more than offset by a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and a   2%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures.  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , commissions, fees, and other revenue decreased $6 million as compared to the prior year period, reflecting organic growth of   4%  , offset by a   3%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and a   1%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures. Organic revenue growth in both periods was driven by continued growth across Asia and New Zealand, as well as solid growth in continental Europe driven by both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio.  
    
  Reinsurance brokerage   Commissions, fees and other revenue increased $1 million in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the prior year period, driven by   1%   organic revenue growth, offset by a   1%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , commissions, fees, and other revenue was flat as compared to the prior year period, as   1%   organic revenue growth was offset by a   1%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue growth for both the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2016 was driven primarily by net new business generation in treaty placements and growth in facultative placements, partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally.  
    
  Operating Income 
    
  Operating income for the   third   quarter   2016     increased     $6 million  , or   2%  , from the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $330 million   in the first quarter of   2016  , and operating income margin remained flat at   19.2%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   when compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , operating income   increased     $117 million  , or   12%  , to   $1,132 million  .  The increase in both periods was driven primarily by solid organic revenue growth and return on investments in data and analytics across the portfolio.  In addition, a decrease in expense related to certain legacy litigation drove operating income growth for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  HR Solutions

  Revenue 
    
  Commissions, fees and other revenue for HR Solutions were as follows (in millions): 

Commissions, fees and other revenue for HR Solutions   decreased     $23 million  , or   2%  , in the   third   quarter   2016   compared to the   third   quarter   2015  .  The modest   decrease   in revenue reflects a   4%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures and a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, partially offset by   4%   organic growth in commissions and fees. For the first   nine   months of   2016  , revenue   decreased     $111 million   due to a   5%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures and a   2%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by   3%   organic growth.

Consulting services   revenue   decreased     $1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the prior year period due primarily to a   3%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, offset by   3%   organic revenue growth.  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , revenue   decreased     $6 million   as compared to the prior year period, as a result of a   3%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates, offset by   2%   organic growth and a   1%   increase in commissions and fees related to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Organic revenue growth for both periods was driven primarily by growth in investment consulting and communications consulting, as well as growth in pension solutions. 
    
  Outsourcing   revenue   decreased     $23 million  , or   4%  , for the   third   quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year period due to an   8%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures and a   1%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by   5%   organic revenue growth.  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , revenue   decreased     $116 million  , or   6%  ,  as a result of a   7%   decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures, and a   1%   unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by   2%   organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth in both periods was driven primarily by continued growth in HR BPO for cloud-based solutions, as well as growth in healthcare exchanges in the   third   quarter, partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration.

Operating Income 
    
  Operating income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $134 million  , comparable to the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the first   nine   months of   2016  , operating income was   $276 million  ,   an increase   from   $249 million   in the prior year period.  The result in the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily driven by organic revenue growth, offset by $7 million of certain legacy information technology contract costs and an unfavorable impact from portfolio repositioning activities in previous quarters.  The   increase   for the first   nine   months was primarily driven by organic revenue growth and a decrease in expenses related to certain legacy litigation settlements in the prior year quarter.  
    
  Operating margin for the HR Solutions segment was   12.9%   in the   third   quarter,   an increase   from   12.6%   in   2015  . For the first   nine   months of   2016  , operating margin was   9.5%  ,   an increase   from   8.3%   in   2015  . 
    
  Unallocated Income and Expense 
    
  A reconciliation of our operating income to income before income taxes is as follows (in millions): 

Unallocated operating expense 
    
  Unallocated operating expense includes corporate governance costs not allocated to our reportable segments.  Net unallocated expenses   decreased     $3 million   to   $42 million   in the   third   quarter   2016   as compared to the prior year period. Net unallocated expenses were   $131 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   $133 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  .

INFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This report and reports we will subsequently file or furnish and have previously filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events.  They use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "project," "intend," "plan," "probably," "potential," "looking forward," and other similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like "could," "may," "might," "should," "will" and "would."  You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  For example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as:  market and industry conditions, including competitive and pricing trends; changes in our business strategies and methods of generating revenue; the development and performance of our services and products; changes in the composition or level of our revenues; our cost structure and the outcome of cost-saving or restructuring initiatives; the outcome of contingencies; dividend policy; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions; pension obligations; cash flow and liquidity; expected effective tax rate; future actions by regulators; and the impact of changes in accounting rules.

    limits on our subsidiaries to make dividend and other payments to us;  
                
    the impact of lawsuits and other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies arising from errors and omissions and other claims against us;  
                
    the impact of, and potential challenges in complying with, legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly given the global scope of our businesses and the possibility of conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions in which we do business;  
                
    the impact of any investigations brought by regulatory authorities in the U.S., U.K. and other countries;  
                
    the impact of any inquiries relating to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and with U.S. and non-U.S. trade sanctions regimes;  
                
    failure to protect intellectual property rights or allegations that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others;  
                
    the effects of English law on our operating flexibility and the enforcement of judgments against us;  
                
    the failure to retain and attract qualified personnel;  
                
    international risks associated with our global operations;  
                
    the effect of natural or man-made disasters;  
                
    the potential of a system or network breach or disruption resulting in operational interruption or improper disclosure of personal data;

   56 

damage to our reputation among clients, markets or third parties;  
                
    the actions taken by third parties that perform aspects of our business operations and client services;   
                
    the extent to which we manage certain risks created in connection with the various services, including fiduciary and investments and other advisory services and business process outsourcing services, among others, that we currently provide, or will provide in the future, to clients;  
                
    our ability to grow, develop and integrate companies that it acquires or new lines of business;  
                
    changes in commercial property and casualty markets, commercial premium rates or methods of compensation;  
                
    changes in the health care system or our relationships with insurance carriers; and 
                
    our ability to implement initiatives intended to yield cost savings and the ability to achieve those cost savings. 
     Any or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about our performance.  The factors identified above are not exhaustive.  Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently.  Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made.  We are under no obligation (and expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or alter any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Further information about factors that could materially affect Aon, including our results of operations and financial condition, is contained in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, "Item 1A Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. 

ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  We are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.  To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments.  We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives as discussed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
    
  We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar, and the Indian Rupee.  We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements. 
    
  Additionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies.  Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. Dollars and Euros, but most of their expenses are incurred in British Pounds.  At   September 30, 2016  , we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries' expected exposures to both U.S. Dollar and Euro transactions for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively.  We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years. 
    
  We also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as inter-company notes and short-term assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement. 
    
  The translated value of revenue and expense from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If the Company were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates, diluted earnings per share would be   a favorable impact of approximately $0.02   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and would be   an unfavorable impact of $0.03   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Further, adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure as defined and reconciled under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results   Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share" would be   a favorable impact of $0.01   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and would be   an unfavorable impact of $0.04   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   if the Company were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates.

Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates.  We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments.  This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and in continental Europe. A decrease in global short-term interest rates adversely affects our fiduciary investment income. 

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.    We have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to Aon, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in appropriate statute, SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to Aon's management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting.    No changes in Aon's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, Aon's internal control over financial reporting.

  (b)        An amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (i) the Executive s annual base salary (as in effect immediately prior to the Termination Date, or immediately prior to any reduction if such CIC Qualifying Termination is a result of a reduction in base salary) and (ii) the Executive s average annual cash incentive bonus over the two fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs, payable in a cash lump sum on the fifty-third (53   rd   ) following the Termination Date (provided however, that (x) if the Executive was not employed by the Company during each of the two fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs, the amount shall be determined based on the average annual cash incentive bonus received by the Executive over the fiscal years in which the Executive was actually employed; and (y) if the Executive has not received an annual cash incentive bonus at any time prior to the Termination Date due to having been a new hire, the amount shall be determined by reference to the Executive s target annual cash incentive opportunity);

   6 

to participate in and receive medical, dental and life insurance benefits under a plan or arrangement sponsored by another employer having benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits provided pursuant to this subsection, the Company shall continue the Executive s medical, dental and life insurance coverage, under the Company-sponsored plans or otherwise, upon the same terms and otherwise to the same extent as such coverage shall have been in effect immediately prior to the Executive s Termination Date, and the Company and the Executive shall share the costs of the continuation of such medical, dental and life insurance coverage in the same proportion as such costs were shared immediately prior to the Termination Date; provided that the Company s share of the cost of the continuation of coverage under any self-insured medical reimbursement plan that is subject to Section 105(h) of the Code shall be included in the Executive s taxable income from the Company.  Such continuation of coverage shall be in satisfaction of the Company s obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, to the extent applicable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide the foregoing continuation of benefits without potentially violating applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 2716 of the U.S. Public Health Service Act), the Company shall, in lieu of such benefits, provide Executive with a taxable cash payment equal to one-hundred percent  (100%) of the portion of the applicable monthly premium the Company would pay for such coverage as in effect at such time, for each calendar month (including partial months) remaining until the earlier of (i) second anniversary of the Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the Executive becomes eligible to participate in and receive such benefits under a plan or arrangement sponsored by another employer. 
  6.        Release of Claims  .

For the avoidance of doubt, the Severance Benefits shall be provided as compensation for services rendered to the Company and in consideration of the covenants set forth in the Release.  The Executive shall forfeit the Severance Benefits in the event that the Executive fails to execute and deliver the Release to the Company in accordance with the timing and other provisions of this Section or revokes such Release prior to the date it becomes effective.   
  7.        Reduction of Payments  .  Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, but determined without regard to any adjustment required under this Section) (in the aggregate, the  Total Payments ) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter referred to as the  Excise Tax ), and if it is determined that (a) the amount remaining, after the Total Payments are reduced by an amount equal to all applicable federal and state taxes (computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), including the Excise Tax, is less than (b) the amount remaining, after taking into account all applicable federal and state taxes (computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), after payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the Executive of the maximum amount that may be paid or distributed to or for the benefit of the Executive without resulting in the imposition of the Excise Tax, then the payments due hereunder shall be reduced so that the Total Payments are One Dollar ($1) less than such maximum amount.  All determinations to be made pursuant to this Section 7 shall be made by the public accounting firm that serves as the Company s auditor. 
  8.        Section 409A  .   
  
   7 

(a)        A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Plan providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that are subject to the requirements of Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment, unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a  termination,   termination of employment,  or like terms shall mean  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A. 
  (b)        Each payment to be made to an Executive under this Plan shall be treated as a  separate payment  for purposes of Section 409A. 
  (c)        In the event that any payment or distribution or portion of any payment or distribution to be made to the Executive hereunder cannot be characterized as a  short term deferral  for purposes of Section 409A or is not otherwise exempt from the provisions of Section 409A, and the Executive is determined to be a  specified employee  under Section 409A, such portion of the payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six (6) months and one day following the Executive's  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A (the  Delay Period ). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, the payments delayed pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the Executive or his or her beneficiary in a lump sum, and any remaining payments due under this Plan shall be payable in accordance with their original payment schedule. 
  (d)        To the extent that the reimbursement of any expenses or the provision of any in-kind benefits under this Plan is subject to Section 409A, (i) the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any one calendar year shall not affect the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (ii) reimbursement of any such expense shall be made by no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which such expense is incurred; and (iii) the Executive s right to receive such reimbursements of in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
  (e)        The time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Plan may not be accelerated except as otherwise permitted under Section 409A. 
  (f)        The parties intend that this Plan and the benefits provided hereunder be interpreted and construed to comply with Section 409A to the extent applicable thereto, including the exceptions for short-term deferrals, separation pay arrangements, reimbursements, and in-kind distributions. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Plan shall be interpreted and construed consistent with this intent, provided that the Company shall not be required to assume any increased economic burden in connection therewith. To the extent that any provision of this Plan would fail to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make such modifications to the Plan and/or payments to be made thereunder to the extent it determines necessary or advisable to comply with the requirements of Section 409A; provided, however, that the Company shall in no event be obligated to pay any interest, compensation, or penalties in respect of any such modifications. Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that it will comply with the requirements of Section 409A, the Company does not represent or warrant that the Plan will comply with Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States law. Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries, nor their respective directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be liable to the Executive (or any other individual claiming a benefit through the Executive) for any tax, interest, or penalties the Executive may owe as a result of compensation paid under the Plan, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to indemnify or otherwise protect the Executive from the obligation to pay any taxes pursuant to Section 409A.

  (c)        The Plan Administrator may from time to time delegate any of his or her duties hereunder to such person or persons as the Plan Administrator may designate.  The Plan Administrator is empowered, on behalf of this Plan, to engage accountants, legal counsel and such other persons as the Plan Administrator deems necessary or advisable for the performance of his or her duties under this Plan.

All reasonable fees and expenses of such persons shall be borne by the Company. 
  10.        Withholding Taxes  .  The Company may withhold from all payments due under this Plan to each Executive (or the Executive s beneficiary or estate) all taxes which, by applicable federal, state, local or other law, the Company is required to withhold therefrom.

  12.        Offset; Mitigation  .   
  (a)        For non-U.S. Executives who are not subject to U.S. federal income tax:  If the Company is obligated by law to pay severance pay, notice pay or other similar benefits, or if the Company is obligated by law to provide advance notice of separation ( Notice Period ), then any payments hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of any such severance pay, notice pay or other similar benefits, as applicable, and by the amount of any severance pay, notice pay or other similar benefits received during any Notice Period.   
  (b)        In no event shall an Executive be obligated to seek other employment or to take other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable and the benefits provided to such Executive under any of the provisions of this Plan, and such amounts and benefits shall not be reduced whether or not such Executive obtains other employment, except as otherwise provided in Section 5(d) hereof. 
  13.        Unfunded Plan  .  This Plan shall not be funded.  No Executive entitled to benefits hereunder shall have any right to, or interest in, any specific assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, but an Executive shall have only the rights of a general creditor of the Company to receive benefits on the terms and subject to the conditions provided in this Plan. 
  14.        Payments to Minors, Incompetents and Beneficiaries  .  Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of giving a receipt therefor shall be deemed paid when paid to such person s guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person, and such payment shall fully discharge the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Plan Administrator and all other parties with respect thereto.  If an Executive shall die while any amounts would be payable to the Executive under this Plan had the Executive continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to such person or persons appointed in writing by the Executive to receive such amounts or, if no person is so appointed, to the estate of the Executive. 
  15.        Non-Assignability  .  None of the payments, benefits or rights of any Executive shall be subject to any claim of any creditor, and, in particular, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all such payments, benefits and rights shall be free from attachment, garnishment, trustee s process or any other legal or equitable process available to any creditor of such Executive.  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, no right or interest of any Executive under this Plan shall be assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation by execution, levy, garnishment, attachment or pledge; no attempted assignment or transfer thereof shall be effective; and no right or interest of any Executive under this Plan shall be subject to any obligation or liability of such Executive. 
  
   10 

16.        No Rights to Continued Employment  .  Neither the adoption of this Plan, nor any amendment hereof, nor the creation of any fund, trust or account, nor the payment of any benefits, shall be construed as giving any Executive the right to be retained in the service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and all Executives shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if this Plan had not been adopted. 
  17.        Successors; Binding Agreement  .  This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the parties, including each Executive, present and future, and any successor to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries.

  Aon plc 
  PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL 
    
  [            ] 
  [Date] 
  Dear [            ]: 
  Service as a Non-Executive Director 
  On behalf of Aon plc (the "Company"), I am writing to confirm your service as a Non-Executive Director of the Company (the "Appointment") with effect from the date hereof. The terms of the Appointment are set out below.

           1. 
    The Appointment will be subject to the Company s Articles of Association (a copy of which will be made available to you on request). 
              2. 
    The Appointment may be terminated at any time by the Company in accordance with the Company s Articles of Association or the Companies Act 2006, or upon your resignation. 
              3. 
    If you desire to continue serving as a Non-Executive Director, the Company s Articles of Association require that you stand for re-election at the Company s next AGM. 
              4. 
    By accepting the Appointment, you confirm that you are able to allocate sufficient time to perform your role. Personal attendance will be required at Board Meetings and Board Committee meetings unless agreed otherwise in advance with the Chairman. 
              5. 
    As a Non-Executive Director you have the same general legal responsibilities to the Company as any other Director. 
              6. 
    The Board as a whole is collectively responsible for promoting the success of the Company by directing and supervising the Company s affairs. At all times you must carry out your duties diligently, with due skill, care and attention and use your best endeavors to promote and protect the interests of the Company. 

7. 
    You shall exercise your powers in your role as a non-executive director having regard to all relevant obligations under prevailing law and regulation, including the Companies Act 2006. 
     Fees 
           8. 
    You will be paid a cash fee as set by the Board from time to time. You will also be paid additional cash fees in respect of your membership on any Board committee in the amount determined by the Board from time to time. The fee will be paid quarterly in arrears, net of statutory deductions 
              9. 
    In addition, if you are elected to continue serving as a Non-Executive Director, you will receive a grant of Class A Ordinary Shares in an amount set forth by the Board from time to time. 
              10. 
    You will be entitled to participate in such share based plans, charitable contribution arrangements, deferred compensation plans, deferred benefit retirement plans, bequest plans or other compensation arrangements as the Board shall operate for the benefit of Non Executive Directors from time to time. 
              11.

     Other Directorships and Business Interests 

14. 
    All directors must take decisions objectively in the best interests of the Company. You will be expected to bring an independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct.

              15. 
    The Company acknowledges that you have business interests other than those of the Company and that you have declared any conflicts that are apparent at present.

In these circumstances, the Company will refund to you the cost of these professional fees, in accordance with the Board s procedure on these matters. 
     Moral Rights

              27.

              28. 
    The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 shall not apply to this letter. No person other than you and the Company shall have any rights under this letter and the terms of this letter shall not be enforceable by any person other than you and the Company.

              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
