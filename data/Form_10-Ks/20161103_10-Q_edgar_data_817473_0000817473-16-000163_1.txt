  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 
  (in millions, except per share data) 

Note 1.        Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements    
  Interim consolidated financial statements of American Capital, Ltd. (which is referred to throughout this report as  American Capital ,  we ,  us  and  our ) are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim periods have been included. The current period s consolidated results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the year. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 
  Reclassifications 
  We have reclassified certain prior period amounts in our consolidated financial statements to conform to our current period presentation.  
  Upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ) effective January 1, 2016, debt issuance costs associated with our borrowings, other than our revolving credit facilities, were reclassified as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related borrowing. In accordance with ASU No. 2015-15,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  , debt issuance costs associated with our revolving credit facilities remain classified as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the facility. Pursuant to ASU 2015-03, we have reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our borrowings, excluding our revolving facilities, in our previously reported consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 as follows: 

Reclassifications had no impact on prior periods  net earnings or shareholders  equity. 
  Consolidation 
  Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, the SEC s Division of Investment Management s consolidation guidance in IM Guidance Update No. 2014-11 issued in October 2014 and Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946,   Financial Services-Investment Companies   ( ASC 946 ), we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company that acts as an extension of our investment operations and facilitates the execution of our investment strategy. An exception to this guidance occurs if we have an investment in a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to us.  
  We currently consolidate ACAS Funding I, LLC and ACAS Funding II, LLC, which are wholly-owned special purpose financing vehicles that were formed for the purpose of purchasing Senior Floating Rate Loans under a $1.25 billion secured revolving credit facility and $500 million secured revolving credit facility, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , ACAS Funding I, LLC and ACAS Funding II, LLC did not have any other operations or activities. As of   December 31, 2015  , we also consolidated American Capital TRS, LLC ( ACTRS ), which is a wholly-owned entity that has entered into non-recourse total return swaps ( TRS ) with Citibank, N.A. As of   December 31, 2015  , ACTRS did not have any other operations or activities. The TRS is accounted for as a derivative pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  . 
  Our consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of European Capital Limited ( European Capital ), which is a wholly-owned investment company that, effective October 1, 2014, acts as an extension of our investment operations and facilitates the execution of our investment strategy. In addition, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AC

Corporate Holdings, Inc. ( ACCH ) and ACE Acquisition Holdings, LLC ( ACE Acquisition ), which are wholly-owned entities that have purchased certain investment securities on behalf of American Capital. As of   September 30, 2016  , European Capital, ACCH and ACE Acquisition did not have any other operations or activities and were considered to be investment companies under ASC 946, as amended by ASU No. 2013-08,   Financial Services-Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements  .    
   
  Note 2.        Organization    
  We are a non-diversified closed end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ( 1940 Act ). As a BDC, we have invested primarily in senior and mezzanine debt and equity in buyouts of private companies sponsored by us ( American Capital One Stop Buyouts        ) or sponsored by other private equity funds and have provided capital directly to early stage and mature private and small public companies ( Sponsor Finance and Other Investments ). We also have invested in structured finance investments ( Structured Products ), including collateralized loan obligation ( CLO ) securities. Our primary business objectives have been to increase our net earnings and net asset value ( NAV ) by making investments with attractive current yields and/or potential for equity appreciation and realized gains.  
  Through our tax years ended September 30, 1998 through September 30, 2010, we qualified to be taxed as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Effective with our tax year ended September 30, 2011, we did not qualify to be taxed as a RIC and became subject to taxation as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code (a  Subchapter C corporation ). This change in tax status does not affect our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act or our compliance with the portfolio composition requirements of that statute. 
   
  Note 3.        New Accounting Pronouncements    
       
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which amends and conforms the guidance on the recognition of assets and liabilities that arise from operating and finance leases. Under ASU 2016-02, all leases create an asset and a liability for the lessee that should be recognized in the statement of financial position as a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability), initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. ASU 2016-02 also provides clarifying guidance on optional lease payments and variable lease payments as well as the income statement and cash flow presentation of operating and finance leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2016-06 ), which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts and requires that an entity assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence in ASC 815. ASU 2016-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payments and affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. ASU 2016-09 primarily simplifies the accounting for and classification of, income taxes related to share-based payment awards, including the impact of income taxes withheld on the classification of awards as equity or liabilities and the classification of income taxes on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 also permits an entity to elect a forfeiture rate assumption based on the estimated number of awards expected to vest or to account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2016. The provisions of ASU 2019-06 should be adopted on a modified retrospective, retrospective or prospective basis, depending on the provision. As a result of the early adoption on January 1, 2016, we recognized a deferred tax asset associated with excess tax benefits and a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to our shareholders  equity of $16 million on our consolidated balance sheets.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40,   Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets,   related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public business entities that meet the U.S. GAAP definition of an SEC filer, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on the recognition of interest income on our investments in Structured Products. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under ASC 230,   Statement of Cash Flows  , and other topics. ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues including the statement of cash flows treatment of beneficial interests in securitized financial transactions as well as the treatment of debt prepayment and extinguishment costs. ASU 2016-15 also provides guidance on the predominance principle to clarify when cash receipts and cash payments should be separated into more than one class of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
   
  Note 4.        Investments    
    
  Our investments consist of loans and securities issued by public and privately-held companies, including senior debt, mezzanine debt, equity warrants and preferred and common equity securities. We also invest in Structured Products, which includes CLO securities. 
  We fair value our investments in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ) as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. We undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter to determine the fair value of our investments in accordance with ASC 820. The quarterly valuation process begins with the development of a preliminary valuation recommendation for each investment by our Financial Advisory and Consulting Team ( FACT ), which is composed of valuation and audit professionals responsible for monitoring portfolio compliance and valuations. In preparing the preliminary valuation recommendations, FACT receives assistance from our investment professionals that both originated and monitor the investment as well as assistance from other departments including operations, accounting and legal. The preliminary valuation recommendations are reviewed by senior management and then presented to our Audit, Compliance and Valuation Committee for review and approval. Subsequent to the approval from our Audit, Compliance and Valuation Committee, the valuation recommendations are sent to our Board of Directors for final approval. 
  When available, we base the fair value of our investments that trade in active markets on directly observable market prices or on market data derived for comparable assets. For restricted securities of companies that are publicly traded, the value is based on the closing market quote on the valuation date less a discount for the restriction. For all other investments, inputs used to measure fair value reflect management s best estimate of assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a hypothetical transaction. For these investments, we estimate the fair value of our senior debt, mezzanine debt, redeemable and convertible preferred equity, common equity and equity warrants using either an enterprise value waterfall methodology, which generally combines market and income approaches, or a market yield valuation methodology, which utilizes the income approach. We estimate the fair value of our Structured Products using the market and income approaches, third-party broker quotes and counterparty marks. 
  ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for our investments existed, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned.

ASC 820 defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The price used to measure the fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs while the cost basis of our investments may include initial transaction costs. Under ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset. The principal market for an asset is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset under ASC 820, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to the market as of the measurement date. If no market for the asset exists or if the reporting entity does not have access to the principal market, the reporting entity should use a hypothetical market.  
     The principal market in which we would sell our Senior Floating Rate Loans and certain of our non-controlled Sponsor Finance debt investments is an active over-the-counter secondary market. For our other debt and equity investments, there is no active market and we are generally repaid our debt investment or sell our equity investment upon a change of control transaction such as through the mergers and acquisitions ( M A ) market. Accordingly, the market in which we would sell certain of our non-controlled debt and all of our equity investments is the M A market. However, under ASC 820, we have identified the M A market as the principal market for our investments in these portfolio companies only if we have the ability to control the decision to sell the portfolio company as of the measurement date. We determine whether we have the ability to control the decision to sell a portfolio company based on our ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company as of the measurement date and rights within the shareholders agreement. In evaluating if we can control or gain control of a portfolio company as of the measurement date, we include our equity securities and those securities held by entities managed by our wholly-owned portfolio company, American Capital Asset Management, LLC ( ACAM ), on a fully diluted basis. For investments in portfolio companies for which we do not have the ability to control or gain control as of the measurement date and for which there is no active market, the principal market under ASC 820 is a hypothetical secondary market.  
     Accordingly, we use the M A market as the principal market for our investments in portfolio companies that we control or can gain control as of the measurement date, and we use a hypothetical secondary market for our investments in portfolio companies that we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date. However, to the extent that an active market exists for such investments, we will consider that as the principal market. Our valuation policy considers the fact that no ready active market exists for a significant amount of our investments and that the fair value for our investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs.  
     Enterprise Value Waterfall Methodology    
  For investments in portfolio companies that we have identified the M A market as the principal market, we estimate the fair value based on the enterprise value waterfall ( Enterprise Value Waterfall ) valuation methodology. For minority equity securities in which the principal market is the hypothetical secondary market, we also estimate the fair value using the Enterprise Value Waterfall valuation methodology.     
  Under the Enterprise Value Waterfall valuation methodology, we estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company and then waterfall the enterprise value over the portfolio company s securities in order of their preference relative to one another. In applying the Enterprise Value Waterfall valuation methodology, we consider that in a change of control transaction, our loans are generally required to be repaid at par and that a buyer cannot assume the loan. 
  To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, we prepare an analysis of traditional valuation methodologies including valuations of comparable public companies, recent sales of private and public comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, estimating the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company s assets, third-party valuations of the portfolio company, offers from third-parties to buy the portfolio company and considering the value of recent third-party investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company. Significant inputs in these valuation methodologies to estimate enterprise value include the historical or projected operating results of the portfolio company, selection of comparable companies, discounts or premiums to the prices of comparable companies and discount rates applied to the forecasted cash flows. The operating results of a portfolio company may be unaudited, projected or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for non-recurring items or to normalize the operating results that may require significant judgment in its determination. In addition, projecting future financial results requires significant judgment regarding future growth assumptions. In evaluating the operating results, we also analyze the impact of exposure to litigation, loss of customers or other contingencies. The selection of a population of comparable companies requires significant judgment, including a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the comparability of the companies. In determining a discount or premium, if any, to prices of comparable companies, we use significant judgment for factors such as size, marketability, relative performance, and for portfolio companies in which we

control, a control premium to the market price of comparable public companies. In determining a discount rate to apply to forecasted cash flows, we use significant judgment in the development of an appropriate discount rate including the evaluation of an appropriate risk premium.  
  In valuing convertible debt, equity or other similar securities, we value our investment based on its priority in the waterfall and based on our pro rata share of the residual equity value available after deducting all outstanding debt from the estimated enterprise value. We value non-convertible debt at the face amount of the debt to the extent that the estimated enterprise value of the portfolio company exceeds the outstanding debt of the portfolio company. If the estimated enterprise value is less than the outstanding debt of the portfolio company, we reduce the fair value of our debt investment beginning with the junior most debt such that the enterprise value less the fair value of the outstanding debt is zero.  
  Market Yield Valuation Methodology    
  For debt and redeemable preferred equity investments in portfolio companies for which we are required to identify a hypothetical secondary market as the principal market, we estimate the fair value based on the assumptions that we believe hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using a market yield ( Market Yield ) valuation methodology.    
  For debt and redeemable preferred equity investments of our investment portfolio for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date and no active market exists, we estimate the fair value based on such factors as third-party broker quotes and our own assumptions in the absence of market observable data, including estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar loans and securities as of the measurement date. We weight the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer. We estimate the remaining life based on market data of the average life of similar loans. However, if we have information available to us that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term, we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date, including considering the current maturity date of the loan. The average life used to estimate the fair value of our loans may be shorter than the legal maturity of the loans since our loans have historically been prepaid prior to the maturity date. The current interest rate spreads used to estimate the fair value of our loans is based on the current interest rate spreads on similar loans. We use significant judgment in determining the estimated remaining life as well as the current market yield and interest rate spreads. If there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a loan, we may consider other factors that a hypothetical market participant would use to estimate fair value, including the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis.     
  We fair value our investments in Structured Products based on such factors as third-party broker quotes, counterparty marks, purchases or sales of the same or similar securities, and our cash flow forecasts. Cash flow forecasts are subject to assumptions a market participant would use regarding the investments  underlying collateral including, but not limited to, assumptions of default and recovery rates, reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates. Cash flow forecasts are discounted using a market participant s market yield assumptions that are derived from multiple sources including, but not limited to, third-party broker quotes, industry research reports and transactions of securities and indices with similar structure and risk characteristics. We weight the use of third-party broker quotes or counterparty marks, if any, in determining fair value based on the correlation of changes in third-party broker quotes with underlying performance and other market indices. 
     Third-party Vendor Pricing  
  For debt investments that trade in an active market or that have similar assets that trade in an active market, we estimate the fair value based on evaluated prices from a nationally recognized, independent pricing service or from third-party brokers who make markets in such debt instruments. When possible, we make inquiries of third-party pricing sources to understand their use of significant inputs and assumptions. We review the price provided by the third-party pricing service and perform procedures to validate their reasonableness, including a review and analysis of executable broker quote(s), range and dispersion of third-party estimates, frequency of pricing updates, yields of similar securities or other qualitative and quantitative information. If the prices provided by the pricing service are consistent with such information, we will generally use the price provided by the pricing service as fair value.

Investments in Investment Funds  
  For an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, we measure the fair value of our investment predominately based on the NAV per share of the investment fund if the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC 946 as of the measurement date, including measurement of all or substantially all of the underlying investments of the investee in accordance with ASC 820. However, in determining the fair value of our investment, we may make adjustments to the NAV per share in certain circumstances, based on our analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our shares of our investment as of the measurement date, any restrictions on the ability to receive dividends, comparisons of market price to NAV per share of comparable publicly traded funds and trades or sales of comparable private and publicly traded funds, recent actual sales or redemptions of shares of the investment fund, public to private liquidity discounts, expected future cash flows available to equity holders including the rate of return on those cash flows compared to an implied market return on equity required by market participants, or other uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize the full NAV of the investment fund. 
  Partnership Interests 
  For an investment in a partnership, we measure the fair value of our investment based on the NAV per share of the partnership or its equivalent as a practical expedient to measure an alternative investment at fair value consistent with the measurement principles of ASC 820, as amended by ASU No. 2009-12,   Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)  . We make this election on an investment-by-investment basis and apply consistently to our entire position in the investment, unless it is probable at the measurement date that we will sell all or a portion of our investment at an amount other than NAV per share. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes to our valuation techniques or to the types of unobservable inputs used in the valuation process compared to the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The levels of fair value inputs used to measure our investments are characterized in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820. Where inputs for an asset or liability fall in more than one level in the fair value hierarchy, the investment is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to that investment s fair value measurement. We use judgment and consider factors specific to the investment in determining the significance of an input to a fair value measurement. Our policy is to recognize transfers in and out of levels as of the beginning of each reporting period. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy and investments that fall into each of the levels are described below: 
             
    Level 1:   Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.  
                
    Level 2:   Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  
                
    Level 3:   Level 3 inputs are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data.

Note 5.        Borrowings    
  Our borrowings, net of deferred financing costs, consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2016, debt issuance costs associated with our borrowings, other than our revolving credit facilities, were reclassified as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related borrowing. 
  The daily weighted average debt balance, excluding deferred financing costs and discounts, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was $288 million and $720 million, respectively, compared to $2,315 million and $2,124 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in   2015  .   The weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings, including amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs and discounts, for the     three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     was     6.9% and 6.5%, respectively, compared to 3.7% and 3.6%, respectively, for the comparable periods in     2015  .

rate on all of our borrowings, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts, for the     three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     was     6.5% and 4.9%, respectively, compared to 3.1% and 3.1%, respectively, for the comparable periods in     2015  . The weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings, excluding deferred financing costs and discounts, as of   December 31, 2015   was 4.0%. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate fair value of our borrowings, excluding deferred financing costs and discounts, was $1,273 million. The fair values of our borrowings are determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, and are measured using Level 3 inputs for our debt as of   December 31, 2015  . It assumes that the liability is transferred to a market participant at the measurement date and that the nonperformance risk relating to that liability is the same before and after the transfer. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which the liability is transferred. The fair value of our borrowings is valued at the closing market quotes as of the measurement date or estimated based upon market interest rates for our own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any, based on a quantitative and/or qualitative evaluation of our credit risk. 
  Unsecured Private Notes  
  On September 20, 2013, we entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee ( Trustee ), relating to the issuance and sale by us of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured five-year notes ( Private Notes ), for proceeds of $342 million, net of underwriters  discounts. The Private Notes were sold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Private Notes had a fixed interest rate of 6.50% and were scheduled to mature in September 2018. 
  On July 1, 2016, we provided notice to the Trustee   of our election to redeem all of the   Private Notes. The Private Notes were redeemed on September 15, 2016 (the  Redemption Date ) at a redemption price (the  Redemption Price ) of 101.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Private Notes to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. We recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $9 million as a result of writing off the deferred debt issuance costs and discount in conjunction with repaying the outstanding amounts under the Private Notes at the Redemption Price. 
  Secured Term Loan Facility  
  On February 26, 2014, we entered into an amendment (the  Amendment ) to the amended secured term loan facility under our Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of August 23, 2013, with the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the  Secured Term Loan Facility ).  
  The Amendment reduced the interest rate on the Secured Term Loan Facility, which had an outstanding principal balance of $450 million as of the closing date, from LIBOR plus 3.00%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, to LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. The Amendment also extended the Secured Term Loan Facility s maturity date by one year to August 2017. 
  In accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic No. 470-50,   Modifications and Extinguishments  , $447 million of debt exchanged with the same lenders met the criterion for and was accounted as a modification of debt. Existing unamortized deferred financing costs and discount attributable to the modification of the Secured Term Loan Facility of $9 million will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the Secured Term Loan Facility using the effective interest method, while fees paid to other third-party advisors of $1 million were expensed. 
  On July 1, 2016, we terminated the Secured Term Loan Facility. The outstanding balance under the Secured Term Loan Facility was repaid in full in connection with the termination. We did not incur any early termination fees or penalties as a result of the termination of the Secured Term Loan Facility. We recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $3 million as a result of writing off the deferred debt issuance costs and discount.  
  $250 Million Revolving Credit Facility 
  On August 22, 2012, we obtained a four-year $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the  $250 Million Revolving Credit Facility ), which bore interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.75%.  
  On August 22, 2015, the commitments under the $250 Million Revolving Credit Facility terminated. As a result, the outstanding balance under the $250 Million Revolving Credit Facility was repayable ratably over the final 12 months until the maturity date on August 22, 2016. On June 22, 2016, the $250 Million Revolving Credit Facility was repaid in full and terminated.

$1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility 
  On June 27, 2014, ACAS Funding I, LLC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, obtained a $750 million secured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. On March 6, 2015, the commitments under the existing $750 million secured revolving credit facility were increased by $500 million to $1.25 billion (the  $1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility ). In addition to the commitment increase, the maturity date of the facility was extended to March 6, 2017. On June 9, 2016, the $1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility was terminated. We recorded interest expense of $4 million as a result of writing off the deferred debt issuance costs. 
  $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility 
  On October 30, 2014, ACAS Funding II, LLC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, obtained a $500 million secured revolving credit facility (the  $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility ), with Deutsche Bank AG. The $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility was scheduled to mature in October 2016 and had an interest rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 1.60%. On January 6, 2016, the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility was repaid in full and terminated. We recorded interest expense of $1 million as a result of writing off the deferred debt issuance costs. 
   
  Note 6.        Stock Options    
  We have stock option plans which provide for the granting of options to employees and non-employee directors to purchase shares of common stock at a price of not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted under the employee stock option plans vest over either a three or five year period and may be exercised for a period of no more than ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under these plans may be either incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code or non-qualified stock options. As required by the 1940 Act, we are restricted from issuing awards to our employees and non-employee directors to the extent that the amount of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all such awards at the time of issuance exceeds 20% of our outstanding voting securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were 3.6 million shares available to be granted under the employee stock option plans and in accordance with the 1940 Act restrictions.  
  Our shareholders approved non-employee director stock option plans in 1998, 2000, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and we subsequently received orders from the SEC authorizing such plans. Stock options granted under the non-employee director stock option plans are non-qualified stock options that vest over a three year period and may be exercised for a period of no more than ten years from the date of grant. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no shares available to be granted under the non-employee director stock option plans. No employee or non-employee director stock options were granted during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  During the first quarter of 2014, we concluded that our Chief Executive Officer had been granted stock options in excess of the individual employee limits established in certain of our stock option plans. These stock option grants were made during fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result, the stock option grants in excess of the individual limits in any stock option plan have been considered null and void. The communication of the voided stock option grants to our Chief Executive Officer resulted in a financial obligation under U.S. GAAP to provide equity compensation commensurate with the terms of the voided stock option grants in return for services to be performed by our Chief Executive Officer during the option vesting periods. During the second quarter of 2014, pursuant to the Deferred Plan, an award of $10 million was granted to our Chief Executive Officer that partially settled this financial obligation. During the first quarter of 2015, an award of $7 million was granted to our Chief Executive Officer that settled the remainder of this financial obligation. These grants were funded with shares of common stock from the Trust that had previously been forfeited by former employees prior to being fully vested in their shares. 
  Due to changes in the composition of our investment portfolio and market conditions, we conducted strategic reviews of our business which resulted in workforce reductions of our employees. In conjunction with the restructuring, the vesting of any unvested stock options held by impacted employees as of the date of their separation was accelerated, and the employees were given a period of up to one year from their separation date, or less if the expiration of the option was within one year from their separation date, to exercise all outstanding options. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,   Compensation-Stock Compensation  , the acceleration of 0.8 million and 1.0 million, respectively, of unvested stock options was accounted for as a modification and resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2 million and $4 million, respectively, related to additional workforce reductions. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded stock-based compensation expense attributable to our stock options of $2 million and $10 million, respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we

  (in millions, except per share data) 

recorded stock-based compensation expense attributable to our stock options of $4 million and $14 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense was recognized only for options expected to vest, using an estimated forfeiture rate based on historical experience. 
   
  Note 7.        Deferred Compensation Plan    
  We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the  Deferred Plan ) for the purpose of granting cash bonus awards to our employees. The Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is the administrator of the Deferred Plan. The Deferred Plan is funded through a trust (the  Trust ) which is administered by a third-party trustee. The Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee determines cash bonus awards to be granted under the Deferred Plan and the terms of such awards, including vesting schedules. The cash bonus awards are invested by the Trust in our common stock by purchasing shares in the open market. Awards vest contingent on the employee s continued employment or the achievement of performance goals, if any, as determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The Trust provides certain protections of its assets from events other than claims against our assets in the case of bankruptcy. The assets and liabilities of the Trust are consolidated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Shares of our common stock held by the Trust are accounted for as treasury stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  The Deferred Plan does not permit diversification and the cash bonus awards must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of shares of our common stock. The awards under the Deferred Plan are accounted for as grants of unvested stock. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The compensation cost for awards with service conditions is recognized using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. The compensation cost for bonus awards with performance and service conditions is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no grants under the Deferred Plan. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , cash bonus awards of $1 million and $11 million, respectively, were granted under the Deferred Plan.  
  As discussed in   Note 6  , during the first quarter of 2014, we concluded that our Chief Executive Officer had been granted $2.6 million of cash bonus awards in fiscal year 2007 in excess of the annual individual employee limit established in the Deferred Plan. As a result, the $2.6 million of cash bonus awards have been considered null and void. The communication of the $2.6 million of excess cash bonus awards to our Chief Executive Officer resulted in a financial obligation under U.S. GAAP to provide equity compensation commensurate with the terms of the cash bonus awards in return for services to be performed by our Chief Executive Officer during the award vesting period. During the second quarter of 2014, pursuant to the Deferred Plan, an award of $10 million was granted to our Chief Executive Officer that partially settled this financial obligation. During the first quarter of 2015, an award of $7 million was granted to our Chief Executive Officer that settled the remainder of this financial obligation. These grants were funded with shares of common stock from the Trust that had previously been forfeited by former employees prior to being fully vested in their shares. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1 million and $4 million, respectively, attributable to the Deferred Plan. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1 million and $6 million, respectively, attributable to the Deferred Plan.  
  Long Term Incentive Plan Liability 
  European Capital has issued restricted mandatorily redeemable preferred shares ( Redeemable Preferred Shares ) to participating employees of subsidiary companies of its manager, European Capital Asset Management Limited ( ECAM ), a wholly owned subsidiary of ACAM, under Long Term Incentive Plans (the  Plans ) for an issue price determined at the time of issuance. The Plans have a 5-year vesting period. The Redeemable Preferred Shares are subdivided into subclasses of shares. The redemption value of each sub-class of Redeemable Preferred Shares is calculated using a predetermined formula and is based on the net liquidity proceeds, as defined in the Plans, on the exit of specifically referenced investments of European Capital in excess of certain hurdle rates. The Plans have annual calculation and redemption dates through December 31, 2018 and March 1, 2019, respectively, for sub-classes A, B and C and December 31, 2023 and March 1, 2024, respectively, for sub-classes D, E and F. Redeemable Preferred Shares related to specifically referenced investments not exited at the final annual calculation dates will be redeemed after the receipt of subsequent net liquidity proceeds or, if specifically referenced investments that remain outstanding on January 1, 2020 for sub-classes A, B and C and January 1, 2025 for sub-classes D, E and F, will be redeemed based on the realizable value of the remaining referenced investments. European Capital elected to recognize the Redeemable Preferred Shares at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments  . 
  The holders of the Redeemable Preferred Shares have no rights to participate in or receive notice of any general meeting

of European Capital and the shares are generally not transferable. The Redeemable Preferred Shares have no rights to receive dividends.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a portion of the Redeemable Preferred Shares were redeemed and European Capital realized losses of $12 million and $46 million, respectively, associated with the redemptions, which was fully offset by reversals of unrealized depreciation of $12 million and $46 million, respectively, which is included in net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation in our consolidated statements of operations.    
  The fair value of the Redeemable Preferred Shares as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is calculated using the net present value of the estimated future cash flows of the underlying European Capital investments with discounts applied for equity risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, minority interests, lack of marketability and a forfeiture rate.   The fair value of the Redeemable Preferred Shares as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $36 million and $34 million, respectively.   The fair value of the underlying European Capital investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $277 million and $367 million, respectively. 
  There were no shares issued or redeemed for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following tables summarize the number of shares issued and redeemed (in thousands) for the   three months ended   March 31, 2016 and 2015: 

In October 2016, as a result of the exit of all specifically referenced investments related to sub-class C shares, we accelerated the redemption of all sub-class C shares. The redemption value of sub-class C shares was  13.8 million, of which  7.4 million was distributed in October 2016 and the remaining  6.4 million will be distributed in the first quarter of 2017.

Note 8.        Net Operating Income and Net Earnings Per Common Share    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net operating income and net earnings per common share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share  , basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating EPS on a diluted basis. 
  In computing diluted EPS, only potential common shares that are dilutive, those that reduce EPS or increase loss per share, are included. The effect of stock options, unvested employee stock awards and contingently issuable shares are not included if the result would be anti-dilutive, such as when a net loss is reported. Therefore, basic EPS and diluted EPS are computed using the same number of weighted average shares for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as we incurred a net loss for that period. 
  Stock options and unvested shares under our deferred compensation plan of 3.4 million and 13.4 million for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and 36.9 million and 6.2 million for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS either because the respective exercise or grant prices are greater than the average market value of the underlying stock or their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, as determined using the treasury stock method.  
   
  Note 9.        Shareholders  Equity    
  Our common stock activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

Share Repurchase Program 
  Our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of $600 million to $1 billion of common stock through June 30, 2016 at prices per share below 85% of our most recent quarterly NAV per share, subject to certain conditions. We entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to undertake accretive share repurchases on a non-discretionary basis up to the $1 billion limit. On May 16, 2016, our Board of Directors suspended the share repurchase program for an indefinite period, and under the May 23, 2016

Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Ares Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation ( Ares Capital ) and certain of its affiliates described in Note 15 below, we agreed to make no further repurchases of our common stock. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased a total of 32.7 million shares of our common stock in the open market for $477 million at an average price of $14.58 per share. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased a total of 9.7 million shares and 16.2 million shares, respectively, of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate price of $135 million and $227 million, respectively, at an average price of $13.82 per share and $14.02 per share, respectively. 
   
  Note 10.        Income Taxes    
  As a taxable corporation under Subchapter C of the Code, we are subject to federal and applicable state corporate income taxes on our taxable ordinary income and capital gains. However, we estimate that for income tax purposes, we had both net operating loss carryforwards and net long-term capital loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2016. Our tax fiscal year ends on September 30. 
  We file a consolidated federal income tax return with eligible corporate subsidiaries, including portfolio companies in which we hold 80% or more of the outstanding equity interest measured by both vote and fair value. As a result, we have entered into a tax sharing agreement under which members of the consolidated tax group are compensated for losses and other tax benefits by members that are able to use those losses and tax benefits on their pro forma stand-alone federal income tax return. 
  As of September 30, 2016, our deferred tax asset was $664 million, our deferred tax liability was $42 million, our valuation allowance was $366 million and our net deferred tax asset was $256 million. 
  We estimate the expected tax character of recognition of the reversal of the timing differences that give rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities as either ordinary or capital income. However, the ultimate tax character of the deferred tax asset or liability may change from our estimated classification based on the ultimate form of recognition of the timing difference. As of September 30, 2016, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will have future ordinary income to realize the majority of our ordinary deferred tax assets and therefore did not record a valuation allowance against these ordinary deferred tax assets except for a significant portion of our net operating losses ( NOL ) generated in New York City which we expect will expire unutilized and the basis differences of the company s investment in European Capital. As of September 30, 2016, we have recorded a $11 million valuation allowance against a $12 million deferred tax asset related to $144 million of NOLs generated in New York City and $141 million valuation allowance against a $143 million deferred tax asset related to the basis differences from our investment in European Capital.  
  We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our capital deferred tax assets. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we realized a capital loss on our equity investment in European Capital for tax purposes. We believe it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilize this loss in its entirety and therefore have established a valuation allowance against this loss. As of   September 30, 2016  , our capital deferred tax assets were $220 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize $15 million of these capital deferred tax assets and therefore we have established a partial valuation allowance of $205 million against certain capital deferred tax assets.  
  We continue to assess our ability to realize our existing capital deferred tax assets. We believe that due to the recent decision to sell certain investments, these investments that had previously been determined to be long-lived assets will provide a source of taxable income to realize certain capital deferred tax assets. As such, we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize a portion of our capital deferred tax assets associated with taxable income from the sale of these investments. 
  Assessing the recoverability of a deferred tax asset requires management to make estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from investments and operations, the character of expected income or loss as either capital or ordinary, and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows or the amount or character of taxable income differ significantly from these estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, we elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-09. The cumulative effect of the adoption was an increase to the beginning balance of shareholders  equity of $16 million due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits associated with the share based compensation that was unrecorded in previous tax years. The deferred tax asset is ordinary in nature and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will have future sufficient ordinary income to utilize the deferred tax asset. Therefore, we did not establish a valuation allowance against this portion of the ordinary deferred tax asset.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate and our effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. There has been no change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015. We do not reasonably expect any material changes to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 
   
  Note 11.        Commitments and Contingencies    
  In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual agreements that facilitate transactions or provide general indemnifications against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of our obligations under such agreements. We have not had any claims nor made any payments pursuant to such agreements. We cannot estimate the maximum potential exposure under these arrangements as this would involve future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. However, based on our experience, we expect the risk of any material loss to us to be remote.    
  We are a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business, including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  Loan and Financing Agreements 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had commitments under loan and financing agreements to fund up to $72 million to 14 portfolio companies.     These commitments are primarily composed of working capital credit facilities, acquisition credit facilities and subscription agreements. The commitments are generally subject to the borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance with covenants and availability under borrowing base thresholds. The terms of the borrowings and financings subject to commitment are comparable to the terms of other loan and equity securities in our portfolio. As of     September 30, 2016  ,   European Capital and its affiliates had commitments of $45 million to fund European Capital UK SME Debt LP and $75 million to fund European Capital Private Debt LP   ( ECAS Private Debt ).   In addition, as of     September 30, 2016  ,   ACAM had a commitment of $111 million to American Capital Equity III, LP, which is expected to be funded by an equity investment from American Capital. See   Note 13     to our interim consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q     for further discussion of ACAM s American Capital Equity III, LP s commitment.

Note 12.        Significant Subsidiaries    
  We have determined that for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , certain of our unconsolidated portfolio companies have met the conditions of a significant subsidiary under Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 10-01(b)(1) of Regulation S-X, aggregate summarized income statement information for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   has been included as follows: 

Note 13.        Asset Sales    
  On July 1, 2016, European Capital closed on a transaction to sell 100% of its investment in seven European portfolio companies to European Capital Private Equity 1 ( ECPE 1 ) for an aggregate consideration of  90 million ($99 million)  .   ECPE 1 is a predominantly third-party private equity fund focused on investing in French companies in the lower middle market. We do not have an investment in ECPE 1; however, employees of a subsidiary of ACAM are limited partners of the fund and are committed to invest 1% of the aggregate capital commitments of the fund. ECPE 1 is managed by a subsidiary of ACAM for an annual management fee of 1.50% on the aggregate drawdown investor commitments plus any leverage commitments, with a maturity date of June 30, 2021, unless extended or terminated earlier.   During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $99 million of cash proceeds were received, realizing a loss of $46 million, which was partially offset by a reversal of unrealized depreciation of $44 million.    
  ECAS Private Debt is a private debt fund that closed during the second quarter of 2015 with  318 million of capital commitments, of which  165 million was committed by European Capital and its affiliates. The ECAS Private Debt fund provides debt financing to mid-market companies in Europe, primarily through unitranche, second lien and mezzanine financing, with secondary purchases of senior loans on an opportunistic basis. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the ECAS Private Debt fund had an additional closing of  69 million which increased the total capital commitments to  387 million. Upon its final closing in April 2016, the ECAS Private Debt fund raised an additional  86 million which increased the investment capacity of the fund to  473 million. The fund will have a three year investment period and a subsidiary of ACAM manages the ECAS Private Debt fund for an annual management fee of 1.50% on deployed capital. The ECAS Private Debt fund will be dissolved on March 19, 2025, unless extended. In April 2015, European Capital sold  162 million ($175 million) of investments at their approximate fair value in 9 portfolio companies to the ECAS Private Debt fund. European Capital received  158 million ($170 million) for the sale of these assets and recognized a realized loss of  4 million ($5 million). As of   September 30, 2016  , European Capital s investment in the ECAS Private Debt fund had a cost basis and fair value of   $111 million   and   $115 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , European Capital had an unfunded commitment of  66 million ($75 million) to the ECAS Private Debt fund. 
  On April 28, 2014, we completed a $1.1 billion private placement of partnership interests in American Capital Equity III, LP ( ACE III  or  the Fund ), a new private equity fund focused on investing in U.S. companies in the lower middle market. Concurrent with the private placement, we entered into a Contribution and Redemption Agreement with the Fund pursuant to which we agreed to contribute 100% of our equity and equity-related investments in seven portfolio companies to the Fund and to provide the Fund with an option to acquire our equity investment in WRH, Inc. (the  Equity Option ), in exchange for partnership interests in the Fund. Collectively, the eight portfolio companies (including WRH, Inc., assuming the Equity Option is exercised) comprise the Secondary Portfolio for ACE III.

Note 14.        Related Party Transactions    
  As a BDC, we are required by law to make available significant managerial assistance to our eligible portfolio companies. Such assistance typically involves providing guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations and business objectives and policies of the portfolio company to its management and board of directors, including participating on the company s board of directors. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had board seats on 19 companies in our investment portfolio. Providing assistance to the companies in our investment portfolio serves as an opportunity for us to maximize their value. 
  The following table shows the operating revenue from our control investments, as defined under the 1940 Act for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

American Capital Asset Management 
  Our fund management business is conducted through ACAM. In general, ACAM provides investment management services through consolidated subsidiaries that enter into management agreements with each of its managed funds. In addition, American Capital or ACAM may invest directly into these funds and earn investment income from its investments in those funds.     Under the management agreements, ACAM s responsibilities include, but are not limited to, sourcing, analyzing and executing investments and asset sales, delivering financial and compliance reports to investors in the funds under management, administering the daily business and affairs of the funds under management and performing other asset management duties. We have entered into service agreements with ACAM to provide it with additional asset management and administrative services support. Through these agreements, we provide investment advisory and oversight services to ACAM, as well as access to our employees, infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise and capital raising capabilities. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized operating revenues from our investment in ACAM of   $3 million   and   $74 million  , respectively, and   $34 million   and   $103 million  , respectively, for the comparable periods in   2015  . The decrease in operating revenues from our investment in ACAM for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable periods in   2015   was   primarily due to the sale of ACMM on July 1, 2016 and one-time transaction costs of $7 million related to the sale  .   During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   we received an additional $17 million and $24 million, respectively, of dividends from ACAM, which were recorded as a reduction to the cost basis of our investment in ACAM and $3 million and $9 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015.    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we transferred to ACAM 100% of our equity investments in ACEI Singapore Holdings Private LTD, BMR Energy LLC, Hollyhock Limited and Taiba Wind Energy, LLC. As of   September 30, 2016  , the cost basis and fair value of these transferred investments was $74 million and $94 million, respectively.    
  European Capital 
  As discussed in   Note 1   to these consolidated financial statements, we consolidated our investment in European Capital effective October 1, 2014. ACAM, through its subsidiary, ECAM, acts as the investment manager to European Capital. Under ACAM s investment management agreement with European Capital, ACAM is entitled to receive an annual management fee of 2% of the weighted average monthly consolidated gross asset value of all the investments at fair value of European Capital, an incentive fee equal to 100% of the net earnings in excess of a return of 8% but less than a return of 10%, and 20% of the net earnings thereafter. The investment management agreement with European Capital was amended to waive the incentive fee for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, the investment management agreement with European Capital was amended to cancel the incentive fee for 2015 and going forward. The management fee charged by ACAM for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $2 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, and   $3 million   and   $11 million  , respectively, for the comparable periods in   2015  .  
  As discussed in   Note 7   t  o these consolidated financial statements, European Capital has issued Redeemable Preferred Shares to employees of ECAM as part of long-term employee incentive plans. These shares are redeemable by European Capital based on the aggregate returns on investments made after January 1, 2012 and are treated as mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in

our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 480,   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  .   The fair value of the Redeemable Preferred Shares as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $36 million and $34 million, respectively.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a portion of the Redeemable Preferred Shares were redeemed and European Capital realized losses of $12 million and $46 million, respectively, associated with the redemptions, which was fully offset by reversals of unrealized depreciation of $12 million and $46 million, respectively, which is included in net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation in our consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  Note 15.        Acquisition of American Capital 
  On May 23, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Ares Capital, under which Ares Capital will acquire American Capital in a cash and stock transaction (the  Acquisition ). As of May 20, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Acquisition, the transaction had an implied value of approximately $4.0 billion, or $17.40 per fully diluted share of our common stock.   As of September 30, 2016,   the transaction had an implied value of approximately   $4.0 billion, or $17.55   per fully diluted share of our common stock   based on the trading price of Ares Capital s common stock. 
  Upon the completion of the Acquisition, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition will be converted into the right to receive from Ares Capital, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (i) $6.41 per share in cash consideration, (ii) stock consideration at the fixed exchange ratio of 0.483 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of Ares Capital s common stock (subject to the payment of cash instead of fractional shares) (the  Exchange Ratio ), (iii) $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of American Capital s common stock and (iv) $2.45 per share in cash, or $562 million, which amount represents the per share cash consideration paid to American Capital pursuant to the sale of   ACMM  , a wholly owned subsidiary of ACAM to American Capital Agency Corp. ( AGNC ).     
  Additionally, depending on the effective time of the Acquisition, each share of American Capital s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction will be converted into the right to receive, if any, the make-up dividend amount. The make-up dividend amount would equal (A) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to Ares Capital s dividend payable with respect to the fourth quarter of 2016, 37.5% of the Exchange Ratio times Ares Capital s dividend for such quarter, plus (B) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to Ares Capital's dividend payable with respect to the first quarter of 2017, 75% of the Exchange Ratio times Ares Capital s dividend for such quarter, plus (C) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to Ares Capital's dividend for any subsequent quarter, 100% of the Exchange Ratio times Ares Capital s dividend for such quarter. The Exchange Ratio was fixed on the date of the Merger Agreement, and is not subject to adjustment based on changes in the trading price of Ares Capital s or American Capital s common stock before the closing of the transaction. Based on the fully diluted number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the date of the Merger Agreement, the above would result in approximately 110.8 million of Ares Capital s shares being exchanged for approximately 229.3 million outstanding shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain limited circumstances  .    
  While there can be no assurances as to the exact timing, or that the transaction will be completed at all, Ares Capital has indicated that it expects to complete the transaction as early as the first week of January 2017. The completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, our stockholder approval, Ares Capital stockholder approval, required regulatory approvals (including from certain regulatory authorities), receipt of certain third-party consents, including third-party consents from certain investment funds managed by ACAM and its subsidiaries representing at least 75% of the aggregate assets under management of all such funds as of March 31, 2016 and other customary closing conditions.    
  Additionally, on May 23, 2016, Ares Capital entered into an agreement with Ares Capital Management LLC, its investment adviser (the  Transaction Support Agreement ) in connection with the Acquisition. Under the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement, Ares Capital s investment adviser will (i) provide $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of American Capital s common stock (as referenced above), payable to American Capital stockholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement at closing and (ii) waive, for each of the first ten calendar quarters beginning with the first full calendar quarter after the closing of the Acquisition, the lesser of $10 million of income based fees and the amount of income based fees for such quarter, in each case, to the extent earned and payable by Ares Capital in such quarter pursuant to and as calculated under Ares Capital s investment advisory and management agreement. The financial support contemplated by the Transaction Support Agreement is conditioned upon completion of the Acquisition, which is subject to the closing conditions described above.

Sale of American Capital Mortgage Management, LLC 
  Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on May 23, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement ) with ACAM, ACMM and AGNC. ACMM is the parent company of both American Capital AGNC Management, LLC, the external manager of AGNC, and American Capital MTGE Management, LLC, the external manager of American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp.     Immediately prior to the closing, as defined in the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement, our $35 million debt investment in ACMM was settled by ACMM in connection with an equity contribution from ACAM to ACMM. On July 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement, AGNC acquired from ACAM all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in ACMM for a purchase price of $562 million, or $2.45 per diluted share.    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a net realized gain of $386 million on the sale of ACMM, which is recorded in the net realized gain (loss) section in our consolidated statements of operations. This was fully offset by a reversal of unrealized appreciation of $386 million, which is recorded in the net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation section in our consolidated statements of operations.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     (in millions, except per share data) 
     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is designed to provide a reader of American Capital s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. Our MD A is presented in four sections: 
     Executive Overview

     Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
     Forward-Looking Statements 
   
  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
  American Capital, Ltd. (which is referred to throughout this report as  American Capital ,  we ,  our  and  us ) is a publicly traded global asset manager and private equity firm. American Capital, both directly and through our asset management business, has originated, underwritten and managed investments in middle market private equity, leveraged finance, real estate, energy and structured products. It has been our practice to sell some of the assets that we originate as an investor into funds that we manage. On August 29, 1997, we completed an initial public offering and became a non-diversified closed end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ( 1940 Act ). As a BDC, we have invested primarily in senior and mezzanine debt and equity in buyouts of private companies sponsored by us ( American Capital One Stop Buyouts        ) or sponsored by other private equity funds and have provided capital directly to early stage and mature private and small public companies ( Sponsor Finance and Other Investments ). We also have invested in structured finance investments ( Structured Products ), including collateralized loan obligation ( CLO ) securities. Our primary business objectives have been to increase our net earnings and net asset value ( NAV ) by making investments with attractive current yields and/ or potential for equity appreciation and realized gains and by growing our fee earning assets under management. 
  As described further below, on May 23, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Ares Capital Corporation ( Ares Capital ) and certain of its affiliates, under which Ares Capital will acquire us. The Merger Agreement effectively prohibits us from originating most new investments and restricts us from exiting certain investments and taking other actions with regard to our business, thus significantly changing the character of our operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we managed   $10 billion   of assets, including assets on our balance sheet and fee earning assets under management by affiliated managers, with   $10 billion   of total assets under management (including levered assets). Our asset management business is conducted through our wholly-owned portfolio company, American Capital Asset Management, LLC ( ACAM ), a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As of   September 30, 2016  , ACAM managed the following funds:  
             
    American Capital Senior Floating, Ltd. ( ACSF ) 
                
    American Capital Equity I, LLC ( ACE I ) 
                
    American Capital Equity II, LP ( ACE II ) 
                
    American Capital Equity III, LP ( ACE III ) 
                
    European Capital UK SME Debt LP ( ECAS UK SME Debt ) 
                
    European Capital Private Debt LP ( ECAS Private Debt ) 
                
    European Capital Private Equity I ( ECPE 1 ) 
                
    American Capital CLO Fund I, LP ( ACAS CLO Fund I )

ACAS CLO IX, Ltd. ( ACAS CLO IX ) 
     We are taxed as a corporation and pay federal and applicable state corporate taxes on our taxable income. From 1997 through the tax year ended September 30, 2010, we were taxed as a regulated investment company ( RIC ), as defined in Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). As a RIC, we were not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and capital gains we distributed to our shareholders, but we were also not able to carry forward net operating losses ( NOL ) from year to year. Beginning with our tax year ended September 30, 2011, our status changed from a RIC subject to taxation under Subchapter M to a corporation subject to taxation under Subchapter C. Under Subchapter C, we are able to carry forward any NOLs historically incurred to succeeding years, which we would not be able to do if we were subject to taxation as a RIC under the Code. This change in tax status does not affect our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act or our compliance with the portfolio composition requirements of that statute. 
  Recent Developments 
  Acquisition of American Capital  
  On May 23, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Ares Capital, under which Ares Capital will acquire American Capital in a cash and stock transaction (the  Acquisition ). As of May 20, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Acquisition, the transaction had an implied value of approximately $4.0 billion, or $17.40 per fully diluted share of our common stock.   As of September 30, 2016,   the transaction had an implied value of approximately   $4.0 billion, or $17.55   per fully diluted share of our common stock  . 
  Upon the completion of the Acquisition, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition will be converted into the right to receive from Ares Capital, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (i) $6.41 per share in cash consideration, (ii) stock consideration at the fixed exchange ratio of 0.483 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of Ares Capital s common stock (subject to the payment of cash instead of fractional shares) (the  Exchange Ratio ), (iii) $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of American Capital s common stock and (iv) $2.45 per share in cash, or $562 million, which amount represents the per share cash consideration paid to American Capital pursuant to the sale of   American Capital Mortgage Management, LLC ( ACMM )  , a wholly owned subsidiary of ACAM to American Capital Agency Corp. ( AGNC ). 
  Additionally, depending on the effective time of the Acquisition, each share of American Capital s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction will be converted into the right to receive, if any, the make-up dividend amount. The make-up dividend amount would equal (A) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to Ares Capital s dividend payable with respect to the fourth quarter of 2016, 37.5% of the Exchange Ratio times Ares Capital s dividend for such quarter, plus (B) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to Ares Capital's dividend payable with respect to the first quarter of 2017, 75% of the Exchange Ratio times Ares Capital s dividend for such quarter, plus (C) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to Ares Capital's dividend for any subsequent quarter, 100% of the Exchange Ratio times Ares Capital s dividend for such quarter. The Exchange Ratio was fixed on the date of the Merger Agreement, and is not subject to adjustment based on changes in the trading price of Ares Capital s or American Capital s common stock before the closing of the transaction. Based on the fully diluted number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the date of the Merger Agreement, the above would result in approximately 110.8 million of Ares Capital s shares being exchanged for approximately 229.3 million outstanding shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain limited circumstances  . 
  Additionally, on May 23, 2016, Ares Capital entered into an agreement with Ares Capital Management LLC, its investment adviser (the  Transaction Support Agreement ) in connection with the Acquisition. Under the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement, Ares Capital s investment adviser will (i) provide $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of American Capital s common stock (as referenced above), payable to American Capital stockholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement at closing and (ii) waive, for each of the first ten calendar quarters beginning with the first full calendar quarter after the closing of the Acquisition, the lesser of $10 million of income based fees and the amount of income based fees for such quarter, in each case, to the extent earned and payable by Ares Capital in such quarter pursuant to and as calculated under Ares Capital s investment advisory and management agreement. The financial support contemplated by the Transaction Support Agreement is conditioned upon completion of the Acquisition, which is subject to the closing conditions described above. 
  The Merger Agreement contains (a) customary representations and warranties of American Capital and Ares Capital, including representations and warranties relating to, among others: corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority and absence of conflicts, third-party and governmental consents and approvals, reports and regulatory matters, financial statements, compliance with law and legal proceedings, absence of certain changes, taxes, employee matters, intellectual property, insurance and certain contracts, (b) limited representations and warranties from Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P. and ACAM, including representations and warranties relating to, among others: corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority and absence  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

of conflicts, (c) limited representations and warranties from Ares Capital s investment adviser, including representations and warranties relating to, among others: corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority, absence of conflicts and regulatory matters, (d) covenants of American Capital and Ares Capital to conduct our respective businesses in the ordinary course until the Acquisition is completed and (e) covenants of American Capital and Ares Capital not to take certain actions during this interim period. 
  Among other things, American Capital and Ares Capital have agreed to, and will cause our respective affiliates, consolidated subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers, directors, managers, employees and other advisors, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations with respect to a Competing Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) from a third-party and not to directly or indirectly solicit or take any other action (including providing information) with the intent to solicit any inquiry, discussion, proposal or offer with respect to a Competing Proposal. 
  However, if either American Capital or Ares Capital receives a Competing Proposal from a third-party, and the board of directors of American Capital or Ares Capital, as applicable, determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and independent financial advisers that (i) failure to consider such proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors under applicable law and (ii) the Competing Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), then the party receiving such proposal may engage in discussions and negotiations with such third-party so long as certain notice and other procedural requirements are satisfied. American Capital or Ares Capital may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with a third-party who makes a Superior Proposal, subject to certain procedural requirements and the payment of a $140 million termination fee. 
  The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement (a) have been qualified by confidential disclosures made to the other party in connection with the Merger Agreement, (b) will not survive completion of the Acquisition and cannot be the basis for any claims under the Merger Agreement by the other party after the Acquisition is completed, (c) are qualified in certain circumstances by a materiality standard which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors, (d) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement and (e) may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between American Capital and Ares Capital rather than establishing matters as facts. 
  While there can be no assurances as to the exact timing, or that the transaction will be completed at all, Ares Capital has indicated that it expects to complete the transaction as early as the first week of January 2017. The completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, our stockholder approval, Ares Capital stockholder approval, required regulatory approvals (including from certain regulatory authorities), receipt of certain third-party consents, including third-party consents from certain investment funds managed by ACAM and its subsidiaries representing at least 75% of the aggregate assets under management of all such funds as of March 31, 2016 and other customary closing conditions. 
  Sale of American Capital Mortgage Management, LLC 
  Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on May 23, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement ) with ACAM, ACMM and AGNC. ACMM is the parent company of both American Capital AGNC Management, LLC, the external manager of AGNC, and American Capital MTGE Management, LLC, the external manager of American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp.   ( MTGE ).   Immediately prior to the closing, as defined in the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement, our $35 million debt investment in ACMM was settled by ACMM in connection with an equity contribution from ACAM to ACMM. On July 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement, AGNC acquired from ACAM all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in ACMM for a purchase price of $562 million, or $2.45 per diluted share. 
  Investment Portfolio  
  As an investor, we have invested primarily in senior and mezzanine debt and equity of middle and large market companies. We and ACAM have also invested in assets that can be sold or contributed to public or private funds that ACAM could manage, as a means of  incubating  such funds. We also have investments in Structured Products and in funds managed by us. 
  Portfolio Composition  
  Our investments can be divided into the following six business lines: (i) American Capital One Stop Buyouts       , (ii) Sponsor Finance and Other Investments, (iii) European Capital, (iv) American Capital Asset Management, (v) Structured Products and (vi) Senior Floating Rate Loans.

American Capital One Stop Buyouts       
  In an American Capital One Stop Buyout       , we lend senior and mezzanine debt and make majority equity investments to finance our acquisition of an operating company through a change in control. A change in control transaction could be the result of a corporate divestiture, a sale by a private equity firm, a sale by a family-owned closely held business, going private transactions or ownership transitions. In addition, we may make additional add-on investments in our American Capital One Stop Buyouts        to finance strategic acquisitions, growth or for working capital. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   12   companies in our American Capital One Stop Buyouts          portfolio with a cost basis and fair value of   $738 million   and   $565 million  , respectively, with an average investment size of   $47 million   at fair value. As of   September 30, 2016  , our American Capital One Stop Buyouts        portfolio consisted of   $465 million   and   $100 million   of debt and equity investments at fair value, respectively.

  As a BDC, we are required by law to make significant managerial assistance available to most of our portfolio companies. This generally includes providing guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations and business objectives and policies of the portfolio company to its management and board of directors, including participating on the company s board of directors.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had board seats at 11 companies in our American Capital One Stop Buyouts        portfolio and had board observation rights at certain companies. Providing assistance to the companies in our investment portfolio serves as an opportunity for us to maximize their value. 
  Sponsor Finance and Other Investments 
  The majority of the investments in our Sponsor Finance and Other Investments portfolio were originated either to assist in the funding of change of control buyouts of privately-held middle and large market companies sponsored by other private equity firms or to support the growth or recapitalization of an existing portfolio company. In these transactions, we generally lend senior, mezzanine and unitranche debt and make minority equity co-investments. We will generally invest between $10 million and $150

million in a single Sponsor Finance transaction. Generally, we make investments in companies that have a minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of $10 million. 
  Our senior loans may consist of first lien secured revolving credit facilities, first and second lien secured term loans and unitranche loans. Our mezzanine loans may consist of secured and unsecured loans. Our loans typically mature in five to ten years and require monthly or quarterly interest payments at fixed rates or variable rates generally based on London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), plus a margin. Certain of our loans permit the interest to be paid-in-kind ( PIK ) by adding it to the outstanding loan balance and paid at maturity. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   47   companies in our Sponsor Finance and Other Investments portfolio with a cost basis and fair value of   $1,554 million   and   $1,465 million  , respectively, with an average investment size of   $31 million   at fair value.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , ACAM had over 75 employees, including nine investment teams with over 50 investment professionals located in Bethesda (Maryland), New York, Annapolis (Maryland), London and Paris. We have entered into service agreements with ACAM to provide it with additional asset management and administrative services support. Through these agreements, we provide investment advisory and oversight services to ACAM, as well as access to our employees, infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise and capital raising capabilities. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , American Capital earned   $3 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, from ACAM for these services. ACAM generally earns base management fees based on the shareholders  equity or the net cost basis of the assets of the funds under management and may earn incentive income, or a carried interest, based on the performance of the funds. In addition, American Capital or ACAM may invest directly into these funds and earn investment income from its investments in those funds. In accordance with the 1940 Act, our management agreement with ACSF terminates automatically upon assignment. The term  assignment  is broadly defined under the 1940 Act and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in us. Also, in accordance with the Advisers Act, none of our management agreements may be assigned without the respective fund s consent in addition to any other restrictions on assignment set forth therein. 
  As discussed above and in   Note 15     to our interim consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q  , on May 23, 2016, we entered into the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement with ACAM, ACMM and AGNC. Immediately prior to the closing, as defined in the Mortgage Manager Purchase Agreement, our $35 million debt investment in ACMM was settled by ACMM in connection with an equity contribution from ACAM to ACMM. On July 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage

  Structured Products Investments 
  Our Structured Products investments consist of investments in CLO and CDO securities. Our Structured Products investments are generally in non-investment grade securities. We invest in Structured Products with the intention of holding them until maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , our Structured Products investments had a cost basis and fair value of   $502 million   and   $369 million  , respectively, or   11%   of our total investments at fair value. This includes our investment in ACAS CLO 2007-1, which represents   $20 million   at fair value. 
  Senior Floating Rate Loans 
  Our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio was composed primarily of diversified investments in first lien floating rate loans to large-market U.S. based companies (defined as issuers with EBITDA greater than $50 million). Senior Floating Rate Loans are typically collateralized by a company s assets and structured with first lien or second lien priority on collateral, providing for greater security and potential recovery in the event of default compared to other subordinated fixed-income products. Senior Floating Rate Loans generally have a stated term of three to seven years and typically pay interest based on a floating rate calculated as a spread over a market index, primarily LIBOR, and generally have a minimum market index floor. Our Senior Floating Rate Loans were also typically traded among investors in an active secondary market with no investor owning a significant percentage of the issue.

     Table of Contents  

We initiated our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio in 2014 and purchased $3.0 billion of investments through December 31, 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we substantially liquidated our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio. During the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio.   Since 2014, we have received $3.5 billion in proceeds from the sale of these investments. The proceeds from the sale of our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio were partially utilized to pay down obligations under the $1.25 billion secured revolving credit facility and $500 million secured revolving credit facility.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we realized a loss of $8 million from our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio, which was partially offset by a reversal of unrealized depreciation of $7 million. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized interest income and interest expense from our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio totaling   $24 million   and $8 million, respectively.

  On July 1, 2016, European Capital closed on a transaction to sell 100% of its investment in seven European portfolio companies to European Capital Private Equity 1 ( ECPE 1 ) for an aggregate consideration of  90 million ($99 million).  
  ECPE 1 is a predominantly third-party private equity fund focused on investing in French companies in the lower middle market. We do not have an investment in ECPE 1; however, employees of a subsidiary of ACAM are limited partners of the fund and are committed to invest 1% of the aggregate capital commitments of the fund. ECPE 1 is managed by a subsidiary of ACAM for an annual management fee of 1.50% on the aggregate drawdown investor commitments plus any leverage commitments, with a maturity date of June 30, 2021, unless extended or terminated earlier.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon our financial results. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following require estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results: valuation of investments; income taxes; interest and dividend income recognition; and stock-based compensation. All of our critical accounting policies are fully described in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  See   Note 4     to our interim consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q   for further information regarding the classification of our investment portfolio by levels of fair value inputs used to measure our investments as of   September 30, 2016  .

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
  Our consolidated financial performance, as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations, is composed of the following three primary elements: 
             
    The first element is  Net operating income  ( NOI ), which is primarily the interest, dividends, prepayment fees, finance and transaction fees and portfolio company management fees earned from investing in debt and equity securities and the fees we earn from fund asset management, less our operating expenses and provision or benefit for income taxes. 
                
    The second element is  Net realized gain (loss),  which reflects the difference between the proceeds from an exit of an investment and the cost at which the investment was carried on our consolidated balance sheets and periodic interest settlements and termination receipts or payments on derivatives, foreign currency transaction gains or losses and taxes on realized gains or losses. 
                
    The third element is  Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation),  which is the net change in the estimated fair value of our portfolio investments and of our interest rate derivatives at the end of the period compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period or their stated costs, as appropriate, and taxes on unrealized gains or losses. In addition, our net unrealized depreciation includes the foreign currency translation from converting the cost basis of our assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. dollar.  
     The consolidated operating results were as follows (in millions):

Operating Revenue 
  We derive the majority of our operating revenue from our investments in senior and mezzanine debt and equity of middle market companies and our investments in Structured Products, as well as dividend income from our fund management business which is conducted through ACAM.  
  Operating Revenue by Business Line 
  Operating revenue by business line was as follows (in millions): 

Sponsor Finance and Other Investments 
  Interest, dividend and fee income from our Sponsor Finance and Other Investments   increased   by   $9 million  , or   28%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in our weighted average debt investments at cost in our Sponsor Finance and Other portfolio, which was partially offset by a negative impact from non-accrual investments during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable period in   2015  . Interest, dividend and fee income from our Sponsor Finance and Other Investments increased by   $80 million  , or   91%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to a $530 million increase in our weighted average debt investments at cost in our Sponsor Finance and Other portfolio. 
  American Capital Asset Management 
  Interest, dividend and fee income from ACAM     decreased   by   $31 million  , or   91%  , and by   $29 million  , or   28%  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  ,   primarily due to the sale of ACMM on July 1, 2016 and one-time transaction costs of $7 million related to the sale  . 
  Structured Products  
  Interest income on Structured Products investments   increased   by   $5 million  , or   21%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to higher actual and projected payments. Interest income on Structured Products investments   decreased   by   $10 million  , or   12%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to exits, which was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher actual and projected payments. During   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we realized cash proceeds of   $17 million   and recognized interest income of   $29 million   from our Structured Products investments. During   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we realized cash proceeds of   $87 million   and recognized interest income of   $71 million   from our Structured Products investments. 
  Interest income on Structured Products is recognized using the effective interest method as required by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Subtopic 325-40,   Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets   ( ASC 325-40 ). Under ASC 325-40, at the time of purchase, we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective yield of an investment based on these estimated cash flows and the cost basis of the investment. Subsequent to the purchase, these estimated cash flows are updated quarterly and a revised effective yield is calculated prospectively in accordance with FASB ASC 320-10-35,   Investment-Debt and Equity Securities.   In the event that the fair value of an investment decreases below its current amortized cost basis, we may be required to write down the current amortized cost basis for a credit loss or to fair value depending on our hold expectations for the investment. Current amortized cost basis less the amount of any write down ( Reference Amount ) is used to calculate the effective yield used for interest income recognition purposes over the remaining life of the investment. We are precluded from reversing write downs for any subsequent increase in the expected cash flows of an investment with the effect of increasing total interest income over the life of the investment and increasing the realized loss recorded on the sale or redemption of the investment by the amount of the credit loss write down. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we did not record credit loss write downs on our Structured Products investments. During the   nine  
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  

months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded $10 million in credit loss write downs on sixteen Structured Products investments. As of   September 30, 2016  , in aggregate, the amortized cost basis of our Structured Products investment portfolio exceeded the Reference Amount by $106 million. 
  See Note 2   Interest and Dividend Income Recognition policy in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a description of how projected cash flows affect revenue recognition on our Structured Products investments. 
  American Capital One Stop Buyouts       
  Interest, dividend and fee income from our American Capital One Stop Buyouts        decreased   by   $38 million  , or   78%  , and by   $54 million  , or   47%  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to exits as well as a negative impact from non-accrual investments during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable periods in   2015  . 
  European Capital 
  European Capital s operating revenue for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $10 million   and   $23 million  , respectively, comprised of $4 million and $7 million of interest income on European Capital debt investments, respectively, and $6 million and $16 million of dividend income on European Capital equity investments, respectively. European Capital s operating revenue for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $13 million   and   $43 million  , respectively, comprised of $9 million and $25 million of interest income on European Capital debt investments, respectively, $3 million and $15 million of dividend income on European Capital equity investments, respectively, and $1 million and $3 million of income on European Capital CLO investments, respectively. The decrease in European Capital s operating revenue for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable periods in   2015   was primarily due to a decrease in its weighted average debt investments at cost. 
   For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , European Capital recorded additional interest income on uncollected PIK interest income recorded in prior periods of $3 million and $4 million, respectively, as a result of debt investments being removed from non-accrual. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , European Capital recorded additional interest income on uncollected PIK interest income recorded in prior periods of $5 million and $9 million, respectively, as a result of debt investments being removed from non-accrual. 
  Senior Floating Rate Loans 
  We initiated our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio in 2014 and purchased $3.0 billion of investments through December 31, 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we substantially liquidated our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio. During the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio.

  Debt Investments 
    
  Interest income on debt investments   decreased   by   $31 million  , or   40%  , and by   $51 million  , or   25%  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in interest income on our Senior Floating Rate Loan portfolio of   $24 million   and   $67 million  , respectively, which was partially offset by an increase in our weighted average debt investments outstanding at cost. Our weighted average debt investments outstanding at cost, excluding Senior Floating Rate Loans,   increased   by   $30 million   and   $308 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily as a result of new Sponsor Finance investments. The average non-accrual debt investments outstanding   increased   from   $179 million   and   $186 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, to   $194 million   and   $190 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual, we may record reserves on uncollected PIK interest income recorded in prior periods as a reduction of interest income in the current period. Conversely, when a debt investment is removed from non-accrual, we may record interest income in the current period on prior period uncollected PIK interest income which was reserved in prior periods. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded additional interest income on uncollected PIK interest income recorded in prior periods of $5 million as a result of debt investments being removed from non-accrual, which had an approximate   30 basis point     positive impact   on the effective interest rate on debt investments. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded additional interest income on uncollected PIK interest income recorded in prior periods of $5 million and $6 million, respectively, as a result of debt investments being removed from non-accrual, which had an approximate   100 basis point   and   50 basis point   positive impact, respectively, on the effective interest rate on debt investments.

Equity Investments, Excluding ACAM 
  Dividend income from equity investments, excluding ACAM,   decreased   by   $23 million  , or   100%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to exits as well as a negative non-accrual impact on preferred equity investments. Dividend income from equity investments, excluding ACAM,   increased   by   $4 million  , or   9%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to an $18 million increase in dividend income for non-recurring dividends, which was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income due to exits as well as a negative non-accrual impact on preferred equity investments. As a result, the monthly weighted average effective dividend yield on equity investments was   0.7%   and   11.9%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  When a preferred equity investment is placed on non-accrual, we may record net reserves on uncollected accrued dividend income recorded in prior periods as a reduction of dividend income in the current period. Conversely, when a preferred equity investment is removed from non-accrual, we may record dividend income in the current period for prior period uncollected accrued dividend income which was reserved in prior periods. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded reserves on accrued PIK dividend income recorded in prior periods from preferred stock investments of $5 million, which had an approximate   570 basis point     negative impact   on the effective dividend yield on equity investments. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded dividend income for the reversal of reserves on accrued PIK dividend income attributable to prior periods from preferred stock investments of $12 million, which had an approximate   300 basis point     positive impact   on the effective dividend yield on equity investments. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded dividend income for the reversal of reserves of accrued PIK dividend income attributable to prior periods from preferred stock investments of $12 million and $19 million, respectively, which had an approximate   570 basis point   and   280 basis point     positive impact  , respectively, on the effective dividend yield on equity investments. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded $5 million and $29 million of dividend income for non-recurring dividends on equity investments, respectively, and $5 million and $11 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in   2015  . 
  Equity Investments - ACAM 
    
  Dividend income from ACAM   decreased   by   $28 million  , or   100%  , and by   $23 million  , or   28%  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  ,   primarily due to the sale of ACMM on July 1, 2016 and one-time transaction costs of $7 million related to the sale  . 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   we received an additional $17 million and $24 million, respectively, of dividends from ACAM, which were recorded as a reduction to the cost basis of our investment in ACAM and $3 million and $9 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015.

This generally includes providing guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations and business objectives and policies of the portfolio company to its management and board of directors, including participating on the company s board of directors.   Our portfolio company advisory and administrative fees for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $3 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, and   $3 million   and   $11 million  , respectively, for the comparable periods in   2015  . 
    
  Advisory and Administrative Services - ACAM 
    
  We have entered into service agreements with ACAM to provide additional asset management and administrative service support so that ACAM can fulfill its responsibilities under its management agreements. The fees generated from these service agreements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $3 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, and   $5 million   and   $20 million  , respectively, for the comparable periods in   2015  . 
    
  Other Fees 
    
  Other fees are primarily composed of transaction fees for structuring, financing and executing portfolio transactions, which may not be recurring in nature. These fees amounted to   $2 million   and   $14 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $3 million   and   $13 million  , respectively, for the comparable periods in   2015  .

Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses decreased by   $26 million  , or   38%  , and by   $34 million  , or   16%  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  . Operating expenses consisted of the following (in millions):  

Interest 
  Interest expense   decreased   by   $16 million  , or   76%  , and by   $23 million  , or   40%  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in the daily weighted average debt balance.   The weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings, including amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs and discounts, for the     three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     was     6.9% and 6.5%, respectively, compared to 3.7% and 3.6%, respectively, for the comparable periods in     2015  .   The weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts, for the     three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     was     6.5% and 4.9%, respectively, compared to 3.1% and 3.1%, respectively, for the comparable periods in     2015  .

  Salaries, Benefits and Stock-based Compensation and Severance Related Costs 
  Salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation consisted of the following (in millions): 

Salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and severance related costs   decreased   by   $7 million  , or   23%  , and   $18 million  , or   17%  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to a reduction in base salaries, stock-based compensation and incentive compensation due to workforce reductions.  
  Due to changes in the composition of our investment portfolio and market conditions, we conducted strategic reviews of our business in the fourth quarter of 2014, which resulted in workforce reductions and the closing of two of our offices as well as the elimination of certain functions at other offices. In conjunction with the restructuring, the vesting of any unvested stock options held by impacted employees as of the date of their separation was accelerated, and they were given a period of up to one year from their separation date, or less if the expiration of the option was within one year from their separation date, to exercise all outstanding options. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded charges for both severance and related employee costs of $8 million, including $2 million from the modification of stock options and $6 million of severance costs for additional workforce reductions during   2016  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded charges for severance and related employee costs of   $10 million  , including $4 million from the modification of stock options and $6 million for severance costs for additional workforce reductions during 2015. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we employed 233 full-time employees, which included 79 employees at ACAM, compared to 362 full-time employees as of   September 30, 2015  . Compensation expense for ACAM employees is not included in our consolidated expenses as the financial results of ACAM are not consolidated with our financial results.

The tax provision - net operating income decreased by $15 million and $28 million, respectively, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in PIK dividend accruals as PIK dividends are treated as capital in nature and recorded at an effective tax rate of 0%, as compared to ordinary interest and dividends, which have an effective tax rate of approximately 39%. Additionally, the effective tax rate was reduced for certain non-recurring dividends on equity investments received during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   that were excluded from taxable income. 
  The tax (provision) benefit - net realized gain (loss) decreased by $179 million and $218 million, respectively, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to the relative amounts of realizations treated as losses that reduce ordinary income, which have an effective tax rate of 39%, as compared to capital losses, which have an effective tax rate of 0%. 
  The tax benefit - net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation increased by $176 million and $304 million, respectively, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , over the comparable periods in   2015  , primarily due to the relative amounts of unrealized appreciation that will be treated as ordinary income, which have an effective tax rate of 39%, as compared to realizations that are capital, which have an effective tax rate of 0%.

European Capital 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $81 million   and   $96 million  , respectively, of   net unrealized appreciation   on the consolidated European Capital investment portfolio primarily driven by a company that is in a sales process and specific company performance. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded   $26 million   and   $34 million  , respectively, of   net unrealized appreciation   on the consolidated European Capital investment portfolio.

  For foreign currency denominated investments recorded at fair value, such as our European Capital portfolio investments, the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation from foreign currency translation on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations represents the economic impact of translating the cost basis of the investment from a foreign currency, such as the Euro, to the U.S. dollar. However, the economic impact of translating the cumulative unrealized appreciation or depreciation from a foreign currency to the U.S. dollar is not recorded as net unrealized depreciation or appreciation from foreign currency translation but rather is included as net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of portfolio company investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
  American Capital Asset Management, LLC 
  ACAM had a cost basis and fair value of   $432 million   and   $440 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $25 million   of   unrealized appreciation   on our investment in ACAM primarily driven by assets that are currently in a sales process as well as appreciation related to other ACAM managed funds. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $154 million   of   unrealized depreciation   on our investment in ACAM, primarily due to the sale of ACMM on July 1, 2016, offset by appreciation driven by assets that are currently in a sales process as well as appreciation related to ACAM s managed CLOs. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $55 million   and   $69 million  , respectively, of   unrealized depreciation     on our investment in ACAM primarily due to a reduction in projected management fees for managing AGNC and MTGE due to a decrease in the equity capital of each company as a result of share repurchases and realized losses. 
  Structured Products Investments  
  American Capital has investments in Structured Products with a cost basis and fair value of   $502 million   and   $369 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we collected cash proceeds of $46 million and $158 million, respectively, from Structured Products investments, of which   $17 million   and   $87 million  , respectively, was deemed a return of capital and   $29 million   and   $71 million  , respectively, was recognized as interest income. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we collected cash proceeds of $46 million and $207 million, respectively, from our Structured Products investments, of which   $22 million   and   $126 million  , respectively, was deemed a return of capital and   $24 million   and   $81 million  , respectively, was recognized as interest income.

During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded   $45 million   and   $59 million  , respectively, of   net unrealized depreciation   in Structured Products investments primarily due to a decline in forecasted cash flows and lower dealer marks in our CLO portfolio. 
  Derivative Agreements and Other and WRH, Inc. Equity Option 
  For interest rate agreements, we estimate the fair value based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward interest rate yield curve in effect as of the end of the measurement period, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any, including an evaluation of our credit risk and our counterparty s credit risk. A negative fair value would represent an amount we would have to pay a third-party and a positive fair value would represent an amount we would receive from a third-party to assume our obligation under an interest rate agreement. The derivative agreements generally appreciate or depreciate primarily based on relative market interest rates and their remaining term to maturity as well as changes in our and our counterparty s credit risk. 
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $4 million   of   net unrealized depreciation   from derivative agreements and other, primarily due to unrealized depreciation on Redeemable Preferred Shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded $28 million of unrealized appreciation on the WRH, Inc. Equity Option due to the reversal of unrealized depreciation from ACE III s exercising of the Equity Option on April 1, 2015. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   $3 million   and   $44 million  , respectively, of   net unrealized appreciation   from derivative agreements and other, primarily due to the reversal of unrealized depreciation on the redemption of Redeemable Preferred Shares.

However, a majority of our investments are generally illiquid and no active primary or secondary market exists for the trading of these investments and our estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that may be ultimately realized. We are generally repaid or exit our investments upon a change of control event of the portfolio company, such as a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $1,710 million  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by financing activities was   $759 million  .

Our cash flow from financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily from proceeds received on our revolving credit facilities of   $1,086 million   partially offset by   $227 million   for repurchases of our common stock and $138 million of payments on our secured borrowings. 
  Debt Capital

  Equity Capital 
  As a BDC, we are generally not able to issue or sell our common stock at a price below our NAV per share, exclusive of any distributing commission or discount, except (i) with the prior approval of a majority of our shareholders, (ii) in connection with a rights offering to our existing shareholders, or (iii) under such other circumstances as the SEC may permit. As of   September 30, 2016  , our NAV was   $21.40 per share   and our closing market price was   $16.91 per share  .    
  Our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of $600 million to $1 billion of common stock through June 30, 2016 at prices per share below 85% of our most recent quarterly NAV per share, subject to certain conditions. We entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to undertake accretive share repurchases on a non-discretionary basis up to the $1 billion limit. On May 16, 2016, our Board of Directors suspended the share repurchase program for an indefinite period, and under the Merger Agreement, we agreed to make no further repurchases of our common stock.

Commitments    
     As of September 30, 2016, we had commitments under loan and financing agreements to fund up to $72 million to 14 portfolio companies.     These commitments are primarily composed of working capital credit facilities, acquisition credit facilities and subscription agreements. The commitments are generally subject to the borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance with covenants and availability under borrowing base thresholds. The terms of the borrowings and financings subject to commitment are comparable to the terms of other loan and equity securities in our portfolio. As of     September 30, 2016  ,   European Capital and its affiliates had commitments of $45 million to fund European Capital UK SME Debt LP and $75 million to fund European Capital Private Debt LP  .

  Non-Performing Loans Analysis 
  We stop accruing interest on our debt investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Our valuation analysis serves as a critical piece of data in this determination. A significant change in the portfolio company valuation assigned by us could have an effect on the amount of our loans on non-accrual status.  
  American Capital Non-Performing Loans  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , American Capital loans on non-accrual status for 7 portfolio companies had a cost basis and fair value of   $192 million   and   $97 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , current loans, past due accruing loans and loans on non-accrual status were as follows (dollars in millions):  

Non-accruing loans at cost   increased     $7 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   primarily due to $72 million of loans placed on non-accrual status due to weaker portfolio company performance, $19 million of fundings on prior period unfunded commitments and $2 million of PIK allowance reversals, partially offset by $67 million of exits and write-offs and $4 million for reserves of accrued PIK interest. In addition, the cost basis of existing non-accrual loans decreased by $15 million. 
  During the third quarter of 2015, we recapitalized one portfolio company by exchanging a loan for common stock that had a cost basis and fair value of $3 million. 
  During the first quarter of 2015, we recapitalized one portfolio company by exchanging our loan for preferred equity securities that had a cost basis and fair value of $59 million.

European Capital Non-Performing Loans  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , European Capital loans on non-accrual status for 3 portfolio companies had a cost basis and fair value of   $83 million   and   $84 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , current loans, past due accruing loans and loans on non-accrual status were as follows (dollars in millions):  

Non-accruing loans at cost   decreased     $12 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   primarily due to $13 million of loans removed from non-accrual status due to improved portfolio company performance, partially offset by a $1 million increase due to foreign currency translation. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, European Capital recapitalized one portfolio company by exchanging loans for common and preferred equity securities that had a cost basis and fair value of $39 million and $41 million, respectively.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    
  All statements contained herein that are not historical facts including, but not limited to, statements regarding anticipated activity are forward looking in nature and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (i) changes in the economic conditions in which we operate negatively impacting our financial resources; (ii) certain of our competitors have greater financial resources than us, reducing the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or reducing the yield necessary to consummate the investment; (iii) there is uncertainty regarding the value of our privately-held securities that require our good faith estimate of fair value, and a change in estimate could affect our NAV; (iv) our investments in securities of privately-held companies may be illiquid, which could affect our ability to realize the investment; (v) our portfolio companies could default on their loans or provide no returns on our investments, which could affect our operating results; (vi) we use external financing to fund our business, which may not always be available; (vii) our ability to retain key management personnel; (viii) an economic downturn or recession could impair our portfolio companies and therefore harm our operating results; (ix) our borrowing arrangements impose certain restrictions; (x) changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and NOI; (xi) we cannot incur additional indebtedness unless immediately after a debt issuance we maintain an asset coverage of at least 200%, or equal to or greater than our asset coverage prior to such issuance, which may affect returns to our shareholder; (xii) our common stock price may be volatile; and (xiii) general business and economic conditions and other risk factors described in our reports filed from time to time with the SEC. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which statements are made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, as such, speak only as of the date made.    
   
           ITEM 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
     We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. 
  Interest Rate Risk    
  Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in NOI and net earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our NOI and net earnings.     As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our borrowings have been repaid in full. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately 14% of the principal balance of the debt investments in our portfolio were at fixed rates, approximately 62% were at variable rates with interest rate floors, primarily three-month LIBOR, 3% were at variable rates with no interest rate floors and 21% were on non-accrual status (4% of loans on non-accrual status were at variable rates). The three-month LIBOR rate was 0.9% as of   September 30, 2016  .    
  Based on our   September 30, 2016   consolidated balance sheets, the following table shows the annual impact on NOI and net earnings of base rate changes in the applicable interest rate indexes, primarily three-month LIBOR, (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments and excluding changes in the fair value of our investments and derivative instruments and loans on non-accrual status) assuming no changes in our investment, hedging and borrowing structure (in millions): 

Foreign Currency Risks 
  We have a number of investments in portfolio companies, primarily the European Capital investment portfolio, for which the investment is denominated in a foreign currency, primarily the Euro. We also have other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations, as reported in U.S. dollars. As of   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative translation adjustment, net of tax, recorded in our consolidated balance sheets was   $(95) million  , due to the translation of European Capital s balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   71 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk was estimated using a sensitivity analysis, which illustrates a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate as of   September 30, 2016  . As stated above, the Euro is the functional currency for the majority of our investments denominated in a foreign currency, and as such, the sensitivity analysis excludes any changes in other foreign currencies. Actual changes in foreign currency exchange rates may differ from this hypothetical change. Based on a hypothetical increase or decrease of 5% in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, assuming no hedging, the fair value of our investments would have increased or decreased by approximately $24 million. 
  Portfolio Valuation 
  Our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  . Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, such estimates of fair value controls may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of   82%   of our investments were estimated using Level 3 inputs determined in good faith by our Board of Directors because there was no active market for such investments.  
   
           ITEM 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  as promulgated under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
  American Capital, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  
  There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the third quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     On or about August 18, 2016, four shareholders of American Capital filed a consolidated putative shareholder class action allegedly on behalf of holders of the common stock of American Capital against the members of American Capital's Board of Directors in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland due to the directors  actions in approving the proposed merger between Ares Capital and American Capital. This action is a consolidation of putative shareholder complaints filed against the directors of American Capital on June 24, 2016, July 12, 2016, July 21, 2016 and July 27, 2016. The action alleges that the directors failed to adequately discharge their fiduciary duties to the public shareholders of American Capital by hastily commencing a sales process due to the Board's manipulation by a major shareholder, Elliott Management Corp. (together with its affiliates,  Elliott Management ). The complaint also alleges that the directors then failed to obtain for the shareholders the highest value available in the marketplace for their shares. The complaint further alleges that the proposed merger was the product of a flawed sales process due to Elliott Management's continued manipulation of the directors, the use of deal protection devices in the proposed merger with Ares Capital that precluded other bidders from making a higher offer to American Capital, and the directors  conflicts of interest due to special benefits, including the full vesting of American Capital stock options and incentive awards, or golden parachutes the directors are due to receive upon consummation of the proposed merger. Additionally, the complaint alleges that Ares Capital's Registration Statement on Form N-14, which was filed with the SEC on July 20, 2016 and includes a joint proxy statement to American Capital's shareholders, is materially false and misleading because it omits material information concerning the financial and procedural fairness of the proposed merger. The complaint seeks to enjoin the proposed merger between Ares Capital and American Capital. In the event that the proposed merger between Ares Capital and American Capital is completed, the complaint seeks to recover compensatory damages for all losses resulting from the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. On or about August 26, 2016, the American Capital directors named as defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs  consolidated amended class action complaint and moved for a protective order staying all discovery, pending the resolution of the motion to dismiss. On or about September 13, 2016, plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for limited expedited discovery and an opposition to the American Capital directors  motion to dismiss and motion to stay discovery. On or about September 21, 2016, the American Capital directors filed an opposition to plaintiffs  motion for limited expedited discovery and a reply in support of their motion to dismiss. On or about September 23, 2016, the Court held a hearing on the pending motions after which it announced a summary of its rulings denying the American Capital directors  motion to dismiss and motion to stay discovery and granting plaintiffs  motion for limited expedited discovery. On October 6, 2016, the Court issued a memorandum and order implementing its rulings. American Capital believes that these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

Item   1A. 
    Risk Factors    
     You should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including our interim financial statements and the related notes thereto before making a decision to purchase our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or not presently deemed material by us, may also impair our operations and performance. 
  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are not the only risks facing our Company. 
  Risks Related to Our Business and Structure 
  Future adverse market and economic conditions could cause harm to our operating results 
  Past recessions have had a significant negative impact on the operating performance and fair value of our portfolio investments. We have experienced losses during those recessions. Many of our portfolio companies could be adversely impacted again by any future economic downturn or recession and may be unable to repay our debt investments, may be unable to be sold at a price that would allow us to recover our investments, or may be unable to operate during such recession. Such portfolio company performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the referendum vote in June 2016 by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (commonly referred to as  Brexit ) has led to further disruption and instability in the global markets. There can be no assurance these market conditions will not continue or worsen in the future. 
  We may be dependent on the availability of debt financing to support our operations and growth. Any future indebtedness would increase our exposure, which would likely limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business 
  Our ability to continue to operate as a standalone business will be dependent on our ability to raise additional financing. To the extent that this consists of debt, it will increase our liabilities, require additional cash flow to service such debt and will most likely contain restrictive covenants limiting our financial and operational flexibility. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms, or otherwise, we may not be able to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to meet our business objectives, our share price may fall and investors may lose some or all of their investment. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, or if our outstanding options or warrants are exercised, the percentage ownership of our then stockholders will be reduced. 
  Risks Relating to Merger with Ares Capital 
  On May 23, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Ares Capital and certain other parties as set forth in the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which: (1) Orion Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Capital, will merge with and into us, with American Capital being the surviving entity in such merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Capital, (which we refer to as the  Merger ) and (2) ACAM will merge with and into Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital ( IHAM ) with IHAM being the surviving entity in such merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ares Capital, (which we refer to as the  ACAM Merger  and, together with the Merger, the  Mergers ). Immediately thereafter, we plan to convert into a Delaware limited liability company and withdraw our election as a business development company as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ( 1940 Act ). The Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are collectively referred to as the  Transactions.  
  We may fail to complete the Transactions 
  While there can be no assurances as to the exact timing, or that the Transactions will be completed at all, we expect to complete the Transactions as early as the fourth quarter of 2016. The completion of the Transactions is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, our stockholder approval, Ares Capital stockholder approval, required regulatory approvals, receipt of certain third-party consents and other customary closing conditions. We intend to complete the Transactions as soon as possible; however, we cannot assure stockholders that the conditions required to complete the Transactions will be satisfied or waived on the anticipated schedule, or at all. 
  If the Transactions are not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we or Ares Capital may be required to pay each other a termination fee of $140 million.

     Table of Contents  

Our board of directors considered the results of negotiations with Elliott Associates, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ( Elliott ), Elliott International, L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership ( Elliott International ) and Elliott International Capital Advisors Inc., a Delaware corporation ( EICA  and together with Elliott and Elliott International, the  Elliott Parties ). If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, our board of directors will be reconstituted pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement between us and the Elliott Parties, which includes, among other terms, (1) setting the size of our board of directors at ten directors and (2) appointing one director selected by the Elliott Parties and three additional independent directors to be mutually agreed upon by us and the Elliott Parties to replace four of our incumbent board of directors. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, the terms of the settlement agreement require our board of directors to establish a new strategic review committee to conduct a strategic review of our business and make recommendations to our board of directors regarding business strategy. If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, both the new strategic review committee and the changes in the composition of our board of directors could materially affect our business strategy.  
  Litigation filed against us and our board of directors and certain parties to the Merger Agreement, could prevent or delay the completion of the Mergers or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Mergers 
  We are aware that four lawsuits have been filed by our stockholders challenging the Mergers. Each of these suits is filed as a stockholder class action. These actions assert claims against the members of our board of directors and us alleging that the Merger Agreement is the product of a flawed sales process and that our directors breached their fiduciary duties by facilitating the acquisition of American Capital by Ares Capital for inadequate consideration and agreeing to lock up the Transaction with deal protection devices that preclude other bidders from making a successful competing offer for American Capital. The lawsuits also claim that American Capital, ACAM, ACMM, AGNC, Ares Capital and certain affiliates of Ares Capital aided and abetted our directors' alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The lawsuits demand, among other things, a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the Mergers and rescinding the transaction or any part thereof that may be implemented. These legal proceedings could delay or prevent the Transactions from becoming effective within the agreed upon timeframe or at all, and, if the Mergers are completed, may be material to the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the combined company. It is possible that third parties could try to seek to impose liability against the combined company in connection with this matter or other potential legal proceedings. 
  If the Transactions do not close, we will not benefit from the expenses incurred in its pursuit 
  The Transactions may not be completed. If the Transactions are not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. We have incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Transactions for investment banking, legal and accounting fees and financial printing and other related charges, much of which will be incurred even if the Transactions are not completed. 
  Termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us 
  If the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences, including: 
             
    our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Transactions, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Transactions;  
                
    the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the market price prior to termination reflects a market assumption that the Transactions will be completed;  
                
    we may not be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price Ares Capital has agreed to pay in the Transactions; and  
                
    the payment of any termination fee or reverse termination fee or reimbursement of the counterparties' fees and expenses, if required under the circumstances, could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. 
     Under certain circumstances, we and Ares Capital are obligated to pay each other a termination fee upon termination of the Merger Agreement 
  No assurance can be given that the Transactions will be completed. The Merger Agreement provides for the payment by us to Ares Capital of a termination fee of $140 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Ares Capital under certain circumstances. If our stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger Agreement is terminated, we will be required to reimburse Ares Capital for its expenses up to $15 million, which amount will reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any termination fee that becomes payable by us to Ares Capital. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides for a payment by Ares Capital to us of a reverse termination fee of $140 million under certain other circumstances. If the issuance of the shares of Ares Capital common stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement (including, if applicable, at a price below its then current net asset value per share) does not receive required stockholder and other 1940 Act approvals, if any, and the Merger Agreement is terminated, Ares Capital will be required to reimburse us for our expenses up to $15 million, which amount will reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any termination fee that becomes payable by Ares Capital to us.

     Table of Contents  

The Merger Agreement limits each of our and Ares Capital's ability to pursue alternatives to the Transactions; however, in specified circumstances, we or Ares Capital may terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal 
  Under the Merger Agreement, we and Ares Capital have agreed not to (1) take certain actions to solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions or (2) subject to certain exceptions, including the receipt of a  superior proposal  (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), enter into discussions or an agreement concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any proposals for alternative transactions. However, in specified circumstances, we or Ares Capital may terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a  superior proposal  prior to obtaining approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or the issuance of the shares of Ares Capital common stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement (including, if applicable, at a price that is below its then current net asset value per share), as applicable, from its stockholders, and we or Ares Capital, as applicable, could be required to pay to the other party a termination fee of $140 million.  
  Under certain circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, we could be required to pay to Ares Capital a termination fee of $140 million or Ares Capital could be required to pay to us a reverse termination fee of $140 million. These provisions, which are typical for transactions of this type, might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such an acquisition even if such potential competing acquiror were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share market price than the price per share market price to be paid by Ares Capital pursuant to the Merger Agreement or might result in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. 
  The Transactions are subject to closing conditions, including certain stockholder approvals that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the Transactions not being completed, which may result in material adverse consequences to our business and operations 
  The Transactions are subject to closing conditions, including certain approvals of our and Ares Capital's respective stockholders that, if not satisfied, will prevent the Transactions from being completed. The closing condition that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement may not be waived under applicable law and must be satisfied for the Transactions to be completed. We currently expect that all of our directors and executive officers will vote their shares of our common stock in favor of the proposals presented at our annual meeting required to complete the Transactions. If our stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement and the Transactions are not completed, the resulting failure of the Transactions could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. 
  In addition to the required approvals of our and Ares Capital stockholders, the Transactions are subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. 
  We and Ares Capital may waive one or more conditions to the Transactions without resoliciting stockholder approval 
  Certain conditions to our and Ares Capital's obligations to complete the Transactions may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by agreement of us and Ares Capital. In the event that any such waiver does not require resolicitation of stockholders, the parties to the Merger Agreement will have the discretion to complete the Transactions without seeking further stockholder approval. The conditions requiring the approval of our and Ares Capital's stockholders, however, cannot be waived. 
  Certain persons related to us have interests in the Transactions that differ from the interests of our stockholders 
  Certain persons related to us have financial interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders. The members of our board of directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Transactions and in recommending to our stockholders that the Merger Agreement be adopted. 
  We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Transactions are pending 
  Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions may have an adverse effect on us and, consequently, on the combined company following completion of the Transactions. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel until the Transactions are completed and could cause those that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Transactions, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future following completion of the Transactions. If our key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain affiliated with the combined company following completion of the Transactions, the combined company's business following the completion of the Transactions could be harmed. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking actions that it might otherwise consider to be in our best interests. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Transactions.

In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and prior to the termination, we lose key personnel, our business could be harmed.

Exhibit 31.1  
    
  CERTIFICATION  
    
  I, Malon Wilkus, certify that:  
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of American Capital, Ltd.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors: 
       
           (a)
