Note 1   Introduction and Basis of Presentation 
  Certain acronyms and terms used throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are specific to our company, commonly used in our industry, or are otherwise frequently used throughout our document.  Definitions for these acronyms and terms are provided in the "Glossary of Terms," available in the front of this document. 
  Description of Business 
  Swift is a transportation solutions provider, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's fleet of revenue equipment included   19,157   tractors (comprised of   14,380   company tractors and   4,777   owner-operator tractors),   62,727   trailers, and   9,131   intermodal containers.  The Company s   four   reportable segments are Truckload, Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, and Intermodal.   
  Seasonality 
  In the truckload industry, results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern.  As customers ramp up for the year-end holiday season, the late third quarter and fourth quarter have historically been the Company's strongest volume periods.  As customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, the first quarter has historically been a lower-volume quarter than the other three quarters.  In recent years, the macro consumer buying patterns combined with shippers  supply chain management, which historically contributed to the fourth quarter "peak" season, continued to evolve.  As a result, the Company's fourth quarter 2015, 2014, and 2013 volumes were more evenly distributed throughout the quarter, rather than peaking early in the quarter.  In the eastern and mid-western United States, and to a lesser extent in the western United States, the Company's equipment utilization typically declines and operating expenses generally increase during the winter season.  This tends to be attributed to declines in fuel efficiency from engine idling and increases in accident frequency, claims, and equipment repairs from severe weather.  The Company's revenue is directly related to shippers' available working days.  As such, curtailed operations and vacation shutdowns around the holidays may affect the Company's revenue.  From time to time, the Company also suffers short-term impacts from severe weather and similar events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions that could add volatility to, or harm, the Company's results of operations.    
  Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Swift Transportation Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  In management's opinion, these consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the periods presented.   
  Change in Accounting Estimate 
  In August 2016,   the Company decreased the estimated residual values of a certain group of its tractors, given recent trends in the used tractor market.  Management prospectively accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate.  This increased "Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment" in the consolidated income statements   by approximately   $3.6 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which immaterially affected basic and diluted earnings per share. 
  Change in Presentation 
  In April 2015, FASB issued   ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which amended ASC Subtopic 835-30,   Interest   Imputation of Interest.    The amendments in this ASU simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs and align the presentation with debt discounts.  Entities are required to present debt issuance costs within liabilities as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related debt, rather than as a deferred charge within assets.    In August 2015, FASB issued   ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update)  , which also amended ASC Subtopic 835-30,   Interest   Imputation of Interest  .  The SEC determined that ASU 2015-03 (discussed above) did not address costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.  The amendments in ASU 2015-15 clarify that entities may defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset, and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.    The amendments in these ASUs require   retrospective application, with related disclosures for a change in accounting principle.  For public business entities, the amendments in these ASUs are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and the interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   CONTINUED 
  The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2016.  Accordingly, DLCs, except for those associated with the Company s New Revolver, are presented as direct deductions from the face amount of the related debt.  The Company retrospectively adjusted the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to align with the current period presentation, as follows:

    2016-15:   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230)      Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
      
    This ASU has several amendments, which are designed to reduce existing diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues, of which the following are expected to be applicable to Swift: 1) debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, 2) proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, 3) proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, 4) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and 5) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.

    2016-13:   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses   (Topic 326)     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
      
    The purpose of this ASU is to amend the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.  This is the final credit accounting standard, out of a series, with detailed guidance on the new loss reserve model, Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL").  Among other provisions, the amendments in the ASU require a financial asset (or group of assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  Entities are no longer required to wait until a loss is probable to record it.

    2016-12:   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)     Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients 
      
    The amendments in this ASU clarify certain aspects regarding the collectibility criterion, sales taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications, and completed contracts at transition.  It additionally clarifies that retrospective application only requires disclosure of the accounting change effect on prior periods presented, not on the period of adoption.

    Impact of ASC Topic 606 overall is currently under evaluation; may be material, but not yet quantifiable.

Note 5   Accounts Receivable Securitization 
  On December 10, 2015, SRCII, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the 2015 RSA, which further amended the 2013 RSA. The parties to the 2015 RSA include SRCII as the seller, Swift Transportation Services, LLC as the servicer, the various conduit purchasers, the various related committed purchasers, the various purchaser agents, the various letters of credit participants, and PNC Bank, National Association as the issuing bank of letters of credit and as administrator.  Pursuant to the 2015 RSA, the Company's receivable originator subsidiaries sell, on a revolving basis, undivided interests in all of their eligible accounts receivable to SRCII. In turn, SRCII sells a variable percentage ownership interest in the eligible accounts receivable to the various purchasers.  The facility qualifies for treatment as a secured borrowing under ASC Topic 860,   Transfers and Servicing.    As such, outstanding amounts are classified as liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.  Refer to Note 15 for information regarding the fair value of the 2015 RSA.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , interest accrued on the aggregate principal balance at a rate of   1.1%   and   1.0%  , respectively.  Program fees and unused commitment fees are recorded in interest expense in the Company's consolidated income statements.  The Company incurred program fees of   $1.2 million   related to the 2015 RSA and   $0.8 million   related to the 2013 RSA, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  The Company incurred program fees of   $3.1 million   related to the 2015 RSA and   $2.7 million   related to the 2013 RSA, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  The 2015 RSA is subject to customary fees and contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, representations and warranties, and default and termination provisions.  Collections on the underlying receivables by the Company are held for the benefit of SRCII and the Purchasers in the facility and are unavailable to satisfy claims of the Company and its subsidiaries.  

Note 6   Debt and Financing 
  Other than the Company s accounts receivable securitization, as discussed in Note 5, and its outstanding capital lease obligations as discussed in Note 8, the Company's long-term debt consisted of the following:

Credit Agreement 
  On July 27, 2015, the Company entered into the 2015 Agreement, which replaced the 2014 Agreement, including the   $450.0 million   Old Revolver (  zero   outstanding at closing),   $500.0 million   Old Term Loan A (  $485.0 million   outstanding at closing), and   $400.0 million   Term Loan B (  $395.0 million   outstanding at closing).  The 2015 Agreement includes a New Revolver and a New Term Loan A.  Upon closing, the   $680.0 million   in proceeds from the New Term Loan A, a   $200.0 million   draw on the New Revolver, and   $4.9 million   cash on hand were used to pay off the then-outstanding balances of the Old Term Loan A and Term Loan B, including accrued interest and fees under the 2014 Agreement, as well as certain transactional fees associated with the 2015 Agreement. 
  The following table presents the key terms of the 2015 Agreement: 

____________ 
           (1) 
    The interest rate margin for the New Term Loan A and New Revolver is based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , interest accrued at   2.03%   on the New Term Loan A and   2.03%   on the New Revolver.  As of December 31, 2015, interest accrued at   2.12%   on the New Term Loan A and   2.08%   on the New Revolver. 
              (2) 
    The commitment fee for the unused portion of the New Revolver is based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio and ranges from   0.25%   to   0.35%  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , commitment fees on the unused portion of the New Revolver accrued at   0.25%   and outstanding letter of credit fees accrued at   1.50%  .  As of December 31, 2015, commitment fees on the unused portion of the New Revolver accrued at   0.25%   and outstanding letter of credit fees accrued at   1.75%  . 
              (3) 
    Commencing in March 2017, the minimum quarterly payment amount on the New Term Loan A is   $12.3 million  , at which it remains until final maturity. 
     The New Revolver and New Term Loan A of the 2015 Agreement contain certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.  The 2015 Agreement provides flexibility regarding the use of proceeds from asset sales, payment of dividends, stock repurchases, and equipment financing.  In addition to the financial covenants, the 2015 Agreement includes customary events of default, including a change in control default and certain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions, subject to certain exceptions, on incremental indebtedness, asset sales, certain restricted payments (including dividends and stock repurchases), certain incremental investments or advances, transactions with affiliates, engagement in additional business activities, and prepayment of certain other indebtedness. 
  Borrowings under the 2015 Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and are guaranteed by Swift Transportation Company, IEL,   Central Refrigerated Transportation, LLC   and its subsidiaries, Swift Transportation Co., LLC and its domestic subsidiaries (other than its captive insurance subsidiaries, driver academy subsidiary, and its bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary). 
  Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
  The Company incurred   no   losses on debt extinguishment during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred   $9.6 million   in losses on debt extinguishment  reflecting the write-off of the unamortized OID and deferred financing fees related to the 2014 Agreement, which was replaced by the 2015 Agreement.

Note 7   Deferred Loan Costs 
  As discussed in Note 1, DLCs related to the Company's New Term Loan A and accounts receivable securitization are now netted against the face amount of the debt, pursuant to the amendments in ASU 2015-03.  DLCs related to the New Revolver are reported in "Other assets."   The following table presents the classification of DLCs in the Company's consolidated balance sheets: 

Note 8   Leases 
  The Company finances a portion of its revenue equipment under capital and operating leases and certain terminals under operating leases. 
  Capital Leases (as Lessee)     The Company s capital leases are typically structured with balloon payments at the end of the lease term equal to the residual value the Company is contracted to receive from certain equipment manufacturers upon sale or trade back to the manufacturers.  If the Company does not receive proceeds of the contracted residual value from the manufacturer, the Company is still obligated to make the balloon payment at the end of the lease term.  Certain leases contain renewal or fixed price purchase options.  The present value of obligations under capital leases is included under "Current portion of capital lease obligations" and "Capital lease obligations, less current portion" in the consolidated balance sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the leases were collateralized by revenue equipment with a cost of   $326.2 million   and accumulated amortization of   $91.5 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , the leases were collateralized by revenue equipment with a cost of   $357.8 million   and accumulated amortization of   $90.1 million  .  Amortization of the equipment under capital leases is included in "Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment" in the Company s consolidated income statements. 
  Operating Leases (as Lessee)     Rent expense related to operating leases was   $57.0 million   and   $59.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Rent expense related to operating leases was   $170.3 million   and   $180.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 

Note 9   Purchase Commitments 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's outstanding commitments to acquire revenue equipment were as follows:  
               
    thereafter:   none  . 
     The Company has the option to cancel tractor purchase orders with   60   to   90   days' notice prior to the scheduled production, although the notice period has lapsed for   35.1%   of the tractor commitments outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  These purchases are expected to be financed by the combination of operating leases, capital leases, debt, proceeds from sales of existing equipment, and cash flows from operations.     
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $0.3 million   in outstanding purchase commitments for non-revenue equipment and   no   purchase commitments for facilities.  Factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures.

Note 10   Contingencies and Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation primarily arising in the normal course of business.  The majority of these claims relate to workers' compensation, auto collision and liability, physical damage, and cargo damage.  The Company expenses legal fees as incurred and accrues for the uninsured portion of contingent losses from these and other pending claims when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Based on the knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, advice of outside counsel, management believes the resolution of claims and pending litigation, taking into account existing reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company s view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. 
  For certain cases described below, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss or range of loss because, among other reasons, (1) the proceedings are in various stages that do not allow for assessment; (2) damages have not been sought; (3) damages are unsupported and/or exaggerated; (4) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals; and/or (5) there are significant factual issues to be resolved.  For these cases, however, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. 
  Arizona Owner-operator Class Action Litigation 
  On   January 30, 2004  , a class action lawsuit was filed by   Leonel Garza   on behalf of himself and all similarly-situated persons against Swift Transportation: Garza v.   Swift Transportation Co., Inc  ., Case No. CV7-472 (the "Garza Complaint").  The putative class originally involved certain owner-operators who contracted with the Company under a 2001 Contractor Agreement that was in place for one year.  The putative class is   alleging that the Company should have reimbursed owner-operators for actual miles driven rather than the contracted and industry standard remuneration based upon dispatched miles.    The trial court denied the plaintiff s petition for class certification.  The plaintiff appealed and on August 6, 2008, the Arizona Court of Appeals issued an unpublished Memorandum Decision reversing the trial court s denial of class certification and remanding the case back to the trial court.  On November 14, 2008, the Company filed a petition for review to the Arizona Supreme Court regarding the issue of class certification as a consequence of the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration by the Court of Appeals. On March 17, 2009, the Arizona Supreme Court granted the Company s petition for review, and on July 31, 2009, the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Court of Appeals, opining that the Court of Appeals lacked automatic appellate jurisdiction to reverse the trial court s original denial of class certification and remanded the matter back to the trial court for further evaluation and determination.  Thereafter, the plaintiff renewed the motion for class certification and expanded it to include all persons who were employed by Swift as employee drivers or who contracted with Swift as owner-operators on or after January 30, 1998, in each case who were compensated by reference to miles driven.  On November 4, 2010, the Maricopa County trial court entered an order certifying a class of owner-operators and expanding the class to include employees.  Upon certification, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration, as well as filing numerous motions in the trial court urging dismissal on several other grounds including, but not limited to the lack of an employee as a class representative, and the named owner-operator class representative only contracted with the Company for a three-month period under a one-year contract that no longer exists.  In addition to these trial court motions, the Company also filed a petition for special action with the Arizona Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in certifying the class because the trial court relied upon the Court of Appeals ruling that was previously overturned by the Arizona Supreme Court.  On April 7, 2011, the Arizona Court of Appeals declined jurisdiction to hear this petition for special action and the Company filed a petition for review to the Arizona Supreme Court. On August 31, 2011, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to review the decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals.  In April 2012, the trial court issued the following rulings with respect to certain motions filed by Swift: (1) denied Swift s motion to compel arbitration; (2) denied Swift s request to decertify the class; (3) granted Swift s motion that there is no breach of contract; and (4) granted Swift s motion to limit class size based on statute of limitations.  On November 13, 2014, the court denied the plaintiff's motion to add new class representatives for the employee class and therefore the employee class remains without a plaintiff class representative.  On March 18, 2015, the court denied Swift's two motions for summary judgment (1) to dismiss any claims related to the employee class since there is no class representative; and (2) to dismiss the plaintiff's claim of breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing.  On July 14, 2015, the court granted Swift's motion to decertify the entire class.  On December 23, 2015, the plaintiff filed a petition for special action with the Arizona Court of Appeals.  On July 12, 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the lower court s order decertifying the class.  Swift filed a petition for review with the Arizona Supreme Court on August 12, 2016.  A decision regarding the petition for review is forthcoming.  The final disposition of this case and the impact of such disposition cannot be determined at this time. 
  Ninth Circuit Owner-operator Misclassification Class Action Litigation 
  On   December 22, 2009  , a class action lawsuit was filed against Swift Transportation and IEL:   Virginia VanDusen, John Doe 1, and Joseph Sheer  , individually and on behalf of all other similarly-situated persons v.   Swift Transportation Co., Inc., Interstate Equipment Leasing, Inc., Jerry Moyes, and Chad Killebrew  , Case No. 9-CIV-10376 filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Sheer Complaint").  The putative class involves   owner-operators alleging that Swift Transportation

     Table of Contents           Glossary of Terms

misclassified owner-operators as independent contractors in violation of the federal FLSA, and various New York and California state laws and that such owner-operators should be considered employees.  The lawsuit also raises certain related issues with respect to the lease agreements that certain owner-operators have entered into with IEL.    At present, in addition to the named plaintiffs, approximately   450   other current or former owner-operators have joined this lawsuit.  Upon Swift s motion, the matter was transferred from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to the United States District Court in Arizona.  On May 10, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion to conditionally certify an FLSA collective action and authorize notice to the potential class members.  On September 23, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Swift and IEL from collecting payments from plaintiffs who are in default under their lease agreements and related relief.  On September 30, 2010, the district court granted Swift s motion to compel arbitration and ordered that the class action be stayed, pending the outcome of arbitration.  The district court further denied the plaintiff s motion for preliminary injunction and motion for conditional class certification.  The district court also denied the plaintiff s request to arbitrate the matter as a class. 
  The plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals asking that the district court s September 30, 2010 order be vacated.  On July 27, 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiff s petition for writ of mandamus and thereafter the district court denied the plaintiff s motion for reconsideration and certified its September 30, 2010 order.  The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the district court s September 30, 2010 order to compel arbitration, alleging that the agreement to arbitrate is exempt from arbitration under Section 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") because the class of plaintiffs allegedly consists of employees exempt from arbitration agreements.  On November 6, 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, stating its prior published decision, "expressly held that a district court must determine whether an agreement for arbitration is exempt from arbitration under Section 1 of the FAA as a threshold matter."  As a consequence of this determination by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals being different from a decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on a similar issue, on February 4, 2014, the Company filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court to address whether the district court or arbitrator should determine whether the contract is an employment contract exempt from Section 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act.  On June 16, 2014, the United States Supreme Court denied the Company s petition for writ of certiorari. 
  The matter remains pending in the district court and dispositive motion briefing was completed on September 30, 2016.  The Company also filed a writ of mandamus and appeal from the district court's order that effectively denied the Company's motion to compel arbitration.  The Ninth Circuit held oral argument on November 16, 2015, and after further briefing, dismissed the appeal on July 26, 2016, finding that it lacked jurisdiction.  The Company has filed a motion for reconsideration of this decision. The Company intends to vigorously defend against any proceedings.  The final disposition of this case and the impact of such final disposition cannot be determined at this time. 
  California Wage, Meal, and Rest Driver Class Actions 
  On   March 22, 2010  , a class action lawsuit was filed by   John Burnell  , individually and on behalf of all other similarly-situated persons against   Swift Transportation  :   John Burnell   and all others similarly-situated v. Swift Transportation Co., Inc., filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino (the "Burnell Complaint").  On September 3, 2010, upon motion by Swift, the matter was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the "California Court"), Case No. EDCV10-809-VAP.  The putative class includes drivers who worked for Swift during the four years preceding the date of filing and   alleges that Swift failed to pay the California minimum wage, failed to provide proper meal and rest periods, and failed to timely pay wages upon separation from employment.    On April 9, 2013, the Company filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, requesting dismissal of the plaintiff's claims related to alleged meal and rest break violations under the California Labor Code alleging that such claims are preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act. 
  The issue of class certification must first be resolved before the California Court will address the merits of these cases, and the Company retains all of its defenses against liability and damages pending a determination of class certification.  Class certification briefing is now complete and a class certification hearing was scheduled for April 25, 2016.  The class certification hearing was held and argued as scheduled.  In May 2016, the District Court issued an order denying class certification.  The plaintiffs and petitioners sought leave from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to appeal the class decertification order.  On July 18, 2016, the court denied the plaintiffs' and petitioners' petition to appeal the decertification order.  Therefore, at the present time and based upon the current procedural nature of the case, the final disposition and impact to the Company cannot be determined. 
  On   April 5, 2012  , the Company was served with an additional class action complaint,   alleging facts similar to those as set forth in the Burnell Complaint:      James R. Rudsell  , on behalf of himself and all others similarly-situated v.   Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC and Swift Transportation Company  , in the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino (the "Rudsell Complaint").  On May 3, 2012, upon motion by Swift, the matter was removed to the California Court, Case No. EDCV12-00692-VAP.  The Rudsell Complaint was stayed on April 29, 2013, pending a resolution of the Burnell Complaint. 
  On   September 25, 2014  , a class action lawsuit was filed by   Lawrence Peck   on behalf of himself and all other similarly-situated persons against Swift Transportation: Peck v.   Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC   in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside (the "Peck Complaint").  The putative class, which includes current and former non-exempt employee truck drivers who performed services in California within the four-year statutory period,   alleges that Swift failed to pay for all hours worked (specifically

that pay-per-mile fails to compensate drivers for non-driving related services), failed to pay overtime, failed to properly reimburse work-related expenses, failed to timely pay wages, and failed to provide accurate wage statements.    On October 24, 2014, upon motion by Swift, the matter was removed to the California Court, Case No. 14-CV-02206-VAP.   The Peck Complaint was stayed on April 6, 2015, pending a resolution of the earlier filed cases.  On November 20, 2014, the plaintiff filed a Private Attorneys General Act class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside (the "Peck PAGA Complaint"). Upon motion by Swift, the Peck PAGA Complaint was stayed on March 19, 2015.  On May 24, 2016, after the Burnell Court failed to certify the petitioner s class, the plaintiff filed a motion to lift the stay regarding the Peck PAGA Complaint.  On June 22, 2016, the court lifted the stay.  The matter is in its initial stages and the parties are engaging in discovery.  
  On   February 27, 2015  ,   Sadashiv Mares   filed a complaint   alleging five Causes of Action arising under California state law on behalf of himself and a putative class   against   Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC   in the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda (the "Mares Complaint").  On July 13, 2015, upon motion by Swift, the matter was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 2:15-CV-03253-JSW.  Upon the parties' stipulation, on October 17, 2015, the case was transferred to the California Court, Case No. 2:15-CV-07920-VAP.  The Mares Complaint was stayed on February 24, 2016, pending a resolution of the earlier filed cases.  On October 11, 2016, the court granted a motion filed by the plaintiffs to lift the stay.  The matter is in its initial phases and is expected to move into discovery. 
  On or about   April 15, 2015  , a complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino:   Rafael McKinsty et al.   v.   Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC, et al.  , (the "McKinsty Complaint").  The McKinsty Complaint, a purported class action,   alleges violation of California rest break laws and is similar to the Burnell, Rudsell, Peck, and Mares Complaints.    On July 2, 2015, upon motion by Swift, the matter was removed to the California Court, Case No. 15-CV-1317-VAP.  The McKinsty Complaint was stayed on August 19, 2015, pending a resolution of the earlier filed cases.  
  On   October 15, 2015  , a class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside:    Thor Nilsen   v.   Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC   (the "Nilsen Complaint").   The Nilsen Complaint   alleges violations of California law similar to the Burnell, Rudsell, Peck, Mares, and McKinsty Complaints.    On December 9, 2015, upon motion by Swift, the matter was removed to the California Court, Case No. 15-CV-02504-VAP.  The Nilsen Complaint was stayed January 29, 2016, pending resolution of the earlier filed cases.

The matter is in its initial phases and is expected to move into discovery.  The Company retains all of its defenses against liability and damages.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against the merits of these claims and to challenge certification.

  Washington Overtime Class Actions 
  On   September 9, 2011  , a class action lawsuit was filed by   Troy Slack   and several other drivers on behalf of themselves, and all similarly-situated persons, against Swift Transportation:   Troy Slack, et al  . v.   Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC and Swift Transportation Corporation   in the State Court of Washington, Pierce County (the "Slack Complaint").  The Slack Complaint was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (the "Court") on October 12, 2011, case number 11-2-114380.  The putative class includes all current and former Washington state-based employee drivers during the three-year statutory period prior to the filing of the lawsuit, and through the present, and   alleges that they were not paid minimum wage and overtime in accordance with Washington state law and that they suffered unlawful deductions from wages.    On November 23, 2013, the court entered an order on the plaintiffs' motion to certify the class.  The court only certified the class as it pertains to "dedicated" drivers and did not certify any other class, including any class related to over-the-road drivers.  On September 2, 2015, new counsel was appointed for the plaintiffs and on November 16, 2015, new legal counsel was substituted for the Company.  As a result of the substitution of counsel for both parties, the court extended all existing dates by ten months.

Indiana Fair Credit Reporting Act Class Action Litigation 
  On   March 18, 2015  , a class action lawsuit was filed by   Melvin Banks  , individually and on behalf of all other similarly-situated persons against   Central Refrigerated Service, Inc.   in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, Case No. 2:15-CV-00105.

At this time, the size of the potential class is unknown. The Company s motion to have the case transferred from Indiana to the United States District Court for the District of Arizona has been granted.  The first phase of discovery, regarding potential for identifying and certifying a class of affected job applicants, has been completed.  The Company retains all of its defenses against liability and damages.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against the merits of these claims and to challenge certification.  The final disposition of this case, including the size of any affected class, and the impact of such final disposition of this case cannot be determined at this time. 
  Utah Collective and Individual Arbitration 
  On   June 1, 2012  ,   Gabriel Cilluffo, Kevin Shire, and Bryan Ratterree   filed a putative class and collective action lawsuit against   Central Refrigerated Service, Inc., Central Leasing, Inc., Jon Isaacson, and Jerry Moyes   (collectively referred to herein as the "Central Parties"), Case No. ED CV 12-00886 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  Through this action, the plaintiffs   alleged that the Central Parties misclassified owner-operator drivers as independent contractors and were therefore liable to these drivers for minimum wages and other employee benefits under the FLSA.  The complaint also alleged a federal forced labor claim under 18 U.S.C.   1589 and 1595, as well as fraud and other state-law claims.      
  Pursuant to the plaintiffs' owner-operator agreements, the district court issued an order compelling arbitration and directed that the plaintiffs' causes of action under the FLSA should proceed to collective arbitration, while their forced labor, fraud, and state law   claims would proceed as separate individual arbitrations.  A collective arbitration was subsequently initiated with the AAA.  Notice of the collective arbitration was sent to more than   3,000   owner-operators who worked for Central Refrigerated Service, Inc. and leased a vehicle from Central Leasing, Inc. on or after June 1, 2009.  On October 26, 2016 the arbitrator assigned to the case ruled that approximately   1,300   Central Refrigerated drivers involved in the collective arbitration have been misclassified as independent contractors and that they should have been compensated as employees. The ruling left open the question of what damages, if any, are payable to these drivers.  The arbitrator ruled that such damages could be assessed in a collective proceeding and declined to decertify the collective proceeding under the FLSA.  No trial date on the claimant's damages has been set by the arbitrator. 
  In addition to the collective arbitration that is pending before the AAA, the   three   named plaintiffs, along with approximately   325   other owner-operators, have initiated a series of individual, bilateral proceedings against the Central Parties with the AAA.  Discovery is commencing in these individual cases, which are pending before approximately   30   separate arbitrators.  Rather than proceed simultaneously in hundreds of separate arbitration proceedings, the parties have agreed to select a small number of arbitration cases that will be litigated and proceed to hearing.  The outcome in these sample cases-some of which will be selected by plaintiffs  counsel and some by the Company s attorneys-will not have a binding impact on the remaining cases, which will be stayed.  The parties anticipate that the outcome of these sample, or bellwether cases, may illustrate potential outcomes of the other bilateral arbitration cases and facilitate resolution.  Actual trial dates for these sample proceedings have not yet been finally set by the arbitrators, but trials in the limited number of bellwether-like cases are likely to occur in the second quarter of 2017. 
  Upon the acquisition of Central Refrigerated Service, Inc. by Swift Transportation Company (the "Company"), the plaintiffs in both the collective and individual actions were allowed to amend their complaints in June 2015 to include the Company as a defendant.  
  In June 2016, the parties engaged in mediation that ultimately did not result in a settlement of the matter, given the plaintiff's initial demand was   $69.0 million   and the Company's estimated potential liability was   $3.0 million  .  Based upon the information exchanged between the parties during the mediation, and in accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded an accrual of   $3.0 million   in the second quarter of 2016 for the estimated probable loss incurred.  Based on the October 2016 arbitration ruling, the Company recorded an additional accrual of   $22.0 million   as of September 30, 2016.  Our estimate of the probable loss on this matter is based on the requirements of GAAP and upon the currently available information.  The Company and the Central Parties dispute the arbitrator s rulings to date and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the plaintiff s claims in both the collective action and individual proceedings.   
  California Class and Collective Action for Pre-employment Physical Testing 
  On   October 6, 2014     Robin Anderson   filed a putative class and collective action against   Central Refrigerated Service, Inc.   Case No. 5:14-CV 02062 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the "Anderson Complaint").  In this action, the plaintiff   alleges that pre-employment tests of physical strength administered by a third party on behalf of Central Refrigerated Service, Inc. had an unlawfully discriminatory impact on female applicants and applicants over the age of 40.    The suit seeks damages under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination Act, and parallel California state law provisions, including the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.

Upon the acquisition of Central Refrigerated Service, Inc. by Swift Transportation Company, the plaintiff was allowed to amend her complaint in October 2015 to include   Swift Transportation Company   and   Workwell Systems, Inc.   as additional defendants.  Workwell Systems, Inc. is the company that provided the physical testing service used by Central Refrigerated Service, Inc.  The litigation is still at a very preliminary stage and no trial date has been set.   There is not currently any information available regarding the number of potential members of the putative class or collective actions. 
  Central Refrigerated Service, Inc. and Swift intend to vigorously defend against the merits of the plaintiff s claims and to oppose certification of any class of plaintiffs.  The final disposition of this case and the impact cannot be determined at this time. 
  Demand for Inspection of Books and Records 
  In February 2016, the Company received several shareholder demands, requesting to inspect the Company s books and records, pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  The demands relate to the shareholders  alleged investigation pertaining to whether the Board and Jerry Moyes have breached their fiduciary duties with respect to matters that have been publicly disclosed concerning the Company's securities trading policy, limitations on the pledging of Company stock on margin, and share repurchases.  The Company responded to the shareholders  requests.  In September 2016, the Company received an additional request for records related to Board members' status as independent directors.  Any future disposition or resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Environmental 
  The Company's tractors and trailers are involved in motor vehicle accidents, and experience damage, mechanical failures, and cargo issues as an incidental part of its normal course of operations.  From time to time, these matters result in the discharge of diesel fuel, motor oil, or other hazardous materials into the environment.  Depending on local regulations and who is determined to be at fault, the Company is sometimes responsible for the clean-up costs associated with these discharges.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's estimate for its total legal liability for all such clean-up and remediation costs was approximately   $0.4 million   in the aggregate for all current and prior year claims.

Note 14   Income Taxes 
  Effective Tax Rate     The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   30.0%  , which was lower than management's expectation of   36.5%  .  The difference was primarily due to Federal domestic production deductions realized as discrete items in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was   37.0%  , which was lower than management's expectation of   38.5%  , primarily due to certain Federal employment tax credits realized as discrete items. 
  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   31.9%  , which was lower than management's expectation of   36.5%  .  The difference was primarily due to a foreign subsidiary's income tax credits related to tolls paid, a domestic subsidiary's income tax credits for research and development, a reduction in the uncertain tax position reserve, and Federal domestic production deductions, all realized as discrete items.  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   38.1%  , which was lower than management's expectation of   38.5%  , primarily due to certain Federal employment tax credits realized as discrete items. 
  Interest and Penalties     Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were approximately   $0.4 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively.  The Company does not anticipate a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits during the next   twelve months  .  
  Tax Examinations     Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various state jurisdictions for tax years ranging from   2010   through   2015  .  At the completion of these examinations, management does not expect any adjustments that would have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate. Years subsequent to   2011   remain subject to examination.

In September 2013, the Company agreed to advance up to   $2.3 million  , pursuant to an unsecured promissory note, to an independent fleet contractor that transported freight on Swift's behalf.  In March 2015, management became aware that the independent contractor violated various covenants outlined in the unsecured promissory note, which created an event of default that made the principal and accrued interest immediately due and payable.  As a result of this event of default, as well as an overall decline in the independent contractor's financial condition, management re-evaluated the fair value of the unsecured promissory note.  At March 31, 2015, management determined that the remaining balance due from the independent contractor to the Company was not collectible, which resulted in a   $1.5 million   pre-tax adjustment that was recorded in "Non-cash impairments of non-operating assets" in the Company's consolidated income statement.    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet estimated at fair value that were measured on a nonrecurring basis. 

Note 16   Segments and Geography 
  Segment Information 
  The Company s   four   reportable operating segments are Truckload, Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, and Intermodal.  
  Truckload       The Truckload segment consists of one-way movements over irregular routes throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. This service utilizes both company and owner-operator tractors with dry van, flatbed, and other specialized trailing equipment.    
  Dedicated       Through the Dedicated segment, the Company devotes use of equipment to specific customers and offers tailored solutions under long-term contracts. This segment utilizes refrigerated, dry van, flatbed, and other specialized trailing equipment.    
  Swift Refrigerated       This segment primarily consists of shipments for customers that require temperature-controlled trailers.  These shipments include one-way movements over irregular routes, as well as dedicated truck operations.     
  Intermodal       The Intermodal segment includes revenue generated by moving freight over the rail in the Company's containers and other trailing equipment, combined with revenue for drayage to transport loads between the railheads and customer locations.    
  Non-reportable Segments       The non-reportable segments include the Company's logistics and freight brokerage services, as well as support services that its subsidiaries provide to customers and owner-operators, including repair and maintenance shop services, equipment leasing, and insurance.  Intangible amortization related to the 2007 Transactions, certain legal settlements and reserves, and certain other corporate expenses are also included in the non-reportable segments.    
  Intersegment Eliminations       Certain operating segments provide transportation and related services for other affiliates outside their reportable segment. Revenues for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing segment.  These rates are adjusted from time to time, based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenues and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results.

Executive Summary 

Company Overview     Swift is a multi-faceted transportation services company, operating one of the largest fleets of truckload equipment in North America from over 40 terminals near key freight centers and traffic lanes.  We principally operate in short- to medium-haul traffic lanes around our terminals and dedicated customer locations.  We concentrate on this length of haul because the majority of domestic truckload freight (as measured by revenue) moves in these lanes and our extensive terminal network affords us marketing, equipment control, supply chain, customer service, and driver retention advantages in local markets.  Since our average length of haul is relatively short, it helps reduce competition from railroads and trucking companies that lack a regional presence. 
  Our four reportable segments are Truckload, Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, and Intermodal.  Our extensive suite of service offerings (which includes line-haul services, dedicated customer contracts, temperature-controlled units, intermodal freight solutions, cross-border United States/Mexico and United States/Canada freight, flatbed hauling, freight brokerage and logistics, and others) provides our customers with the opportunity to "one-stop-shop" for their truckload transportation needs.  
  Revenue       We primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers, generally at a predetermined rate per mile.  We supplement this revenue by charging for fuel surcharges, stop-off pay, loading and unloading activities, tractor and trailer detention, and other ancillary services.  The main factors that affect our revenue from transporting freight are the rate per mile we receive from our customers and loaded miles.  The main factors that affect fuel surcharge revenue are the price of diesel fuel and the number of loaded miles.  Fuel surcharges are billed on a lagging basis, meaning that we typically bill customers in the current week based on a previous week's applicable index.  Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel.  In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. 
  Revenue in our non-reportable segments is generated by our non-asset-based freight brokerage and logistics management service, tractor leasing revenue from our financing subsidiaries, premium revenue from our captive insurance companies, and revenue from third parties serviced by our repair and maintenance shops. Main factors affecting revenue in our non-reportable segments are demand for brokerage and logistics services, as well as the number of equipment leases by our financing subsidiaries to the owner-operators we contract with and other third parties. 
  Expenses     Our most significant expenses vary with miles traveled and include fuel, driver-related expenses (such as wages and benefits), and services purchased from owner-operators and other transportation providers (such as railroads, drayage providers, and other trucking companies).  Maintenance and tire expenses, as well as the cost of insurance and claims generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety improvements, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors.  Our primary fixed costs are depreciation and lease expense for revenue equipment and terminals, interest expense, and non-driver compensation. 
  Compared to changes in rate per mile and loaded miles, changes in deadhead miles percentage generally have the largest proportionate effect on our profitability because we still bear all of the expenses for each deadhead mile, but do not earn any revenue to offset those expenses.  Changes in rate per mile have the next largest proportionate effect on profitability because incremental improvements in rate per mile are not offset by any additional expenses.  Changes in loaded miles generally have a smaller effect on profitability because variable expenses fluctuate with changes in miles. However, changes in mileage are affected by driver satisfaction and network efficiency, which indirectly affect expenses. 
  Recent Developments     The truckload freight environment in 2016 has been challenging.  Excess industry capacity, excess customer inventories, and depressed shipping demand have pressured volumes and pricing.  We implemented the following initiatives to help counter the effects of these external factors: 
             
    We downsized our core truckload fleet in an effort to improve asset utilization, and we continue to closely monitor and adjust our truckload fleet size to ensure proper utilization of our fleets. 
                
    We selectively increased our participation in the spot market to improve network balance and help offset the lack of available freight in certain markets.  Our sales team remains heavily focused on increasing freight levels with both new and existing customer contracts, with the goal of eventually reducing our spot market activity.  
                
    We implemented several cost control initiatives throughout the organization, which include streamlining processes, reducing headcount, postponing non-critical system implementations, and reducing expenses in various other manners.  
     On September 8, 2016, we announced that Jerry Moyes would retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer effective December 31, 2016.  Richard Stocking (previously our President and Chief Operating Officer) and Mr. Moyes will serve as Co-Chief Executive Officers, with Mr. Stocking assuming all duties and authority of the office of Chief Executive Officer, from September 8, 2016 through December 31, 2016.  Pursuant to the unanimous approval by the Board, Mr. Stocking will begin serving as our sole President and Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2017.  The Company has contracted with Mr. Moyes to serve as a consultant with the title "Founder and Chairman Emeritus" for the three-year period following his retirement date.  Additionally, Mr. Moyes will continue on as a member of the Board.

Financial Overview 

____________ 
           (1) 
    Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives, or superior, to GAAP financial measures.  However, management believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations.  Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures," below.

Results of Operations   Comparison Between the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015 
  The $12.3 million decrease in net income from   $36.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $24.0 million   for the same period in 2016, reflects the following: 
           (1) 
    $25.2 million   decrease in Revenue xFSR   This was driven by decreases in the Truckload, Non-reportable, Swift Refrigerated, and Intermodal segments, partially offset by an increase in Revenue xFSR in the Dedicated segment. 
               (3) 
    $12.6 million   decrease in fuel expense, primarily due to lower fuel prices. 
              (4) 
    $19.8 million   decrease in purchased transportation   This was attributed to lower logistics and intermodal freight volumes, resulting in a decrease in payments to rail and other third-party carriers.  Additionally, fuel reimbursements to owner-operators and other third parties decreased as a result of lower fuel prices and fewer miles driven by owner-operators. 
              (5) 
    $7.1 million   one-time expense pertaining to Jerry Moyes' retirement package during the three months ended September 30, 2016, included in "Salaries, wages, and employee benefits." 
              (6) 
    $11.0 million   increase in "Operating supplies and expenses," which was primarily due to a $22.0 million increase in legal reserves resulting from the receipt of unfavorable information regarding certain litigation within our Swift Refrigerated segment that was outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 
     The three months ended September 30, 2015 included a $5.1 million settlement of a class action lawsuit and related items. 
           (7) 
    $5.5 million   decrease in insurance and claims, predominantly associated with negative development incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
               (9) 
    $11.0 million   decrease in income tax expense.  The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was     30.0%  , which was lower than our expectation of   36.5%  .  The difference was primarily due to Federal domestic production deductions realized as discrete items in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
     The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was   37.0%  , which was lower than our expectation of   38.5%  , primarily due to certain Federal employment tax credits realized as discrete items.

Results of Operations   Comparison Between the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
  The $26.3 million decrease in net income from   $125.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $98.8 million   for the same period in 2016, reflects the following: 
           (1) 
    $13.7 million   decrease in Revenue xFSR   This was driven by decreases in the Truckload, Swift Refrigerated, and Intermodal segments, partially offset by an increase in the Dedicated segment. 
               (3) 
    $73.8 million   decrease in fuel expense, primarily due to lower fuel prices. 
              (4) 
    $52.4 million   decrease in purchased transportation   This was primarily attributed to reduced fuel reimbursements to owner-operators, as a result of lower fuel prices and fewer miles driven by owner-operators.  Additionally, lower intermodal freight volumes resulted in a decrease in payments to rail carriers, further contributing to the decrease in the expense. 
              (5) 
    $47.1 million   increase in salaries, wages, and employee benefits expense   This was due to the driver pay increase implemented in May 2015, an increase in total miles driven by company drivers in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, an increase in group health insurance expenses, and a $7.1 million one-time expense pertaining to Jerry Moyes' retirement package during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (6) 
    $3.1 million   increase in "Operating supplies and expenses," which was primarily due to a $22.0 million increase in legal reserves resulting from the receipt of unfavorable information regarding certain litigation within our Swift Refrigerated segment that was outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  The three months ended September 30, 2015 included a $5.1 million settlement of a class action lawsuit and related items.  The increase in legal reserves was partially offset by an $11.2 million decrease in equipment maintenance costs. 
               (8) 
    $30.6 million   decrease in income tax expense   The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was     31.9%  , which was lower than our expectation of   36.5%  .  The difference was primarily due to certain income tax credits in our foreign and domestic subsidiaries, a reduction in our uncertain tax position reserve, and Federal domestic production deductions, all realized as discrete items.   
     The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   38.1%  , which was lower than our expectation of   38.5%  , primarily due to certain Federal employment tax credits realized as discrete items.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
   
 The terms "Adjusted EPS," "Adjusted Operating Ratio," and "Adjusted EBITDA," as we define them, are not presented in accordance with GAAP.  These financial measures supplement our GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business.  We believe that using these measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because they remove the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance.  Management and the Board focus on Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Adjusted EBITDA as key measures of our performance, all of which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures and further discussed below.  We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance and compliance with debt covenants. 
  Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Adjusted EBITDA are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, cash flows from operating activities, operating margin, or other measures prescribed by GAAP.  There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.  Although we believe that they improve comparability in analyzing our period to period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry if those companies define these measures differently.  Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered measures of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business.  Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis. 
  Adjusted EPS       Our definition of the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EPS, starts with   (a)   income (loss) before income taxes, the most comparable GAAP measure.  We add the following items back to   (a)   to arrive at   (b)   adjusted income (loss) before income taxes:  
           (i) 
    amortization of the intangibles from the 2007 Transactions, 
              (ii) 
    non-cash impairments, 
              (iii) 
    other special non-cash items, 
              (iv) 
    excludable transaction costs, 
              (v) 
    mark-to-market adjustments on our interest rate swaps, recognized in the income statement, 
              (vi) 
    amortization of previous losses recorded in AOCI related to the interest rate swaps we terminated upon our IPO and refinancing transactions in December 2010, and 
              (vii) 
    severance expense, including cash and equity award impact, related to the departure of certain executive leadership. 
     We subtract income taxes, at the GAAP effective tax rate, from   (b)   to arrive at   (c)   adjusted earnings.  Adjusted EPS is equal to   (c)   divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
  We believe that excluding the impact of derivatives provides for more transparency and comparability since these transactions have historically been volatile.  Additionally, we believe that comparability of our performance is improved by excluding impairments that are unrelated to our core operations, as well as intangibles from the 2007 Transactions and other special items that are non-comparable in nature. 
  The following table is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for consolidated Adjusted EPS: 
  Note:   Since the numbers reflected in the table below are calculated on a per share basis, they may not foot due to rounding.

     Adjusted Operating Ratio     Our definition of the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating Ratio, starts with   (a)   operating expense and   (b)   operating revenue, which are GAAP financial measures.  We subtract the following items from   (a)   to arrive at   (c)   adjusted operating expense: 
           (i) 
    fuel surcharge revenue, 
              (ii) 
    amortization of the intangibles from the 2007 Transactions,  
              (iii) 
    non-cash operating impairment charges,  
              (iv) 
    other special non-cash items, 
              (v) 
    excludable transaction costs, and 
              (vi) 
    severance expense, including cash and equity award impact, related to the departure of certain executive leadership. 
     We then subtract fuel surcharge revenue from   (b)   to arrive at   (d)   Revenue xFSR.  Adjusted Operating Ratio is equal to   (c)   adjusted operating expense as a percentage of   (d)   Revenue xFSR.  
  We net fuel surcharge revenue against fuel expense in the calculation of our Adjusted Operating Ratio, thereby excluding fuel surcharge revenue from operating revenue in the denominator.  Because fuel surcharge revenue is so volatile, we believe excluding it provides for more transparency and comparability.  Additionally, we believe that comparability of our performance is improved by excluding operating impairment charges, non-comparable intangibles from the 2007 Transactions, and other special items. 
  The following table is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for consolidated Adjusted Operating Ratio:

Adjusted EBITDA       Our definition of the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA, starts with   (a)   net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure.  We add the following items back to   (a)   to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA:  
           (i) 
    depreciation and amortization, 
              (ii) 
    interest and derivative interest expense, including fees and charges associated with indebtedness, net of interest income, 
              (iii) 
    income taxes,

              (vi) 
    other special non-cash items, and 
              (vii) 
    excludable transaction costs. 
     We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure for estimating the cash generated by our operations that would be available to cover capital expenditures, taxes, interest, and other investments and that it enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance.  We use Adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance.  Our method of computing Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with that used in our debt covenants, specifically in our leverage ratio, and is also routinely reviewed by management for that purpose.   
  The following table is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: 

____________

Results of Operations   Segment Review 
   
 We operate four reportable segments: Truckload, Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, and Intermodal.  The descriptions of the operations of these reportable segments are described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
  Consolidating tables for operating revenue and operating income are as follows: 

Our chief operating decision makers monitor the GAAP results of our reportable segments, as supplemented by certain non-GAAP information.  Refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" above for more details.  Additionally, we use a number of primary indicators to monitor our revenue and expense performance and efficiency. 
  Weekly Revenue xFSR per Tractor (monitored monthly)     This is our primary measure of productivity for our Truckload, Dedicated, and Swift Refrigerated segments.  Weekly Revenue xFSR per tractor is affected by the following factors, which are typically monitored daily: 
             
    loaded miles (miles driven when hauling freight), 
                
    fleet size (because available loads are spread over available tractors),

    network balance (number of loads accepted, compared to available trucks, by market).  
     We strive to increase our revenue per tractor by improving freight rates with customers, hauling more loads with existing equipment, effectively moving freight, managing balance within our network, maintaining our tractors, recruiting and retaining company drivers, and attracting and maintaining contracts with owner-operators.

Deadhead Miles Percentage (monitored daily)     This is calculated by dividing the number of unpaid miles by the total number of miles driven.  We monitor deadhead miles percentage in Truckload and Swift Refrigerated, as we strive to reduce our number of deadhead miles within these segments.  By balancing our freight flows and planning consecutive loads with shorter distances between the drop-off and pick-up locations, we are able to reduce the percentage of deadhead miles driven to allow for more revenue-generating miles during our drivers  hours-of-service. This also enables us to reduce wage, fuel, and other costs associated with deadhead miles. 
  Average Operational Truck Count (monitored daily)     We use this measure for all of our reportable segments. It includes tractors driven by company drivers as well as owner-operator units.  This measure changes based on our ability to adjust our fleet size in response to changes in demand. 
  Load Count and Average Container Count (monitored daily)     Within Intermodal, we monitor load count and average container count.  These metrics allow us to measure our utilization of our container fleet. 
  Adjusted Operating Ratio (monitored monthly)     We consider this ratio an important measure of our operating profitability for each of our reportable segments.  We define and reconcile Adjusted Operating Ratio under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" above.  GAAP Operating Ratio is operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, or the inverse of operating margin, and produces an indication of operating efficiency.  It is widely used in our industry as an assessment of management s effectiveness in controlling all categories of operating expenses. 
  The following tables are GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for each reportable segment's Adjusted Operating Ratio:

Truckload Revenue     The decrease in operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , consisted of a $15.8 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lower fuel prices, and a   $20.3 million   decrease in Revenue xFSR.  The   4.1%   decrease in Revenue xFSR reflects the following: 
             
    2.3%   decrease in Revenue xFSR per loaded mile, and a 
                
    1.8%   decrease in total loaded miles. 
      The decrease in weekly Revenue xFSR per tractor of   0.9%   reflects the following: 
             
    2.3%   decrease in Revenue xFSR per loaded mile, noted above, partially offset by the 
                
    1.4% increase in loaded miles per tractor per week. 
     Truckload volumes and pricing continued to be challenged with excess industry capacity, excess customer inventories, and depressed shipping demand during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We continued our participation in the spot market to help offset the lack of available freight in certain markets.  This helped to balance our network, but had a negative impact on Revenue xFSR per loaded mile.  We continue to monitor our spot market activity and expect to reduce our participation in the coming months. 
  Truckload Operating Income       Operating income decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , which was primarily driven by the decrease in Revenue xFSR, discussed above.  Other factors that affected operating income are discussed within "Truckload Adjusted Operating Ratio," below. 
  Truckload Adjusted Operating Ratio     Adjusted Operating Ratio increased 140 basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily driven by the decrease in Revenue xFSR, discussed above.  In addition to the industry challenges associated with volumes and pricing that negatively affected Revenue xFSR, the continued soft used truck market contributed to an increase in depreciation expense (due to a change in the projected residual values of certain trucks) and a decrease in gain on disposals of property and equipment.  This was partially offset by decreases in operating supplies and expenses and equipment maintenance expense. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we continued to implement various measures to improve cost control and efficiency, including right-sizing the fleet to drive improvements in asset utilization, improving freight and equipment network balance (which reduced deadhead percentage), continuing to focus on driver safety and satisfaction, and other cost control initiatives.  
  Dedicated Segment 

Dedicated Revenue       The increase in operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , consisted of a $4.9 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lower fuel prices, more than offset by a   $19.2 million   increase in Revenue xFSR. The   8.9%   increase in Revenue xFSR reflects the following: 
             
    8.1%   increase in weekly Revenue xFSR per tractor from improved pricing and freight mix, and a  
                
    0.8%   increase in average operational truck count, which was the result of recently awarded growth opportunities with our existing Dedicated customer base.  We expect further truck count growth in this segment during the three months ended December 31, 2016, excluding seasonal surge support from the Truckload segment of approximately 20 to 30 trucks.

Dedicated Operating Income       Operating income increased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , which was primarily driven by the increase in Revenue xFSR, discussed above.  Other factors that affected operating income are discussed within "Dedicated Adjusted Operating Ratio," below. 
  Dedicated Adjusted Operating Ratio     Adjusted Operating Ratio decreased 470 basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .  This was primarily driven by the increase in Revenue xFSR, discussed above, as well as the segment's continued focus on improving pricing, freight mix, underperforming fleets, and cost control.  These improvements were partially offset by an increase in driver salaries and wages.  
  Swift Refrigerated Segment 

Swift Refrigerated Revenue     The decrease in operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , consisted of a $2.1 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lower fuel prices, and a   $5.9 million   decrease in Revenue xFSR.  The   7.3%   decrease in Revenue xFSR reflects the following: 
             
    4.1%   decrease in total loaded miles, and a 
                
    3.2% decrease in Revenue xFSR per loaded mile. 
     The refrigerated market remained challenging as shippers continued to take advantage of the spot market, leading to sustained pricing pressures. This, along with the cost structure inherent in operating a refrigerated business, unfavorably impacted the profitability of this segment.  In response to these market challenges, Swift Refrigerated continued to work on securing quality freight, improving asset utilization, and controlling costs.  These efforts contributed to an increase in weekly Revenue xFSR per tractor of   2.9%  , which was favorably impacted by a 6.5% increase in loaded miles per tractor per week and unfavorably impacted by the decrease in Revenue xFSR per loaded mile, noted above.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we continued refining our refrigerated network, allowing more efficient matching of trucks with freight.  As a result, deadhead percentage in this segment improved. 
  Swift Refrigerated Operating (Loss) Income     Swift Refrigerated recognized an operating loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to operating income for the same period in   2015  .  The unfavorable change was driven by the decrease in Revenue xFSR, discussed above, and the factors discussed within "Swift Refrigerated Adjusted Operating Ratio," below. 
  Swift Refrigerated Adjusted Operating Ratio       Adjusted Operating Ratio increased significantly from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily driven by a $22.0 million increase in legal reserves related to new, unfavorable information associated with certain litigation within this segment, as well as a decrease in Revenue xFSR.

Intermodal Revenue     The decrease in operating revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , consisted of a $3.6 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lower fuel prices, and a   $5.1 million   decrease in Revenue xFSR.  The   5.8%   decrease in Revenue xFSR includes the following: 
             
    7.0%   decrease in load count, partially offset by a 
                
    1.4% increase in Revenue xFSR per load. 
     Securing intermodal freight that met our internal pricing requirements continued to be a challenge during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The intermodal freight market initially showed signs of strengthening in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as our monthly COFC load volume deficit decreased in July and August 2016.  However, United States rail traffic declined in September 2016, which caused inconsistent load volumes, primarily within our interior markets.  This created container and freight imbalances and increased pricing pressures, as an increasing number of intermodal providers continued with their attempts to balance their networks and gain volume through aggressive pricing.  Our COFC load counts decreased by 4.4%, which closely mirrored load count reductions in the intermodal industry as a whole.  Our TOFC load counts significantly decreased since we stopped offering this service in March 2016. 
  Intermodal Operating Income       Operating income decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .  This was primarily driven by the factors discussed within "Intermodal Revenue," above, and "Intermodal Adjusted Operating Ratio," below. 
  Intermodal Adjusted Operating Ratio     Adjusted Operating Ratio increased 40 basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .  This was primarily driven by the decrease in Revenue xFSR, discussed above, partially offset by the favorable impacts from our initiatives to improve our cost infrastructure and operational efficiencies.

Non-reportable Segments Revenue       Operating revenue within our non-reportable segments decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .  This was primarily driven by the logistics business from a change in shipping patterns for two customers, as well as a decrease in revenue from services provided to owner-operators. 
  Non-reportable Segments Operating Loss     Operating loss increased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  .

The   3.8%   decrease in Revenue xFSR reflects the following: 
             
    5.5%   decrease in load count.  COFC loads decreased by 3.0%, while TOFC loads were progressively ramped down, as we strategically focused on our COFC service.  In March 2016, the TOFC service offering was completely eliminated, which we believe will allow for increased operational efficiencies going forward. 
                
    partially offset by a 1.7% increase in Revenue xFSR per load. 
     The intermodal market was challenging throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with freight imbalances and increased pricing pressures.  The Intermodal segment remained committed to its strategy of moving appropriately-priced freight, aligned with its network. 
  Intermodal Operating (Loss) Income       Intermodal incurred an operating loss of   $1.6 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to operating income of   $1.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .

Results of Operations   Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses 

Operating Expenses       The following tables present certain operating expenses from our consolidated income statements, including each operating expense as a percentage of operating revenue and as a percentage of Revenue xFSR.  Fuel surcharge revenue can be volatile and is primarily dependent upon the cost of fuel, rather than operational expenses that are unrelated to fuel.  Therefore, we believe that Revenue xFSR is a better measure for analyzing many of our expenses and operating metrics.   
  Consolidated Expenses   Comparison Between the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    

The increase in salaries, wages, and employee benefits was primarily due to Jerry Moyes' retirement package. In conjunction with the Company's September 8, 2016 announcement that Mr. Moyes would retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Moyes to memorialize the terms of his retirement.  The Company contracted with Mr. Moyes to serve as a non-employee consultant from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, during which time the Company will pay Mr. Moyes a monthly consulting fee of $0.2 million in cash.  Additionally, the Company modified the vesting terms and forfeiture conditions of Mr. Moyes' previously-granted equity awards.  As a result of the terms of the agreement, the Company incurred a one-time expense in September 2016 of $7.1 million, consisting of $6.8 million in accrued consulting fees and $0.3 million for the impact of the equity award modifications.  The amount is included in the non-reportable segments' income statement. 
  Additionally, driver wage expenses were higher in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, which was primarily due to higher driver pay rates and a 0.6% increase in total miles driven by company drivers.  This was partially offset by lower expenses associated with workers' compensation and employee benefits. 

The increase in operating supplies and expenses was primarily due to a $22.0 million increase in legal reserves resulting from the receipt of unfavorable information regarding certain litigation within our Swift Refrigerated segment that was outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 
  The three months ended September 30, 2015 included a $5.1 million settlement of a class action lawsuit and related items. 

Fuel prices were lower overall during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which had an average DOE index of   $2.38  , compared to the same period in 2015, which had an average DOE index of   $2.63  .  The decrease in fuel expense was the result of lower fuel prices, as well as improved fuel efficiency, partially offset by the increase in total miles driven by company drivers, noted above.

Purchased transportation expense includes payments made to owner-operators, rail partners, and other third parties that we use for intermodal drayage and other brokered business.  The decrease in the expense was attributed to lower logistics and intermodal freight volumes, resulting in a decrease in payments to rail and other third-party carriers.  Additionally, fuel reimbursements to owner-operators and other third parties decreased as a result of lower fuel prices and a 2.9% decrease in miles driven by owner-operators. 

Insurance and claims expense decreased from the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This was predominantly associated with the negative development incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our insurance and claims expense increased significantly due to adverse development within our then prior-year claims and the corresponding impact on our reserves. 

For analytical purposes only, we combine our rental expense with depreciation and amortization of property and equipment because the mix of our leased versus owned tractors varies from period to period.  The combined expense decreased due to a smaller tractor and trailer fleet, but this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation resulting from a reduction in the residual values of certain trucks. 

Gain on disposal of property and equipment is dependent upon the number of tractors and trailers that we have available for trade or sale during the period, execution of those sales, the type of equipment we are selling, and the used equipment market, among other things.  The decrease in gain on disposal of property and equipment was primarily driven by lower gain on disposals of tractors, due to a soft used truck market in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015.  This was partially offset by an increase in the volume of trailers sold.   
  We expect gain on disposals of property and equipment to remain soft (in the $3.0 million to $4.0 million range) in the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Other Expenses       The following table summarizes fluctuations in certain non-operating expenses, included in our consolidated income statements, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  

Interest Expense           Interest expense is comprised of debt interest expense, amortization of DLCs, and (with respect to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  ) OID.  The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by overall lower debt balances during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Loss on Debt Extinguishment       In July 2015, we replaced the 2014 Agreement with the 2015 Agreement, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $9.6 million, reflecting the write-off of the unamortized OID and DLCs fees related to the 2014 Agreement. 
  Income Tax Expense         The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was     30.0%  , which was lower than our expectation of   36.5%  .  The difference was primarily due to Federal domestic production deductions realized as discrete items in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company anticipates securing additional Federal domestic production deductions for other tax years during the three months ended December 31, 2016, but the exact amount is not yet known.  Due to ongoing income tax credits and deductions, we expect the 2017 quarterly GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.0% to 37.5%, before discrete items. 
  The effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was   37.0%  , which was lower than our expectation of   38.5%  , primarily due to certain Federal employment tax credits realized as discrete items. 
  Consolidated Expenses   Comparison Between the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    

The increase in salaries, wages, and employee benefits was primarily due to the driver wage increase implemented in May 2015, a 1.6% increase in total miles driven by company drivers in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, as well as an increase in group health insurance expenses.  Additionally, the Company incurred a $7.1 million one-time expense pertaining to Jerry Moyes' retirement package in September 2016, which is discussed  in more detail under "Consolidated Expenses   Comparison Between the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  ," above. 

The increase in operating supplies and expenses was primarily due to a $22.0 million increase in legal reserves resulting from the receipt of unfavorable information regarding certain litigation within our Swift Refrigerated segment that was outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  The three months ended September 30, 2015 included a $5.1 million settlement of a class action lawsuit and related items.  The increase in legal reserves was partially offset by an $11.2 million decrease in equipment maintenance costs.

Fuel prices were lower overall during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which had an average DOE index of   $2.25  , compared to the same period in 2015, which had an average DOE index of   $2.80  .  The decrease in our fuel expense was the result of lower fuel prices, as well as improved fuel efficiency, partially offset by the increase in total miles driven by company drivers, noted above. 

The decrease in the expense was attributed to reduced fuel reimbursements to owner-operators, as a result of lower fuel prices and a 3.4% decrease in miles driven by owner-operators.  Additionally, lower intermodal freight volumes resulted in a decrease in payments to rail carriers, further contributing to the decrease in the expense.  This was partially offset by the impact of increasing owner-operator contracted pay rates in May 2015. 

Although insurance and claims expense slightly increased from the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of Revenue xFSR. 

Combined rental expense and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment slightly increased (partially due to a change in the projected residual values of certain trucks), but remained relatively flat as a percentage of Revenue xFSR.

At the end of 2015, we had a significant backlog of tractors that we were processing for trade or sale. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we worked through a majority of the backlog; however, due to the soft used truck market throughout the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , gain on disposals of tractors was lower than in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This was partially offset by an increase in the volume of trailers sold in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Other Expenses       The following table summarizes fluctuations in certain non-operating expenses, included in our consolidated income statements, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  

Interest Expense           Interest expense is comprised of debt interest expense, amortization of DLCs, and (with respect to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ) OID.  The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by overall lower debt balances during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as well as more favorable interest rates and terms in the 2015 Agreement, which replaced the 2014 Agreement in July 2015. 
  Derivative Interest Expense       Derivative interest expense reflects losses reclassified from AOCI into net income from the effective portion of cash flow hedges, as well as the income effect of mark-to-market adjustments and current settlements of interest rate swaps, which were de-designated in February 2013.  The final settlement of our interest rate swaps occurred in July 2015. 
  Loss on Debt Extinguishment       In July 2015, we replaced the 2014 Agreement with the 2015 Agreement, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $9.6 million, reflecting the write-off of the unamortized OID and DLCs related to the 2014 Agreement. 
  Non-cash Impairments of Non-operating Assets         In September 2013, the Company agreed to advance up to   $2.3 million  , pursuant to an unsecured promissory note, to an independent fleet contractor that transported freight on Swift's behalf.  In March 2015, management became aware that the independent contractor violated various covenants outlined in the unsecured promissory note, which created an event of default that made the principal and accrued interest immediately due and payable.  As a result of this event of default, as well as an overall decline in the independent contractor's financial condition, management re-evaluated the fair value of the unsecured promissory note.  At March 31, 2015, management determined that the remaining balance due from the independent contractor to the Company was not collectible, which resulted in a   $1.5 million   pre-tax adjustment that was recorded in "Non-cash impairments of non-operating assets" in the Company's consolidated income statements. 
  Legal Settlements and Reserves         In June 2016, we reserved for a $3.0 million expense from a legal matter, which was not associated with our normal business operations. 
  In June 2015, the Company settled a lawsuit related to a contractual dispute with an ancillary fuel system equipment supplier.  As a result of this settlement, the Company incurred a   $6.0 million   expense. 
  Income Tax Expense         The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was     31.9%  , which was lower than our expectation of   36.5%  .  The difference was primarily due to a foreign subsidiary's income tax credits related to tolls paid, a domestic subsidiary's income tax credits for research and development, a reduction in the uncertain tax position reserve, and Federal domestic production deductions, all realized as discrete items. 
  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   38.1%  , which was lower than our expectation of   38.5%  , primarily due to certain Federal employment tax credits realized as discrete items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 
  The following table presents our available sources of liquidity: 

____________ 
             (3) 
    Restricted cash and cash equivalents, and restricted short-term investments are primarily held by our captive insurance companies for claims payments. 
     Uses of Liquidity 
  Our business requires substantial amounts of cash for operating activities, including salaries and wages paid to our employees, contract payments to owner-operators, insurance and claims payments, tax payments, and others.  We also use large amounts of cash and credit for the following activities:  
             
    Capital Expenditures       When justified by customer demand, as well as our liquidity and our ability to generate acceptable returns, we make substantial cash capital expenditures to maintain a modern company tractor fleet, refresh our trailer fleet, and fund growth in our revenue equipment fleet.  We expect net cash capital expenditures to be in the range of $125.0 to $135.0 million for full-year 2016.  In addition to this, we expect to continue to obtain a portion of our equipment under operating and capital leases.  We believe we have ample flexibility with our trade cycle and purchase agreements to alter our current plans if economic or other conditions warrant. 
     Over the long-term, we will continue to have significant capital requirements, which may require us to seek additional borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital.  The availability of financing or equity capital will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions.  If such additional borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital is not available at the time we need it, then we may need to borrow more under the revolving credit facility (if not then fully drawn), extend the maturity of then-outstanding debt, rely on alternative financing arrangements, or engage in asset sales.  
  There can be no assurance that we will be able to incur additional debt under our existing financial arrangements to satisfy our ongoing capital requirements.  However, we believe the combination of our expected cash flows, financing available through operating leases, which are not subject to debt incurrence baskets, the capital lease basket, available funds under the 2015 RSA, and availability under the New Revolver will be sufficient to fund our expected capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
             
    Principal and Interest Payments       As of   September 30, 2016  , we had material debt and capital lease obligations of   $1.2 billion  , which are discussed under "Material Debt Agreements," below.  A significant amount of our cash flows from operations are committed to minimum payments of principal and interest on our debt facilities and lease obligations.  Additionally, when our financial position allows, we periodically make voluntary prepayments on our outstanding debt balances.  
                
    Letters of Credit       Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 Agreement, our lenders may issue standby letters of credit on our behalf.  When we have letters of credit outstanding, it reduces the availability under the $600.0 million New Revolver.  Standby letters of credit are typically issued for the benefit of third-party insurance companies and state departments of insurance for the purpose of satisfying certain collateral requirements, primarily related to our automobile, workers' compensation, and general insurance liabilities.  Our outstanding letters of credit have historically been in the range of approximately $100.0 million to $150.0 million.

Share Repurchases       From time to time, and depending on free cash flow availability, debt levels, stock prices, general economic and market conditions, as well as Board approval, we may repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock.  In September 2015, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of its outstanding Class A common stock.  We finished our repurchases under this authorization in January 2016.  In February 2016, the Board authorized an additional $150.0 million in share repurchases, of which   $65.0 million   remained available as of   September 30, 2016  .  See further details regarding our share repurchases under Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1: Financial Information. 
     Working Capital 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a working capital surplus of   $231.7 million   and   $306.7 million  , respectively.  
  Material Debt Agreements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.2 billion   in material debt obligations at the following carrying values: 
       As of   December 31, 2015  , we had   $1.4 billion   in material debt obligations at the following carrying values: 
       Key terms and other details regarding our material debt agreements and capital leases are discussed in Notes 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1: Financial Information, in this Quarterly Report on Form          10-Q, incorporated by reference herein. 
  Capital and Operating Leases 
  In addition to our net cash capital expenditures, we enter into lease agreements to acquire revenue equipment, including tractors and trailers.  Our tractor and trailer lease acquisitions and terminations were as follows:

Cash Flow Analysis 
  The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  

The   $28.4 million   decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , consisted of:  
               Unfavorable Cash Flow Variance: 

(1) 
    $81.9 million   decrease in operating income, driven by the factors discussed in "Results of Operations   Segment Review" and "Results of Operations   Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses," above. 
                  Favorable Cash Flow Variances: 

(2) 
    $21.0 million   increase in net cash provided by operating activities related to changes in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities, primarily due to increases in accrued liabilities, partially offset by timing differences in payments to our vendors.  
               (4) 
    $10.3 million   decrease in income tax payments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015.  This was primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes over the comparable nine-month periods. 
              (5) 
    $7.8 million   net remaining favorable variance was related to various factors that had an immaterial impact on net cash provided by operating activities.

The   $153.5 million   decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , consisted of: 
               Favorable Cash Flow Variances: 

(1) 
    $119.6 million   decrease in capital expenditures due to the timing of lease financing versus cash capital expenditures.  Our primary focus in 2016 has been fleet utilization.  As such, we did not add net capacity within our truck count during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ; however, we did replace older revenue equipment with new equipment during this time.  These replacements were primarily funded using operating leases, as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , when our revenue equipment additions were funded using a mixture of operating leases, capital leases, and cash on hand. 
              (2) 
    $19.7 million   increase in proceeds from sale of property and equipment.  The volume of trailer sales increased over the comparable nine-month periods, which was the primary contributor to the total increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment. 
              (3) 
    $8.6 million   favorable change in restricted cash and cash equivalents.  Changes in the balance are driven by the amount and timing of future claims payments by our captive insurance companies.  The restricted cash and cash equivalents balance increased $4.2 million during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , when it increased $12.8 million. 
              (4) 
    $5.6 million   net remaining favorable variance was related to various factors that had an immaterial impact on net cash used in investing activities. 
                  Unfavorable Cash Flow Variances: 

There were no individually significant unfavorable variances in net cash used in investing activities between the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

Cash Flow Impact of the 2015 Agreement:    The 2015 Agreement includes a $600.0 million New Revolver and a $680.0 million New Term Loan A.  Upon closing in July 2015, the proceeds from the New Term Loan A, a $200.0 million draw on the New Revolver and $4.9 million cash on hand were used to pay off the then-outstanding balances of the Old Term Loan A ($485.0 million) and Term Loan B ($395.0 million), including accrued interest and fees under the 2014 Agreement, as well as certain transactional fees associated with the 2015 Agreement. 
  The   $110.0 million   increase in net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , consisted of: 
               Unfavorable Cash Flow Variances: 

(1) 
    $115.0 million   cash used during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to repurchase shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, pursuant to the Board-authorized share repurchase programs.  See further details regarding our share repurchases under Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1: Financial Information and "Uses of Liquidity   Share Repurchases," above. 
               (3) 
    $56.6 million   increase in repayments of long-term debt and capital leases.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repaid $75.5 million on the New Term Loan A, reflecting $55.6 million in prepayments for the remainder of 2016 through 2017, as well as $19.9 million in scheduled minimum principal payments.  Excluding the impact of the 2015 Agreement, we repaid $20.6 million in principal payments on our term loans during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The remaining variance was attributed to other debt and capital leases. 
              (4) 
    $4.4 million net remaining unfavorable variance was related to various factors that had an immaterial impact on net cash used in financing activities.

Contractual Obligations 
   
 Key terms and other details regarding Jerry Moyes' retirement package are included in Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1, which is incorporated by reference herein. "Liquidity and Capital Resources," above, and "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements," below include details on other changes in our contractual obligations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Aside from these items, there were no material changes to the contractual obligations table, which was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
               Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
   
 Operating Leases     As of   September 30, 2016  , we leased   8,308   tractors under operating leases, which includes   5,444   company tractors and   2,864   owner-operator tractors financed by the Company.  Operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment. In accordance with ASC Topic 840,   Leases  , property and equipment held under operating leases is not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. All expenses related to operating leases and related liabilities are reflected in our consolidated income statements under "Rental expense."  Rental expense was   $170.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with   $180.9 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Purchase Commitments     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's outstanding commitments to acquire revenue equipment were as follows:  
               
    thereafter:   none  . 
     The Company has the option to cancel tractor purchase orders with   60   to   90      days' notice prior to the scheduled production, although the notice period has lapsed for   35.1%   of the tractor commitments outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  These purchases are expected to be financed by the combination of operating leases, capital leases, debt, proceeds from sales of existing equipment, and cash flows from operations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $0.3 million   in outstanding purchase commitments for non-revenue equipment and   no   purchase commitments for facilities.  Factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures. 
               Seasonality 
   
 In the truckload industry, results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern.  As customers ramp up for the year-end holiday season, the late third quarter and fourth quarter have historically been the Company's strongest volume periods.  As customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, the first quarter has historically been a lower-volume quarter than the other three quarters.  In recent years, the macro consumer buying patterns combined with shippers  supply chain management, which historically contributed to the fourth quarter "peak" season, continued to evolve.  As a result, the Company's fourth quarter 2015, 2014, and 2013 volumes were more evenly distributed throughout the quarter, rather than peaking early in the quarter.  In the eastern and mid-western United States, and to a lesser extent in the western United States, the Company's equipment utilization typically declines and operating expenses generally increase during the winter season.  This tends to be attributed to declines in fuel efficiency from engine idling and increases in accident frequency, claims, and equipment repairs from severe weather.  The Company's revenue is directly related to shippers' available working days.  As such, curtailed operations and vacation shutdowns around the holidays may affect the Company's revenue.  From time to time, the Company also suffers short-term impacts from severe weather and similar events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions that could add volatility to, or harm, the Company's results of operations. 
               Inflation 
   
 Inflation can have an impact on our operating costs.  A prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates, fuel, equipment, wages, and other costs to increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates correspondingly increase.  However, the effect of inflation has been minor in recent years. 
               Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
   
 See Part I, Item 1: Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference, for the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as follows:

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We have exposure from variable interest rates, primarily related to our 2015 Agreement and 2015 RSA.  These variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short-term interest rates.  We primarily manage interest rate exposure through a mix of variable-rate debt (weighted average variable rate of   1.7%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ).  Assuming the current level of borrowings, a hypothetical one-percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by   $9.4 million  . 
  We have commodity exposure with respect to fuel used in company-owned tractors.  Increases in fuel prices would continue to raise our operating costs, even after applying fuel surcharge revenue.  Historically, we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges.  The weekly average diesel price per gallon in the United States, as reported by the DOE, decreased from an average of   $2.797   per gallon for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to an average of   $2.250   per gallon for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  We cannot predict the extent or speed of potential changes in fuel price levels in the future, the degree to which the lag effect of our fuel surcharge programs will impact us as a result of the timing and magnitude of such changes, or the extent to which effective fuel surcharges can be maintained and collected to offset such increases.  We generally have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our fuel price exposure in the past, but continue to evaluate this possibility. 
   
                 ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and determined that as of   September 30, 2016   our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Information about our legal proceedings is included in Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  , and is incorporated by reference herein. 
   
                 ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   should be carefully considered as these risk factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, future results and/or our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.  The risks described in our Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and/or our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. 
  The risk factor set forth below updates the risk factor in our Form 10-K under the same heading.   
  Mr. Moyes has loans and other obligations against which he and certain of his family members have pledged a portion of their Class B common stock, which may cause a conflict of interests between Mr. Moyes and our other stockholders, and adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. 
  Cactus II Pledging     In July 2011 and December 2011, Cactus Holding Company II, LLC ("Cactus II"), an entity controlled by Mr. Moyes, pledged 12,023,343 shares of Class B common stock on margin as collateral for loan arrangements entered into by Cactus II and relating to Mr. Moyes. In connection with these December 2011 transactions, Cactus II converted 6,553,253 of the 12,023,343 pledged shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During 2012, the Moyes Affiliates converted an additional 1,068,224 shares of Class B common stock to Class A common stock and sold 4,831,878 of these pledged Class A shares to a counter-party pursuant to a sale and repurchase agreement with a full recourse obligation to repurchase the securities at the same price on the fourth anniversary of sale.  This sale and repurchase agreement was replaced in May 2014 with a similar sale and repurchase agreement covering 6,761,400 shares. On May 18, 2016 the maturity of this agreement was extended to May 30, 2017. On May 18, 2016, 1,951,006 shares of Class A common stock and 5,054,978 shares of Class B common stock previously pledged on margin for collateral for loan arrangements were transferred to a new VPF agreement as described below. On July 20, 2016, Cactus Holding II pledged an incremental 1,863,140 shares as collateral for a new loan arrangement. As of August 2, 2016, the Moyes Affiliates had pledged on margin a total of 4,130,112 shares, of which 2,243,252 were Class B and 1,886,860 were Class A common stock. These pledged shares could cause Mr. Moyes  interest to conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and could result in the future sale of such shares. Such sales could adversely affect the trading price or otherwise disrupt the market for our Class A common stock. 
  M Capital II VPF     In addition to the shares that were allowed to be pledged on margin pursuant to our second amended and restated securities trading policy, on October 29, 2013, an affiliate of Mr. Moyes ("M Capital II") entered into a VPF contract with Citibank, N.A. that was intended to facilitate settlement of the 2010 METS, issued in 2010 by an unaffiliated trust concurrently with the Company s IPO, which was required to be settled with shares of the Company s Class A common stock, or cash, on December 31, 2013. This transaction effectively replaced the 2010 METS with the VPF contract and allowed the parties to the 2010 METS transaction to satisfy their obligations under the 2010 METS (as contemplated by their terms) without reducing the number of shares owned by these parties. The VPF transaction allowed Mr. Moyes and certain of his affiliates, through their ownership of M Capital II, to participate in future price appreciation of the Company s Common Stock within certain levels, and retain the voting power of the shares collateralized to secure the VPF contract. Under the VPF contract, M Capital II was obligated to deliver to Citibank a variable amount of stock or cash during two twenty trading day periods beginning on January 4, 2016, and July 5, 2016, respectively. 
  Amended M Capital II VPF and Cactus VPFs     On October 30, 2015, M Capital II and another Moyes Affiliate, Cactus Holding I, entered into the Amended M Capital II VPF and the Cactus VPF, respectively. The purposes of these two VPF contracts were to (i) extend the maturity date of M Capital II s then-existing VPF with Citibank N.A. (discussed above) and (ii) generate cash proceeds for the repayment of certain stock-secured obligations of Cactus Holding II, a Moyes Affiliate, and thereby effect the release of certain shares of Class B Common Stock pledged in connection with the same.

Cactus Holding I entered into the Cactus VPF contract in respect of 3,300,000 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock, which were pledged by Cactus Holding I as security for its obligations under the Cactus VPF contract. Under the Cactus VPF contract, Cactus Holding I is required to deliver to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGMI") a variable amount of stock or cash during a three trading day period at the maturity of the contract on November 21, 2016 through November 24, 2016 (later extended to November 25, 2016). In connection with the Cactus VPF contract, Cactus Holding I received $48.3 million from CGMI (including the $18.5 million noted in the paragraph below). 
  In connection with the Amended M Capital II VPF, M Capital II paid Citibank N.A $18.5 million. The source of these funds was a cash payment from CGMI in connection with the Cactus VPF Contract. Under the Amended M Capital II VPF contract, M Capital II is required to deliver to Citibank N.A. a variable amount of stock or cash during a three trading day period at the maturity of the contract on November 21, 2016 through November 24, 2016 (later extended to November 25, 2016). The number of shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock subject to the Amended M Capital VPF remains unchanged at 13,700,000.  
  On May 18, 2016, M Capital II terminated its VPF covering 12,294,016 shares of Class A Common Stock, and entered into a new VPF covering the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock. The new VPF requires M Capital II to deliver a variable amount of Class A Common Stock, up to a maximum of 12,294,016 shares, or an equivalent amount of cash, upon maturity dates occurring on May 26, 2017 through May 31, 2017. The new VPF is collateralized by 12,294,016 shares of Class B Common Stock.  
  On the same date, Cactus Holding I entered into a new VPF covering 7,005,984 shares of Class A Common Stock. The new VPF requires Cactus Holding I to deliver a variable amount of Class A Common Stock, up to a maximum of 7,005,984 shares, or an equivalent amount of cash, upon maturity dates occurring on May 26, 2017 through May 31, 2017. The new VPF is collateralized by an aggregate of 7,005,984 shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock which were previously pledged on margin.  
  The VPF contracts allow Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates to retain the same number of shares and voting percentage as they had prior to these VPF contracts. In addition, Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates are able to participate in any price appreciation of the Company s common stock within certain levels. 
  In connection with the VPF transactions described above, an aggregate of 34,348,994 shares of Class B Common Stock and 1,951,006 shares of Class A Common Stock are collateralized to secure M Capital II s and Cactus Holding I's respective obligations under the VPF transactions.  As these shares are not pledged to secure a loan on margin, they are not subject to the securities trading policy limitation discussed below.  Although M Capital II and Cactus Holding I, respectively, may settle their obligations under the VPF transactions in cash, any or all of the collateralized Class B Common Stock shares could be converted into Class A common stock and any of the collateralized shares delivered on such dates to settle such obligations. Such transfers of our common stock, or the perception that they may occur, may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock and may create conflicts of interest for Mr. Moyes.    
  Other Obligations     On April 20, 2016, Mr. Moyes entered into a settlement agreement with the National Hockey League ("NHL") relating to a previously disclosed lawsuit between the NHL and Mr. Moyes.  As part of the settlement agreement, certain of Mr. Moyes  adult children entered into a Non-Recourse Guaranty and Pledge Agreement with the NHL pursuant to which they guaranteed certain obligations of Mr. Moyes and certain Moyes Affiliates to the NHL.  The guarantor s obligations are collateralized by 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock owned by the guarantors.    
  Margin Pledging Limitations     The Company has a securities trading policy ("STP") that includes, among other things, limitations on the pledging of Company stock on margin.  As disclosed at the time of our IPO, under the STP, directors, senior executive officers (including the Chief Executive Officer) and compliance officers were not permitted to pledge more than 20% of their family stock holdings for margin loans. In July 2013, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board approved revisions to the STP to further limit pledging of stock on margin, under which, effective July 1, 2014, the limitation was reduced to 15% of family stock holdings and was scheduled to be reduced to 10% of family stock holdings as of July 1, 2015.  
  In June 2015, Mr. Moyes reported to the independent chairman of the Board that he was in compliance with the limitation on pledging stock on margin and was working to reduce the amount pledged on margin to below the 10% limit scheduled to take effect, but needed until November 2015 to do so in an orderly fashion. Following Board discussion of these circumstances, the Board amended the STP so that the 15% limit would remain in effect through November 30, 2015 and the 10% limit would take effect on December 1, 2015.  
  In October 2015, Mr. Moyes informed the Company that due to the drop in the stock price he had pledged additional shares of Company stock on margin in August and September 2015, in contravention of the STP, and that the percentage of family stock holdings pledged on margin was in excess of the 15% limit. He was precluded from selling shares during this time because he was in possession of material non-public information.  
  The independent members of the Board met and considered these events in light of competing concerns. On the one hand, the policy and limitations on pledging stock on margin were intended to avoid the risks of stock being sold to satisfy a margin call at a time when Company insiders might have material nonpublic information. On the other hand, unwinding margin positions in significant amounts in a short period could generate adverse market perceptions concerning the Company and the stock. In addition, the Board sought additional information regarding Mr. Moyes' plans to reduce the level of stock pledged on margin.

In response to these developments and the competing concerns identified, the Board directed Mr. Moyes to reduce the level of stock pledged on margin to 15% or less of family holdings no later than November 4, 2015 and determined to waive compliance with the 10% limit (but not the 15% limit) through December 31, 2016 so that the margin positions could be reduced in an orderly fashion. In addition, the Board formally reprimanded Mr. Moyes and imposed sanctions. 
  The Company's stock price volatility continued in December 2015 and necessitated Mr. Moyes to increase the level of Company stock pledged on margin; thereby exceeding the 15% limit. Taking into account various competing concerns, on December 18, 2015, the Board determined to waive compliance with the 15% limit (but not the 20% limit) through December 31, 2016 to allow Mr. Moyes to reduce the margin position in an orderly manner. 
  After giving effect to the amendments and waivers discussed above, the current STP provides that directors, senior executive officers (including the Chief Executive Officer) and compliance officers are not permitted to pledge more than 20% of their family stock holdings for margin loans through December 31, 2016, reducing to 15% of family stock holdings through December 31, 2017 and 10% of family stock holdings after January 1, 2018.
