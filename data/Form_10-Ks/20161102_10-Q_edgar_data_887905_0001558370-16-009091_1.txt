1.      Genera  l 

LTC Properties, Inc., a health care real estate investment trust (or REIT), was incorporated on May 12, 1992 in the State of Maryland and commenced operations on August 25, 1992. We invest primarily in seniors housing and health care properties primarily through sale-leaseback transactions, mortgage financing and structured finance solutions including mezzanine lending.      We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments, for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. Our primary objectives are to create, sustain and enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income for distribution to stockholders through real estate investments in seniors housing and health care properties managed by experienced operators. Our primary seniors housing and health care property classifications include skilled nursing centers (or SNF), assisted living communities (or ALF), independent living communities (or ILF), memory care communities (or MC) and combinations thereof. To meet these objectives, we attempt to invest in properties that provide opportunity for additional value and current returns to our stockholders and diversify our investment portfolio by geographic location, operator, property classification and form of investment. 

We have prepared consolidated financial statements included herein without audit and in the opinion of management have included all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (or GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to rules and regulations governing the presentation of interim financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation, including changes as a result of the application of accounting guidance for properties classified as held-for-sale.  

No provision has been made for federal or state income taxes. Our company qualifies as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As such, we generally are not taxed on income that is distributed to our stockholders.   

New Accounting Pronouncements. 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (or FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (or ASU) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which requires revenue to be based upon the consideration expected from customers for promised goods or services.  The new standard, effective on January 1, 2018, permits either the retrospective or cumulative effects transition method and allows for early adoption on January 1, 2017.  We expect to adopt this standard effective on January 1, 2018.  We do not believe this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  :    Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going

(Unaudited) 

Concern.   The amendments in this update define management s responsibility under GAAP to evaluate when and how substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern should be disclosed in the financial statement footnotes. This ASU expands disclosure requirements about principal conditions or events that raise substantial doubt. It also requires disclosing management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relationship to the organization s ability to meet its obligations, and management s plans that are intended to either alleviate substantial doubt or to mitigate conditions or events that raise substantial doubt. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or disclosures. 

In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02 (or ASU 2015-02),   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   ASU 2015-02 amends the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities and voting interest entities, among other items, by eliminating the consolidation model previously applied to limited partnerships, emphasizing the risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest and reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest. ASU 2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, for public companies. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (or ASU 2016-02),   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 modifies existing guidance for off-balance sheet treatment of a lessees  operating leases by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Under ASU 2016-02, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07 (or ASU 2016-07),   Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.   ASU 2016-07 eliminates retroactive adjustment of an investment upon an investment qualifying for the equity method of accounting and requires the equity method investor to adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 (or ASU 2016-09),   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09 addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (  a  ) income tax consequences; (  b  ) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (  c  ) classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, FASB issued authoritative guidance that reduces the diversity in practice of the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows for early adoption.

The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements is still being evaluated. 

2.      Real Estate Investments 

Assisted living communities, independent living communities, memory care communities and combinations thereof are included in the assisted living property classification (or collectively ALF). Range of care communities (or ROC) property classification consists of properties providing skilled nursing and any combination of assisted living, independent living and/or memory care services. 

Any reference to the number of properties, number of units, number of beds, and yield on investments in real estate are unaudited and outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm s review of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 

Owned Properties.   The following table summarizes our investments in owned properties at September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands)  : 

(1) 

We own properties in 28 states that are leased to 27 different operators.     

(2) 

Represents three development projects consisting of a 66-unit memory care community, a 108-unit independent living community and  a 143-bed skilled nursing center.     

(3) 

Includes three parcels of land held-for-use, and one behavioral health care hospital. The behavioral health care hospital has two licensed skilled nursing beds and 116 acute care hospital beds which represents an investment of $78.39 per bed.     

Owned properties are leased pursuant to non-cancelable operating leases generally with an initial term of 10 to 15 years. Each lease is a triple net lease which requires the lessee to pay all taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, capital and non-capital expenditures and other costs necessary in the operations of the facilities. Many of the leases contain renewal options. The leases provide for fixed minimum base rent during the initial and renewal periods. The majority of our leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year that are generally computed in one of four ways depending on specific provisions of each lease: 

(i) 

a specified percentage increase over the prior year s rent, generally between 2.0% and 3.0%;       

(ii) 

a calculation based on the Consumer Price Index;     

(iii) 

as a percentage of facility net patient revenues in excess of base amounts; or     

(iv) 

specific dollar increases.

Acquisitions and Development:   The following table summarizes our acquisitions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands)  : 

(1) 

Represents cost associated with our acquisitions; however, depending on the accounting treatment of our acquisitions, transaction costs may be capitalized to the properties  basis and, for our land purchases with forward development commitments, transaction costs are capitalized as part of construction in progress. Additionally, transaction costs may include costs related to the prior year due to timing and terminated transactions.      

(2) 

We acquired a newly constructed 126-bed skilled nursing center in Texas.      

(3)

The following table summarizes our investment in development and improvement projects for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands)  : 

The following table summarizes our completed projects during the nine months ended September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands): 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold a 48-unit assisted living community located in Florida for $1,750,000 which was previously written down to its estimated sale price in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, we sold two skilled nursing centers in Texas and an assisted living community in Florida for an aggregate price of $11,850,000. As a result of these sales, we recognized a net gain on sale of $3,775,000.  Also, we sold a school in New Jersey for $3,850,000 and recorded a net loss on sale in the amount of $193,000. 

Mortgage Loans.   The following table summarizes our investments in mortgage loans secured by first mortgages at September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands)  : 

(1) 

We have investments in properties located in seven states that include mortgages to 10 different operators.     

(2) 

Includes a parcel of land secured under a short-term mortgage loan.     

At September 30, 2016, the mortgage loans had interest rates ranging from 7.3% to 13.9% and maturities ranging from 2016 to 2045. In addition, some loans contain certain guarantees, provide for certain facility fees and generally have 20-year to 30-year amortization schedules. The majority of the mortgage loans provide for annual increases in the interest rate based upon a specified increase of 10 to 25 basis points.

The following table summarizes our mortgage loan activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 

Secured by skilled nursing centers     

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased and equipped a 106-bed skilled nursing center in Wisconsin for a total of $13,946,000 by exercising our purchase option under a $10,600,000 mortgage and construction loan.      

3.  Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  

We have made a preferred equity investment in an entity (or the JV) that owns four Arizona properties providing independent, assisted living and memory care services. At closing, we provided an initial preferred capital contribution of $20,143,000 and have committed to provide an additional preferred capital contribution of $5,507,000 for a total preferred capital contribution of $25,650,000. As the preferred member of the JV, we are entitled to receive a 15% preferred return, a portion of which is paid in cash and a portion of which is deferred if the cash flow of the JV is insufficient to pay all of the accrued preferred return. The unpaid accrued preferred return is accrued up to the common member s capital account balance in the underlying JV (as determined in accordance with GAAP).  We did not accrue the deferred portion of the preferred return during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We continue to evaluate our claim on the estimated net assets of the underlying joint venture quarterly. Any unpaid accrued preferred return, whether recorded or unrecorded by us, is due and payable upon redemption. 

The JV is intended to be self-financing and other than our preferred capital contributions, we are not required to provide any direct support and we are not entitled to share in the JV s earnings or losses. As a result, we believe our maximum exposure to loss related to our investment in the JV would be limited to our preferred capital contributions plus any unpaid accrued preferred return. We have concluded that the JV meets the accounting criteria to be considered a variable interest entity (or VIE). However, because we do not control the entity, nor do we have any role in the day-to-day management, we are not the primary beneficiary of the JV. Therefore, we account for our JV investment using the equity method. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we provided an additional preferred capital contribution of $481,000. Accordingly, we have a remaining preferred capital contribution commitment of $5,026,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $839,000 in income and received $1,409,000 of cash from our preferred equity investment in the JV.   

During 2015, we originated a $2,900,000 mezzanine loan to develop a 99-unit combination ALF, MC and ILF community. The loan matures on November 1, 2020 and bears interest at 10% for the first two years escalating to 12% until November 1, 2018 and, 15% thereafter. Interest is deferred for a period ending on the earlier of February 1, 2017 or the effective date of the certificate of occupancy. During this period, the borrower is not required to pay any interest; however, the unpaid deferred interest accrues to the loan principal balance. In addition to the interest payments, the borrower is required to make cash flow participation payments. We have evaluated this acquisition, development and construction (or ADC)

arrangement and determined that the characteristics are similar to a jointly-owned investment or partnership, and accordingly, the investment is accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting instead of loan accounting. 

4.      Notes Receivable 

Notes receivable consists of various loans and line of credit agreements. The following table summarizes our notes receivable activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (dollar amounts in thousands): 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we originated a $1,400,000 mezzanine loan funding $1,200,000 at closing with a commitment to fund an additional $200,000 upon achieving certain coverage ratios. The mezzanine loan is secured by a second mortgage on two skilled nursing centers located in Oregon totaling 146 beds. The mezzanine loan has a five year term and a rate of 15%. We have evaluated this ADC arrangement and determined that the characteristics are similar to a loan, and accordingly, the investment is recorded as a loan. 

At September 30, 2016, we had six loans and line of credit agreements with on-going commitments totaling $3,525,000. As of September 30, 2016, we have remaining commitments of $1,714,000 under these agreements. 

5.      Debt Obligations 

The following table sets forth information regarding debt obligations by component as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (  dollar amounts in thousands): 

Bank Borrowings.   We have an Unsecured Credit Agreement that provides for a revolving line of credit up to $600,000,000.  The Unsecured Credit Agreement matures on October 14, 2018 and provides for a one-year extension option at our discretion, subject to customary conditions. Based on our leverage at September 30, 2016, the facility provides for interest annually at LIBOR plus 150 basis points and an unused commitment fee of 35 basis points. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we borrowed $83,500,000 and $267,000,000, respectively, under our Unsecured Credit Agreement.

Additionally, we repaid $127,000,000 and $101,500,000, respectively, under our unsecured revolving line of credit.  At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants. 

Senior Unsecured Notes.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold $37,500,000 senior unsecured term notes to affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (or Prudential) with an annual fixed rate of 4.15%. The notes have an average 10-year life, scheduled principal payments and will mature in 2028. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $16,667,000 in regular scheduled principal payments to Prudential. Accordingly, we have $12,500,000 available under our shelf agreement with Prudential. Additionally, we amended our agreement with AIG Asset Management (U.S.) LLC (or AIG) which provides for the possible issuance of up to an additional $40,000,000 unsecured notes. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold $40,000,000 senior unsecured term notes under our amended agreement with AIG to affiliated insurance company investment advisory clients of AIG with a coupon of 3.99%. The notes have an average 10-year life, fixed interest rate and will mature in 2031. 

6.  Equity 

Equity activity was as follows   (in thousands)  : 

Preferred Stock.        We had 2,000,000 shares of our 8.5% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (or Series C preferred stock) outstanding. Our Series C preferred stock was convertible into 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at $19.25 per share and dividends were payable quarterly. During 2015, the sole holder of our Series C Preferred stock elected to convert all of its preferred shares into 2,000,000 shares of common stock. Accordingly, we had no preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 

Common Stock.   During 2015, we entered into equity distribution agreements (or Original Agreements) to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $200,000,000 in aggregate offering price of our common shares.

Available Shelf Registrations.     We had an automatic shelf registration statement which was filed in 2013 and provided us with the capacity to publicly offer up to $800,000,000 in common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt, depositary shares, or units. In advance of the three-year expiration of the automatic shelf registration statement we filed in 2013, we filed a new automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC on January 29, 2016 to provide us with additional capacity to publicly offer an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt, depositary shares, or units.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accumulated comprehensive income of $8,000 and $47,000, respectively, represents the net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale REMIC Certificates recorded in 2005 when we repurchased the loans in the underlying loan pool. This amount is being amortized to increase interest income over the remaining life of the loans that we repurchased from the REMIC Pool. 

Stock-Based Compensation  .  During 2015, we adopted and our shareholders approved the 2015 Equity Participation Plan (or the 2015 Plan) which replaces the 2008 Equity Participation Plan (or the 2008 Plan). Under the 2015 Plan, 1,400,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for awards, including nonqualified stock option grants and restricted stock grants to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The terms of the awards granted under the 2015 Plan are set by our compensation committee at its discretion.

We are a party from time to time to various general and professional liability claims and lawsuits asserted against the lessees or borrowers of our properties, which in our opinion are not singularly or in the aggregate material to our results of operations or financial condition. These types of claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability, which we believe under applicable legal principles are not our responsibility as a non-possessory landlord or mortgage holder. We believe that these matters are the responsibility of our lessees and borrowers pursuant to general legal principles and pursuant to insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases or mortgages. We intend to continue to vigorously defend such claims.

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. We do not invest our cash in auction rate securities. The carrying value and fair value of our financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 assuming election of fair value for our financial assets and financial liabilities were as follows (  in thousands  ): 

(1) 

Our investment in mortgage loans receivable is classified as Level 3. The fair value is determined using a widely accepted valuation technique, discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows. The discount rate is determined using our assumption on market conditions adjusted for market and credit risk and current returns on our investments. The discount rate used to value our future cash inflows of the mortgage loans receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 9.1% and 8.9%, respectively.     

(2) 

Our bank borrowings bear interest at a variable interest rate. The estimated fair value of our bank borrowings approximated their carrying values at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 based upon prevailing market interest rates for similar debt arrangements.     

(3) 

Our obligation under our senior unsecured notes is classified as Level 3 and thus the fair value is determined using a widely accepted valuation technique, discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows. The discount rate is measured based upon management s estimates of rates currently prevailing for comparable loans available to us, and instruments of comparable maturities. At September 30, 2016, the discount rate used to value our future cash outflow of our senior unsecured notes was 3.75% for those maturing before year 2026 and 3.90% for those maturing at or beyond year 2026. At December 31, 2015, the discount rate used to value our future cash outflow of our senior unsecured notes was 4.35% for those maturing before year 2026 and 4.65% for those maturing at or beyond year 2026.     

(4) 

Our accrued incentives and earn-outs are classified as Level 3. We estimated the fair value of the contingent earn out payments using a discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate that we use consists of a risk free U.S. Treasury rate plus a company specific credit spread which we believe is acceptable by willing market participants. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the discount rate used to value our accrued incentives and earn-outs was 5.4% and 6.1%, respectively.     

11.  Subsequent Events 

Subsequent to September 30, 2016 the following events occurred: 

Real Estate Investments:   We purchased a parcel of land in Illinois and entered into a development commitment to construct a memory care community. The commitment totals approximately $14,500,000, including the land purchase.  

Equity:   We increased our monthly cash dividend approximately 5.6% from $0.18 per share to $0.19 per share and declared monthly cash dividends on our common stock for the months of October,  November and December, payable on October 31, November 30, and December 30, 2016, respectively to stockholders of record on October 21, November 22, and December 22, 2016, respectively.

Executive Overview 

Business and Investment Strategy 

We are a self-administered health care real estate investment trust (or REIT) that invests primarily in seniors housing and health care properties primarily through sale-leaseback transactions, mortgage financing and structured finance solutions including mezzanine lending. We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments, for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. Our primary objectives are to create, sustain and enhance stockholder equity value and provide current income for distribution to stockholders through real estate investments in seniors housing and health care properties managed by experienced operators. Our primary seniors housing and health care property classifications include skilled nursing centers (or SNF), assisted living communities (or ALF), independent living communities (or ILF), memory care communities (or MC) and combinations thereof. ALF, ILF, MC, and combinations thereof are included in the ALF property classification. Range of care communities (or ROC) property classification consists of properties providing skilled nursing and any combination of assisted living, independent living and/or memory care services. As of September 30, 2016, seniors housing and long-term health care properties comprised approximately 99% of our real estate investment portfolio.  We have been operating since August 1992.

Table of Contents  

Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. Our investments in owned properties and mortgage loans represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon the performance of the operators on their lease and loan obligations and the rates earned thereon. To the extent that the operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of health care facility and operator. Our monitoring process includes periodic review of financial statements for each facility, periodic review of operator credit, scheduled property inspections and review of covenant compliance. 

In addition to our monitoring and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Some operating leases and loans are credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates. 

Portfolio Overview 

The following table summarizes our real estate investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016 (  dollar amounts in thousands  ): 

(2) 

Excludes interest income from mortgage loans paid off during 2016.

As of September 30, 2016 we had $1.3 billion in carrying value of net real estate investments, consisting of $1.0 billion or 81.4% invested in owned and leased properties and $0.3 billion or 18.6% invested in mortgage loans secured by first mortgages. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, rental income and interest income from mortgage loans represented 82.6% and 17.0%, respectively, of total gross revenues. In most instances, our lease structure contains fixed annual rental escalations, which are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Certain leases have annual rental escalations that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property.  For those certain leases, the revenue is not recognized until the appropriate contingencies have been resolved. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $8.2 million in straight-line rental income

Health Care Regulatory Climate 

The Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (or CMS) annually updates Medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system rates and other policies. On July 30, 2015, CMS released its final skilled nursing facility prospective payment system update for fiscal year 2016, which began October 1, 2015. CMS projected that aggregate Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities would increase by $430 million, or 1.2%, under the final rule. This increase reflected a 2.3% market basket increase, reduced by both a 0.6 percentage point forecast error adjustment and a 0.5 percentage point multifactor productivity adjustment.  On July 29, 2016, CMS released a final rule updating fiscal year 2017 Medicare payment rates and quality programs for skilled nursing facilities. The final rule provides for a net market basket increase of 2.4 %, beginning October 1, 2016.  This reflects a 2.7% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.3 percentage point multifactor productivity adjustment. CMS estimates that aggregate payments to skilled nursing facilities under the final rule will increase by approximately $920 million.  CMS also adopted new measures and policies for the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program and the Value-Based Purchasing Program. On September 28, 2016, CMS released a final rule revising the requirements that long-term care facilities must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This major rule addresses requirements for improving quality of care and patient safety, nursing facility staffing, care planning, infection control, residents  rights and compliance and ethics programs, and bans pre-dispute arbitration agreements, among several key positions. CMS estimates that the rule, will impose an average cost of $62,900 per facility in the first year and $55,000 per facility per year in subsequent years. There can be no assurance that this rule or future regulations modifying Medicare skilled nursing facility payment rates or other requirements for Medicare and/or Medicaid participation will not have an adverse effect on the financial condition of our borrowers and lessees which could, in turn, adversely impact the timing or level of their payments to us. 

Congress periodically considers legislation revising Medicare policies, including legislation that could have the impact of reducing Medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities and other Medicare providers, encouraging home and community-based long term care services as an alternative to institutional settings, or otherwise reforming payment policy for post-acute care services. There can be no assurances that enacted or future legislation will not have an adverse impact on the financial condition of our borrowers and lessees, which subsequently could materially adversely impact our company. 

Additional reforms affecting the payment for and availability of health care services have been proposed at the state level and adopted by certain states. Increasingly state Medicaid programs are providing coverage through managed care programs under contracts with private health plans, which is intended to decrease state Medicaid costs. Congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies. Changes in the law, new interpretations of existing laws, or changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by the government and other third party payors.

Key Transactions During the Quarter 

During the third quarter, we acquired a parcel of land and improvements in Kentucky for $5.4 million and entered into a development commitment to construct a 143-bed skilled nursing center. The commitment totals $24.3 million, including the land and improvements purchases. The property was added to an existing master lease agreement. Rent on the property will commence upon completion of construction at an initial lease rate of 8.5%. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we purchased a parcel of land in Illinois and entered into a development commitment to construct a memory care community. The commitment totals $14.5 million, including the land purchase. 

During the third  quarter, we completed a 66-unit assisted living community in California, a 66-unit memory care community in Illinois and an 89-unit combination assisted living and memory care community in South Carolina. 

During the third quarter, we received $5.1 million for the sale of a 126-unit assisted living community located in Florida. We recorded a net gain on sale of $2.0 million as a result of this transaction. Also, we sold a school in New Jersey for $3.9 million and recorded a loss on sale of $0.2 million. 

During the third quarter, we originated a $1.4 million mezzanine loan, funding $1.2 million at closing, with a commitment to fund an additional $0.2 million upon achieving certain coverage ratios.  The mezzanine loan is secured by a second mortgage on two skilled nursing centers located in Oregon totaling 146 beds. The mezzanine loan has a five-year term and a rate of 15%. 

During the third quarter, we sold $40.0 million senior unsecured term notes to affiliated insurance company investment advisory clients of AIG Asset Management (U.S.) LLC (or AIG) with a coupon of 3.99%. The notes have scheduled principal payments, an average 10-year life, fixed interest rate and will mature in 2031. 

During the third quarter, we sold 152,623 shares of common stock for $7.7 million in net proceeds under our equity distribution agreements (or Original Agreements). In conjunction with the sale of common stock, we reclassified $0.1 million of accumulated costs associated with the Original Agreements to additional paid in capital. On August 1, 2016, we terminated our Original Agreements and entered into new equity distribution agreements (or Equity Distribution Agreements) to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $200.0 million in aggregate offering price of our company common share. As of September 30, 2016, no shares were issued under these agreements. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, we had $200.0 million available under our Equity Distribution Agreements.  

Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we increased our common stock monthly cash dividend approximately 5.6% from $0.18 per share to $0.19 per share and declared monthly cash dividends on our common stock for the months of October, November and December, payable on October 31, November 30, and December 30, 2016, respectively, to stockholders of record on October 21, November 22, and December 22, 2016, respectively. 

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties 

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business.  These indicators are discussed below and relate to concentration risk and credit strength. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.

Concentration Risk.   We evaluate by gross investment our concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix, operator mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is valuable to understand what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property or mortgage loans. In order to qualify as an equity REIT, at least 75 percent of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items and government securities. Investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property classifications. Operator mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five operators. Geographic mix measures the portion of our investment that relate to our top five states.

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we completed the construction of three assisted living communities totaling 221 units. Accordingly, these properties were reclassified from  Under development  to  Assisted living communities  for all periods presented.

We have four parcels of land as of September 30, 2016. Three parcels of land are located adjacent to properties securing the Prestige mortgage loan and are managed by Prestige.      

Credit Strength.   We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. Our leverage ratios include debt to gross asset value and debt to market capitalization. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our consolidated balance sheet capitalization is related to long term obligations. Our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest plus preferred dividends). The coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before gain on sale of real estate, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (or Adjusted EBITDA). Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures:

In calculating our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios above, we use Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not derived in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (or GAAP) (non-GAAP financial measure). Adjusted EBITDA is not an alternative to net income, operating income or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. You should not rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for any such GAAP financial measures or consider it in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our financial performance, financial position or cash flows. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to 

The status of the economy;     

The status of capital markets, including prevailing interest rates;     

Compliance with and changes to regulations and payment policies within the health care industry;     

Changes in financing terms;     

Competition within the health care and seniors housing industries; and     

Changes in federal, state and local legislation.     

Management regularly monitors the economic and other factors listed above. We develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends.

Funds From Operations Available to Common Stockholders 

Funds from Operations (or FFO) available to common stockholders, basic FFO available to common stockholders per share and diluted FFO available to common stockholders per share are supplemental measures of a REIT s financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, but cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  We believe that by excluding the effect of historical cost depreciation, which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods. 

We use FFO as a supplemental performance measurement of our cash flow generated by operations. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP,   

32 

Table of Contents  

and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income available to common stockholders. 

We calculate and report FFO in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (or NAREIT). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on the sale of real estate and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from us; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our FFO to that of other REITs. 

The following table reconciles GAAP net income available to common stockholders to NAREIT FFO available to common stockholders   (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)  :

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

As of September 30, 2016, we had a total of $3.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $523.0 million available under our unsecured revolving line of credit, $12.5 million available under our senior unsecured note shelf agreement and the potential ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of $200.0 million of common stock under our equity distribution agreements. Furthermore, we have the ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of debt and/ or equity securities under our effective shelf registration. 

We believe that our current cash balance, cash flow from operations available for distribution or reinvestment, our borrowing capacity and our potential ability to access the capital markets are sufficient to provide for payment of our current operating costs, meet debt obligations and pay common dividends at least sufficient to maintain our REIT status and repay borrowings at, or prior to, their maturity. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities   

33 

Table of Contents  

are sensitive to the capital markets environment, especially to changes in interest rates. We continuously evaluate the availability of cost-effective capital and believe we have sufficient liquidity for additional capital investments in 2016 and 2017. 

We expect our future income and ability to make distributions from cash flows from operations to depend on the collectibility of our rents and mortgage loans receivable. The collection of these loans and rents will be dependent, in large part, upon the successful operation by the operators of the seniors housing and health care properties we own or that are pledged to us. The operating results of the facilities will be impacted by various factors over which the operators/owners may have no control. Those factors include, without limitation, the status of the economy, changes in supply of or demand for competing seniors housing and health care facilities, ability to control rising operating costs, and the potential for significant reforms in the health care industry. In addition, our future growth in net income and cash flow may be adversely impacted by various proposals for changes in the governmental regulations and financing of the health care industry. We cannot presently predict what impact these proposals may have, if any. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for the possibility of loans proving uncollectible but we will continually evaluate the financial status of the operations of the seniors housing and health care properties. In addition, we will monitor our borrowers and the underlying collateral for mortgage loans and will make future revisions to the provision, if considered necessary. 

Our investments, principally our investments in mortgage loans and owned properties, are subject to the possibility of loss of their carrying values as a result of changes in market prices, interest rates and inflationary expectations. The effects on interest rates may affect our costs of financing our operations and the fair market value of our financial assets. Generally our loans have predetermined increases in interest rates and our leases have agreed upon annual increases. Inasmuch as we may initially fund some of our investments with variable interest rate debt, we would be at risk of net interest margin deterioration if medium and long-term rates were to increase.   

Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures and construction advances), loan advances and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (  in thousands  ): 

Operating Activities.   Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased to $79.6 million compared to $70.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased operating cash flow from our acquisitions and completed developments and capital improvement projects in 2015 and 2016. 

Investing Activities.   Cash used in investing activities decreased from $263.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $120.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,   

34 

Table of Contents  

2016 primarily due to decreased acquisitions and loan originations partially offset by increased real estate development and capital improvement projects in 2016.  

Financing Activities.   Cash provided by financing activities decreased to $31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $179.0 million for the comparable 2015 period. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to decrease in bank borrowings partially offset by proceeds from common stock offerings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and an increase in distributions paid to stockholders.  

Debt Obligations 

Bank Borrowings.   We have an Unsecured Credit Agreement that provides for a revolving line of credit up to $600.0 million. The Unsecured Credit Agreement matures on October 14, 2018 and provides for a one-year extension option at our discretion, subject to customary conditions. Based on our leverage at September 30, 2016, the facility provides for interest annually at LIBOR plus 150 basis points and an unused commitment fee of 35 basis points. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we borrowed $83.5 million and repaid $127.0 million under our Unsecured Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants. 

Senior Unsecured Notes.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold $37.5 million senior unsecured term notes to affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential with an annual fixed rate of 4.15%. The notes have an average 10-year life, scheduled principal payments and will mature in 2028. Additionally, we amended our agreement with AIG which provides for the possible issuance of up to an additional of $40.0 million of senior unsecured notes and sold $40.0 million senior unsecured term notes to affiliated insurance company investment advisory clients of AIG with a coupon of 3.99%. The notes have an average 10-year life, fixed interest rate and will mature in 2031.  

The following table summarizes information regarding debt obligations by component as of September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Equity 

At September 30, 2016, we had 39,221,681 shares of common stock outstanding, equity on our balance sheet totaled $740.6 million and our equity securities had a market value of $2.0 billion.  

At-The-Market Program.   During 2015, we entered into equity distribution agreements (or Original Agreements) to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $200.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common shares. Sales of common shares are made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions, which may include block trades, or transactions that are deemed to be  at the market  offerings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 1,643,017 shares of common stock for $78.6 million in net proceeds under the Original Agreements. On August 1, 2016, we terminated the Original Agreements and entered into new equity distribution agreements (or Equity Distribution Agreements) to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $200.0 million in aggregate offering price of our company

common share. As of September 30, 2016, no shares were issued under these agreements. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, we had $200.0 million available under our Equity Distribution Agreements.  

At September 30, 2016, we had $200.0 million available under our Equity Distribution Agreements. 

Available Shelf Registrations.     We had an automatic shelf registration statement which was filed in 2013 and provided us with the capacity to publicly offer up to $800.0 million in common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt, depositary shares, or units. In advance of the three-year expiration of the automatic shelf registration statement we filed in 2013, we filed a new automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC on January 29, 2016 to provide us with additional capacity to publicly offer an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt, depositary shares, or units. We may from time to time raise capital under the automatic registration statement we filed in 2016 (until its expiration on January 29, 2019) in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of the offering. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

There have been no material changes from the critical accounting policies as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

We are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, which in our opinion are not singularly or in the aggregate anticipated to be material to our results of operations or financial condition. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against the lessees or borrowers related to our properties, which we believe under applicable legal principles are not our responsibility as a non-possessory landlord or mortgage holder. We believe that these matters are the responsibility of our lessees and borrowers pursuant to general legal principles and pursuant to insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases or mortgages. We intend to continue to vigorously defend such claims and lawsuits.
